Some businesses like to consistently bid on their brand names while others completely avoid it. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer, but brand advertising is a consideration every business undertakes at one point or another.<\/p>\n<p>However, as the ad platforms change their offerings over time, you might end up wanting to rethink how you\u2019re approaching your brand strategy.<\/p>\n<p>For example, one such change has been the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> updates to Google Ads match types<\/a> over the last couple of years.

Prior to these new brand controls, advertisers would have no way of filtering their broad-match branded keywords&#8217; potentially matching search queries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Up until recently, your branded keywords set on broad match would have shown to anything <em>contextually similar<\/em> to your brand name and its variations. Instead, with Google Ads restrictions for brands applied, advertisers can now have the peace of mind that their branded keywords will only match to people looking specifically for their business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Google does this by tying lists of brands to campaigns to ensure relevancy.

But based on the functionality of brand lists, there are a few other ways you can use them. Here are a couple of quick tips for how you can leverage this type of Google Ads restriction:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Create separate lists for products and sub-brands<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Many brands have their business name as part of their cohesive brand, but there are likely other trademarked terms and products that live within that brand as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands.jpg\" alt=\"google ads restrictions - brands and sub brands\" width=\"900\" height=\"255\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76063 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands-480x136.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>I<\/span><span>n the example above, Coca-Cola has its core brands, but you\u2019ll also see slight variants for Coke Zero, Coke Vanilla, and bigger deviations like Sprite, Fanta, Dasani, and Minute Maid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For these brands and sub-brands, I would suggest creating individual brand lists for each so you\u2019re able to easily keep them separate. Clearly, some of these brands are quite a bit different than others, so it\u2019s likely better to target someone interested in Minute Maid differently than Vanilla Coke, but your specific strategy will depend on your brands, sub-brands, and the differences (or similarities) between them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>When it comes to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> campaign structure<\/a>, you could go one of two ways: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Create individual campaigns for each brand and apply only that brand\u2019s brand list to the campaign, or<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Create a single \u201cbrand\u201d campaign that houses all of your brand names, then apply multiple Brand Lists to that campaign to capture all relevant search traffic.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>The only limitation will be the 10-list maximum on a single campaign. Otherwise, the structure option you choose is up to your personal preference. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>2. Consider your competitor brands<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>You may have noticed that this brand library is open to everyone, not just the company that owns the brand name. What\u2019s to stop me from creating a brand list of all my competitors and focusing on their terms as well? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Honestly, nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So while there is some debate (or at least personal preference) in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">whether or not you should be bidding on your competitors\u2019 terms<\/a> in Search campaigns, there\u2019s no doubt that brand lists could be a great way to help you reach users searching for your competitors&#8217; brands on the Google network. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span>Use Google Ads restrictions with brand lists to your advantage<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Brand lists are an exciting new tool for advertisers to leverage in their search campaigns. This shows Google is paying attention to concerns and struggles brands have had and are working to help them address those issues.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s yet to be seen how perfectly effective these lists are, but it\u2019s a welcome change in the interface.
