You\u2019ve got a big red button, a blue background (that universally appealing color, right?), and the word \u201cFREE\u201d in there five times. This ad design is going to do great! Right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But then the click-through rate <em>dropped <\/em>by .5%? Huh.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-confusion.jpg\" alt=\"confusion\" width=\"500\" height=\"314\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019ve designed at least a hundred display ads over the course of my career, so I\u2019m all too familiar with the confusion and disappointment of seeing your ad go <em>wrong<\/em> when you theoretically followed all of the textbook rules to get it <em>right<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s the thing: <strong>Those textbook rules of ad design aren\u2019t always right for <em>your <\/em>campaign or your company. <\/strong>I\u2019m going to share the seven biggest ad design lessons I\u2019ve learned in my career as a designer so that you can get your display ad creative on track.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. It\u2019s not about the colors, it\u2019s about the contrast<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I can\u2019t tell you how many blog posts I\u2019ve read over the years that get into the great button color debate. What color button performs best? Well, I\u2019m here to tell you once and for all, the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/inline-images\/ad-design-orange.gif?fIgMaXTi33TPvhZNxRipcZiK_Qwb2S58\">definitive answer is <\/a><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/inline-images\/ad-design-orange.gif?fIgMaXTi33TPvhZNxRipcZiK_Qwb2S58\">orange<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just kidding!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In reality, there is no hard and fast answer here, and a lot of it comes down to a) your audience and b) a little design principle called contrast. This <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/20566\/the-button-color-a-b-test-red-beats-green.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study from Hubspot<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> might, at first glance, appear to suggest that red buttons <em>do<\/em> perform better than green buttons. But a closer look at the page designs will reveal that both Performable\u2019s logo and website used a lot of green. What contrasts well against green? Red. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-button-contrast.jpg\" alt=\"ad design button contrast image\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So how do you take advantage of contrast in your ads? The easiest way to find opposite colors is to revisit our old friend, <a href=\"https:\/\/coschedule.com\/blog\/color-psychology-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the color wheel<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-color-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"color wheel\" width=\"820\" height=\"820\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Find the most dominant color in your ad, and move to the exact opposite end of the color wheel to find your contrasting color.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Need some help creating color schemes for your ads? There are tons of excellent free color palette tools out there, but some of my favorites are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/colors\/color-palettes\/\">Canva\u2019s Color Palettes<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and <a href=\"https:\/\/color.adobe.com\/create\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adobe Color<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, which lets you select a complementary (a.k.a., opposite) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/03\/website-color-scheme\">color scheme<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-color-display-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"display ad example with contrasting colors\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">The orange button pops against the blue background.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Color isn\u2019t the only way to create a sense of contrast in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/02\/banner-ads-examples\">banner ads<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">\u2014<span lang=\"EN\">you can also play with things like brightness, saturation, and scale to make your button stand out more. Heck, I\u2019ve created high-performing banners that didn\u2019t even have buttons, but we\u2019ll get to that in the next section.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Keep your ad design simple<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Communicating your message in the simplest, cleanest way is critical for successful ad creative. After all, only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingweek.com\/2016\/07\/26\/marketers-continue-to-waste-money-as-only-9-of-digital-ads-are-viewed-for-more-than-a-second\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9% of display ads<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> are viewed for more than one second, and that shrinks down to a measly 4% for over two seconds. If a prospect can\u2019t immediately understand your ad, they\u2019re not going to click, let alone remember who you are. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Below is an example of an ad that <em>didn\u2019t<\/em> perform well for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-keep-it-simple-display-ad.jpg\" alt=\"display ad example with too much going on\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The contrast of the button looks good, so why didn\u2019t this ad do well? Let\u2019s dive into the problematic parts of this banner (and for the record, I made this, so I\u2019m allowed to talk trash about it). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For one, there\u2019s too much copy here. Between the headline, subheading, button, and the \u201cSafe &amp; Secure\u201d text, there\u2019s so much happening that you don\u2019t even know where to look first. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> copy itself is too ambiguous (and probably wouldn\u2019t fly with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6008942?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s current policies<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">). And the visual theme, which could be compelling, is too busy for such a small composition. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s how I would make this better today:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-keep-it-simple-display-ad-revision.jpg\" alt=\"ad design revision\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So much nicer, right? A concise headline with better <a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/landing-pages\/increase-conversions-by-improving-the-clarity-of-your-value-proposition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">value prop clarity<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> paired with a more direct call-to-action and a cleaned up design makes for a much better ad.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Context is key<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Have you ever taken a high-performing ad from one platform and moved it onto another, just to discover that same creative <em>tanked<\/em> on the other platform?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Yeah, ditto. That is why it\u2019s critical to consider the context in which your ad will be displayed when you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/27\/design-thinking\">think about the design<\/a>. When I first started at WordStream and was just beginning to get a feel for our brand, I was tasked with making some new sidebar ads for our Google Ads Performance Grader. I felt good about how clean and modern my ad looked. I was certain it would perform well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In reality:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-keep-it-simple-context.jpg\" alt=\"Drake with display ads\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So what gives? What\u2019s the magic ingredient at play here? I\u2019ll give you a hint: It\u2019s context! While that top ad might perform great on the Google Display Network (GDN), appearing on websites that have nary to do with WordStream, it did poorly on our own website because it <strong>felt too much like an ad. <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We\u2019ve found ads on our website tend to perform better when they work together to create a cohesive experience with the site itself. Otherwise, banner blindness comes in to play. Creating ads that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blend in with your website<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> is a great way to improve your clicks and conversions for on-site native ads.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Likewise, you may find certain ad formats tend to perform better on some networks than others. You might see great results with static images on GDN, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/insights\/creative-combinations-that-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Facebook<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> a combined approach of image and video drives the most conversions on their platform. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">carousel ads<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> tend to perform especially well for ecommerce businesses.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Copy and ad design = BFFs<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m not a copywriter. My brief desire to become a short story writer was quickly squashed by my 10th grade English teacher. Regardless, I recognize how important it is to have engaging copy in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/29\/youtube-display-ads\">display ads<\/a> that I design. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s important to develop copy and design in tandem when planning an ad campaign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Too many words will not only make a banner feel cluttered, but they will also make it much harder to effectively communicate your value prop. Less is definitely more when it comes to display ad copy. This banner redesign for Delta does a great job of stripping down the messaging to the most important parts (you can also see how they\u2019ve improved their button contrast):<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-delta-version-one.jpg\" alt=\"Delta ad design version one\" width=\"768\" height=\"488\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-delta-version-two.jpg\" alt=\"Delta ad design version two\" width=\"768\" height=\"501\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Source: <\/span><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/gabrielshaoolian\/2016\/04\/08\/effective-banner-designs-real-world-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Forbes<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Concise ad copy is especially important when considering mobile views (not to mention cramming more than five\u00a0words into a 320&#215;100 banner is one of my least favorite tasks).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Use seasonality to refresh your creative<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Aside from being great fuel for clever copywriting, utilizing holidays and seasonality in your ads is a great way to refresh existing campaigns throughout the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-seasonality.jpg\" alt=\"Halloween-themed display ad\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019m not gonna lie and tell you this <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN\">isn\u2019t<em> the best thing I\u2019ve ever written.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Take the above ad I created for one of our guides\u2013we have a standard ad we promote throughout the year, but for Halloween we decided to have a little fun and it <strong>really paid off.<\/strong> We saw a huge bump in click-through rate and conversion rate, and we were genuinely bummed to have turn it off after Halloween was over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just remember to be considerate of your audiences when making seasonal or holiday-themed ads. While it\u2019s heating up for summer here in Boston, Australia is starting to cool off for winter<span lang=\"EN\">\u2014<span lang=\"EN\">and your Fourth of July themed ad is likely to fall flat in geographies outside of the USA.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Take advantage of free resources<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Not every business can afford to hire a full-time designer or wants to splurge on a stock photo subscription when they\u2019re just getting started, so it\u2019s a good idea to make use of all the great free tools that are available (hot tip<span lang=\"EN\">\u2014<span lang=\"EN\">you <em>cannot <\/em>just pull images from Google and use them in your ads). In addition to the color palette resources I mentioned above, here are a few other free tools I can personally recommend.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Moat, the GOAT of competitive creative analysis<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While <a href=\"https:\/\/moat.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moat<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> offers a paid product with more in-depth data, their free banner ad search tool is a FANTASTIC place to start if you\u2019re looking for some creative inspiration. Simply type in an existing brand, and Moat will return with several examples of ad creative that has been run by that particular brand.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-free-display-ad-tools.jpg\" alt=\"Moat example\" width=\"768\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Be sure to use this information responsibly. Just because someone <em>has<\/em> done something, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it performed well for them. Consider this more of a jumping off point if you\u2019re stuck.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Unsplash, for free stock photos that don\u2019t suck<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Even with access to a paid stock resource, I find myself occasionally browsing <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unsplash<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, simply because the images are often superior to what I can dig up on your typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/22\/best-practices-stock-photos\">stock photo<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> sites. The photography is high-quality and modern, plus it feels more natural than some of the stereotypical uncomfortably posed stock out there.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-free-display-ad-tools-salad.jpg\" alt=\"happy woman eating salad with &quot;nobody does this&quot; overlay\" width=\"800\" height=\"576\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Am I the only one that cries when I eat salad?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>7. Kill your darlings<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">My final tip is arguably the most important: Don\u2019t be married to your ideas! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As a creative, I totally understand how easy it is to get emotionally attached to something you\u2019ve poured hours of work into. Learn to separate what you <em>think <\/em>is good from what actually performs well (see our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/30\/best-display-ad-examples\">best display ad picks from 2020<\/a>), because this is something that will be different for every business and every audience. Maybe you think cats are hysterical, but your audience LOVES dogs<span lang=\"EN\">\u2014<span lang=\"EN\">that\u2019s totally ok (but cats are better).<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-design-kill-your-darlings.jpg\" alt=\"your opinion, man meme\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Good art may be subjective, but <a href=\"https:\/\/uxmag.com\/articles\/designing-objectively\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good ad design is <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/uxmag.com\/articles\/designing-objectively\"><em>objective<\/em><\/a><em><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN\">How something makes you feel might affect another person in an entirely different way based on their individual upbringing and life experiences (this is why I take oversimplification of color psychology with a big ol\u2019 grain of salt). Learn what your audiences like by testing new creative frequently, and set up A\/B tests to help you nail down just what the secret ingredient is that\u2019s making a campaign a top performer.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Designing high-performing creative can be <em>hard<\/em>, but don\u2019t get discouraged<span lang=\"EN\">\u2014<span lang=\"EN\">by testing and iterating often, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns that you can use to inform your future campaigns and the process will feel a little easier every time.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get ready for a crash course in display ad design: WordStream&#8217;s in-house design expert shares the seven most
