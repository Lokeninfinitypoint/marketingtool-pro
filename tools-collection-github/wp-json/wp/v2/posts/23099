What started off as a normal check-in turned into a huge wake-up call.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we looked at the amount of money we spent nurturing prospects to become customers, we were embarrassed that we didn\u2019t spend the same amount, or even remotely close to the same amount, for our current customers,\u201d said Kristen.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s really no definitive answer, but sources say that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/what-cost-customer-acquisition-vs-retention-ian-kingwill\">the cost of acquiring a new customer<\/a> is <strong>up to 30 times<\/strong> that of keeping an existing one. And the good old 80\/20 rule tells us that 20% of your customers bring you 80% of your revenue.<\/p>\n<p>According to Kristen, \u201cAs we matured as a company, it became very apparent that customers not only valued our product, but also valued the fact we were subject matter experts in the area of SEM (Search Engine Marketing). The Customer Success team not only teaches customers the software, we also <a href=\"\/learn\">teach them PPC<\/a>, and how to be better paid search marketers.\u201dcus<\/p>\n<p>Part of this education came in the form of monthly customer-only webinars. \u201cThe monthly webinars we were doing had insanely high attendance rates,\u201d Kristen said. \u201cCustomers were also asking for more product information. What has changed? How do they use tools? What PPC strategies can be employed via WordStream?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When looking at all those factors, <strong>adding a Customer Marketer to the WordStream team was a no-brainer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>From that day forward, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">customer retention<\/a> became a major focal point for WordStream. And that\u2019s where I came into the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Before diving into the good stuff, let me share a little about myself. I wasn\u2019t always a Customer Marketer. I spent the last five years in the world of prospect marketing, focusing my efforts on generating qualified leads for Sales. When the opportunity arose to become the company\u2019s first Customer Marketer, I hung up my lead gen jacket <em>(not to be confused with a jean jacket, I\u2019m not that cool)<\/em>, and decided to shift my focus to helping WordStream customers.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Customer Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re asking yourself \u201cWhat the heck is Customer Marketing?\u201d here\u2019s my definition<strong>: <\/strong><strong>Customer marketing targets activities and campaigns designed specifically to drive retention, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">customer loyalty<\/a>, advocacy, growth and community participation for current customers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My role at WordStream has been to educate, inform, and assist customers at every stage of their journey, whether newcomer or professional, and to provide outstanding customer service to enhance their WordStream experience. Being the first person at WordStream to take the lead on customer marketing, I had to build the role from the ground up\u2026seriously, we had zip, nothing, nada!<\/p>\n<p>Making the transition to customer marketing has been an extremely rewarding experience. I may sound a bit biased, but I truly believe WordStream has the greatest customers. I\u2019ve heard first-hand some truly incredible customer stories and have seen the rise of passionate WordStream advocates.<\/p>\n<p>Due to all this amazing customer activity, I wanted to share my experience in the hopes of sparking some ideas and creativity for companies looking to get their customer marketing efforts off the ground. Here are five customer marketing strategies I\u2019ve used over the past year and a half that have helped keep WordStream <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ideas-for-happy-customers\/\">customers very happy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Make a Great First Impression<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re on a first date and you spend more time looking at your phone than conversing with the person sitting across from you, the chances of landing a second date are slim. The same goes with your customers. If you start off with a bad first impression, don\u2019t expect them to stick around for long.<\/p>\n<h3>Set Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>To start off on the right foot with your customers, make sure you\u2019re setting proper expectations. Here at WordStream, after a new customer signs on, they\u2019re handed over to our Customer Success team, who will work with them on on-boarding and software training. Their sales rep\u2019s initial email sets the proper expectations and lets the customer know exactly what to do next.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ea028a59-f439-4b3c-aef7-a9ec657529e4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-first-impression.png\" alt=\"customer marketing tips\" width=\"594\" height=\"265\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If possible, use video to further explain the on-boarding process and set expectations. Some excellent video production companies I recommend are <a href=\"http:\/\/simplifilm.com\/\">Simplifilm<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/lessfilms.com\/\">LessFilms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Customized Experience<\/h3>\n<p>This is a key <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">customer retention strategy<\/a>. No one customer is the same as any other. They all have different learning levels and experience, and they come from a wide array of industries.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we build out a personalized training curriculum that fit the varying needs of every customer. . One of the first things we ask customers when they come on board with us is to provide us with some details so that we can find out who they are and what their needs are.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5a8cdee7-9137-4cb6-bf68-1c9fc21720cc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-survey-1.png\" alt=\"customer marketing survey\" width=\"405\" height=\"273\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e957bf30-120e-4a7b-9c8d-826ced7f6d77\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-survey-2.png\" alt=\"customer marketing strategy\" width=\"401\" height=\"243\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c95842c9-f53a-440c-b471-6effed6bab2b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-survey-3.png\" alt=\"how to do customer marketing\" width=\"406\" height=\"159\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>With this information, we build out a personalized training curriculum that is completely tailored around the customer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"25e462d9-188b-4f87-8470-0719585decea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-training-curriculum.png\" alt=\"customer marketing and training\" width=\"565\" height=\"622\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Awesome, right?

Put Your Customers In The Spotlight<\/h2>\n<p>What better way for your customers to learn than from their peers, who are likely going through similar relatable experiences?<\/p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on thought leadership here at WordStream, but when the idea came to me to let our customers be the teachers and give them a voice, we jumped at the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Once per month, we feature one of our customers on the WordStream blog. We call it our \u201c<a href=\"\/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=191\">Customer Spotlight<\/a>\u201d series. Our customers share a little back story about themselves and their business, then they dive into their PPC experience and share tips and tricks on how they\u2019ve become successful online advertisers. (Here\u2019s the <a href=\"\/testimonials\">full archive<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"26b3f931-ed76-4051-a536-d86a4f6d5c9d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-spotlight-koru-k91-1.jpg\" alt=\"customer spotlight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The Customer Spotlights have also been a great source of brand exposure for our customers. Sometimes, small businesses don\u2019t have time for PR, since they often have a small team trying to do it all. Take <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/19\/customer-spotlight-koru-k9-dog-training\">Koru K9 Dog Training<\/a>, above. We\u2019re happy to raise awareness for customers like these!<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Get Personal With Face-to-Face Events<\/h2>\n<p>In this day in age, technology is our main source of managing communications with our customers. We rely heavily on email and online chats to provide support to our customers. Let\u2019s face it though:\u00a0<strong>nothing beats a face-to-face interaction<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the resources, I highly recommend trying out a live, in-person event. Recently, we teamed up with our friends over at Google and had our very first customer event, live at Google\u2019s office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was a huge milestone for WordStream as a company.<\/p>\n<p>We took our expertise that customers know and love, and brought it from online to the big stage. Not only did customers benefit from all the great educational presentations we had lined up, but <em>we benefited too!<\/em> Listening to our customers face-to-face and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">getting direct feedback <\/a>on our product and services was invaluable. It was also very rewarding to hear how much WordStream\u2019s software was helping them, as small businesses, succeed at PPC.<\/p>\n<p>Overall the event was great and customers had a blast. But if you\u2019re not ready for a big event, try testing out some small local meetups.<\/p>\n<p>The point I\u2019m trying to make here is, taking the relationship to a more personal level is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">great marketing strategy<\/a> because it creates this \u201chumanized\u201d experience with your customers. <strong>We\u2019re people working with people, and we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that.<\/strong> Here are some photos from the event\u2026<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c11de761-f0d1-435b-a388-ee72bd612625\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-google-customer-event.jpg\" alt=\"customer marketing event\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fc386ea0-496e-461c-981f-e8407fd8e804\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-marketing-event-happy-hour.jpg\" alt=\"customer meetup\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>We had a little too much fun with the photo booth. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6d61ffed-ad2c-4863-9bc9-1144040e1071\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/photobooth-collage.jpg\" alt=\"customer marketing photos\" width=\"759\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#4.
