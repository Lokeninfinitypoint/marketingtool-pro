Consumers expect businesses to have websites today, and a bad website can be worse than no website at all. Here are some ideas to get your website marketing your real estate business around the clock.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Have an impressive homepage<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kinesisinc.com\/the-truth-about-web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">75%<\/a> of people admit to judging the credibility of a business based on its website design? First impressions matter, which is why your homepage should be in top shape. This means vibrant images, a prominent call to action, and an intuitive menu.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1.png\" alt=\"real estate marketing ideas - impressive homepage example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58781\" width=\"720\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1-480x287.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Create awesome listings<\/h3>\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers like to do a lot of legwork themselves online when making major purchases, and that includes home buying as well. I myself have only rented, but even then, when scouting around, I\u2019ll Google Map the address, use Street View to get a feel for the area, see which businesses are within walking distance, look at home photos, and, ideally take a virtual tour of the property.<\/p>\n<p>Your property pages and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listings<\/a> should make it easy for users to access all this information\u2014with detailed descriptions, great photos, virtual tours, and easy access to Google Maps and Google Earth. List the hot spots nearby and their respective walking distances (mention the bus stop that\u2019s just a five-minute walk, or the Starbucks at the end of the block).<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i><\/i><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3<strong>Want to keep the free leads flowing?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Hire a photographer<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s absolutely vital that you have gorgeous photos of your properties. The right time of day or angle can make all the difference. Hire a professional photographer (preferably with experience photographing homes and architecture), or, if you have sophisticated equipment and are confident in your abilities, have your own hand at it. Just remember this is one of those scenarios when it pays to bring in the professionals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo.png\" alt=\"real estate marketing ideas - vibrant homepage image\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58729\" width=\"550\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo.png 550w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo-480x367.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Create lead magnets<\/h3>\n<p>The key to generating leads is to offer something to your audience that is worth giving up their contact information for. Consider producing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnet<\/a> guide like \u201cX Common Mistakes New Homeowners Make&#8221; or &#8220;X Features to Look For In a New Home.&#8221; things new homeowners should consider before buying\u201d or \u201cX most valuable features of a new home.\u201d Offering free ebooks in exchange for an email address (and zip code, in the case of real estate) is a great way to capture high-quality leads.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Focus on user experience<\/h3>\n<p>All the great property pages in the world won\u2019t mean much if your site is a nightmare to navigate. Your visitors need to have a good experience on your website, so take the time to brush up on user experience design skills and information architecture.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Do your SEO<\/h3>\n<p>A great-looking website does nothing for you if no one can find it! SEO is a set of practices that work together to get your site to rank high in search engines. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-page SEO:<\/strong> Including the keywords you&#8217;re targeting for each page in that page&#8217;s title, meta data, image file names and alt text, and naturally in the body text.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Off-page SEO:<\/strong> Getting other sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">high domain authority<\/a> to link to yours.

Add social share buttons to property pages<\/h3>\n<p>Home shoppers are eager to share their top housing pics with friends and family, so make it easy for them to email and share various properties online by adding social sharing buttons.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings.png\" alt=\"real estate marketing ideas - shareable listing example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58711\" width=\"603\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings.png 603w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings-480x330.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 603px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>11. Run social ads<\/h3>\n<p>Regular Facebook marketing is great for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/21\/build-client-relationships\">building client relationships<\/a>, but if you&#8217;re looking to land new clients, you won&#8217;t get far.

Pinterest boards<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/09\/pinterest-video-ads\">Pinterest advertising<\/a> and marketing still have their place for some industries\u2014real estate being one of them.

You can create a Pinterest board for a single property that, in addition, to property photos, highlights features and benefits of the area.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pinterest-marketing-realestate.png\" alt=\"pinterest real estate marketing\" width=\"703\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"local\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Local real estate marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Your website and social media profiles are two of the three basic pillars of your real estate marketing strategy.

Local content on your website<\/h3>\n<p>In many ways, you\u2019re not just selling a house, you\u2019re selling a whole town or area. Showcase the best that your area has to offer, with high-quality, beautiful photos of local town landmarks and familiar sites.<\/p>\n<p>Also, make sure you are including some local-oriented keywords in your copy to ensure that your content is found by buyers Googling online for homes in your area.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; align-content: space-evenly; border-top: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px !important; padding-right: 10px;\">Brought to you by<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/WS-Logo-2023.webp\" alt=\"wordstream logo\" width=\"130\" height=\"auto\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">Ready to grow your business?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 70%; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Unlock the results you\u2019re looking for with technology-backed solutions designed for small businesses and agencies.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin: auto;\"><a style=\"padding: 10px 50px; border-radius: 24px; background-color: #0047ff; color: #f9f5ea; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.background='#0097ff'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.background='#0047ff'\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;itm_content=incontent_links_htmldesign\">Get your free demo<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>15.

Become a columnist in local magazines<\/h3>\n<p>See if you can write a column or feature for local publications. You don\u2019t want to be blatantly salesy. Today\u2019s consumers don\u2019t like to be pitched to. Instead, share advice and perspectives that add value. Write about how rising prices of houses on the market show that the town is doing well, or list the reasons why your regional area is becoming more popular (maybe it\u2019s the revitalized downtown area or improved school system).<\/p>\n<h3>17. Host free seminars for home buyers<\/h3>\n<p>Make yourself and your knowledge available to the community by hosting mini-seminars. Consider providing a basic 101 seminar about the basics of home buying and mortgages.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, marketing today is all about inbound, and that doesn\u2019t just apply online. Users want you to share some of your knowledge for free before investing time and money in you. A home buying seminar is the local equivalent of a webinar. Yes, it will take time and energy, but attendees will walk away impressed and will have established a relationship with you. That relationship will be worth its weight in gold when they\u2019re ready to shop for a home.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Partner with local businesses<\/h3>\n<p>Developing relationships with other local businesses will be key for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/05\/instagram-ads-for-real-estate\">real estate marketing<\/a> efforts. See if you can get local breakfast joints to let you buy them a set of new coffee mugs with your logo on them, or buy a place on their paper placemat setting. Or partner up with local moving companies to swap referrals.<br \/>\n<a id=\"email\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Real estate email marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Email marketing has long been one of the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/18\/best-marketing-strategies\"> best marketing strategies<\/a> for any industry and for any stage of the funnel. Here are some real estate marketing ideas using email.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Create a newsletter<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">Collect email signups<\/a> via your website and events and send out a helpful newsletter with new listings, upcoming seminars you&#8217;re offering, local events, tips, and more. Be sure to segment your lists out by different communities so you can provide super-relevant content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup.png\" alt=\"real estate marketing ideas - email newsletter signup\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58714\" width=\"500\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup-480x426.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>It also helps to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">creative newsletter signup CTA<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>20. Start an email nurture campaign<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/26\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\/\">Nurture campaigns<\/a> are like the breadcrumb paths of Hansel and Gretel, except instead of a gingerbread house at the end, clients find their dream home (hopefully without a resident evil witch).<\/p>\n<p>Leave your clients a trail of high-end panko breadcrumbs by tailoring your interactions with them based on previous actions they\u2019ve taken. If they first attended an open house with you, send them an email detailing other nearby houses on the market. If they attended your first-time homebuyer\u2019s seminar, send them your \u201c10 Things Every New Homebuyer Should Know \u201c ebook. Deliver content that will help your clients take the appropriate next step, depending on where they are in their journey.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Send out greeting emails<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simple but smart <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing tip<\/a>: send out personalized emails during the holidays or even on your clients&#8217; birthdays or anniversaries. A simple gesture can go a long way, and happy clients will be eager to refer you to others in need of your services. Just don&#8217;t go with a generic email! Use these posts for inspiration:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/04\/valentines-day-messages-clients\">Valentine&#8217;s Day Messages for Your Clients (With Email Templates!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/29\/holiday-customer-appreciation-letter\">11 Creative Customer Holiday Greeting Email Ideas and Examples<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"offline\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Offline real estate marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<p>With all this digital marketing talk, let&#8217;s not forget about the physical world!

Branded swag<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/23\/how-brand-your-business\">Business branding<\/a> is your buddy \u2013 that means pens, drink koozies, and all those other freebies people love. Give out some branded goodies at local festivals and events to spread your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag.jpeg\" alt=\"real estate marketing ideas branded swag\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58787\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag-480x269.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>23. Use call tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Real estate is one of those industries that absolutely must use call tracking in their paid search campaigns. Most people use the phone when trying to find a realtor or make an appointment to view an apartment, condo, or house.
