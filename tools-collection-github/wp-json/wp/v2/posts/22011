First, we\u2019ll define what <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/26\/content-promotion-strategies\">content amplification<\/a> actually is, before taking a look at several reasons why it\u2019s such an essential part of your wider digital marketing strategy.

There\u2019s a lot to cover, so let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Content Amplification?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Content amplification is the process of helping your content reach a significantly wider audience<\/strong> \u2013 hence, \u201camplifying\u201d the signal of your content. Another way to think of it is in the classic signal vs. noise metaphor often used in content marketing. Your content is the signal, and everything else is the noise. When you put it in these terms, the concept of content amplification becomes a lot clearer.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-grateful-dead-wall-of-sound.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification Grateful Dead Wall of Sound\" width=\"943\" height=\"629\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>The Grateful Dead\u2019s now-legendary on-stage amplification system, \u201cThe Wall of Sound,\u201d in 1974.

With <strong>almost three million blog posts published every single day<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/blogs\/\">yes, really<\/a>), there\u2019s plenty of noise out there \u2013 and your signal is competing with all of it.<\/p>\n<p>Granted, there aren\u2019t almost three million blog posts published in your specific niche every single day, but the sheer, terrifying volume of worthless, poorly written garbage on the Web is absolutely amazing.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the nightmarish levels of competition and the intensity of maintaining daily (or even more frequent) publishing schedules, content amplification is crucial to today\u2019s content marketing professionals because social media channels and, to a large extent, search giants like Google itself, are heavily prioritizing paid content over organic results.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon has hit social media marketers particularly hard, with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/12\/facebook-organic-reach\">Facebook\u2019s organic reach declining sharply<\/a> over a relatively short period of time.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-facebook-declining-organic-reach.png\" alt=\"Content amplification declining organic reach on Facebook\" width=\"642\" height=\"482\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/social.ogilvy.com\/facebook-zero-considering-life-after-the-demise-of-organic-reach\/\"><em>social@Ogilvy<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The figure above, originally published by Ogilvy, shows the shocking decline of organic content on Facebook between October 2013 and February 2014 \u2013 a period of just four months. Today, organic reach on Facebook is even lower, with some publishers\u2019 fans seeing an average of just 2% of organic posts published in certain cases.<\/p>\n<p>However, the bad news doesn\u2019t stop there. Last year, BuzzSumo analyzed one million blog posts (yes, really) to see how people interacted with content online. <a href=\"http:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/blog\/50-of-content-gets-8-shares-or-less-why-content-fails-and-how-to-fix-it\/\">The results<\/a> showed just how competitive the content marketing landscape really is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of randomly selected posts received fewer than eight social shares in total<\/li>\n<li>75% received fewer than 39 social shares in total<\/li>\n<li>75% received ZERO referring domain links<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-buzzsumo-blog-data.png\" alt=\"Content amplification BuzzSumo content survey data\" width=\"733\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Image via BuzzSumo<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These figures are a sobering reminder that, despite our best efforts, most content fails \u2013 hard. Other studies have yielded similarly depressing results. According to data from Trackmaven, 42% of professionally marketed blog posts receive fewer than 10 interactions. Despite the myriad <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/benefits-of-content-marketing\">benefits of content marketing<\/a>, it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to make an impact.<\/p>\n<p>If experienced professionals face these kind of odds, it may be tempting for small businesses and new blogs to think that the content ship has sailed; that you\u2019re too late to the party, or can\u2019t compete with larger companies and teams. Although solid organic traffic is certainly possible with patience, a commitment to publishing quality content, and a keen awareness of on-page SEO elements, relying upon organic traffic solely is a one-way ticket to crisis. In today\u2019s digital media landscape, the reality is that you have to pay to play.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the better you know the game, the more likely you are to win \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes content amplification so powerful.<\/p>\n<h2>Content Amplification Strategies (or How to Stop Gigging in Bars and Start Playing Stadiums)<\/h2>\n<p>Is your blog more like the scrappy (possibly crappy) indie band you\u2019d expect to see droning on stage at your local dive bar, or more like the Rolling Stones?

Follow these highly actionable strategies to amplify your content and reach a whole new level of readership and conversion opportunities.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Strategy #1: Only Amplify Your Very Best Content<\/h3>\n<p>Remember how we described the content creation process as a cruel, wicked mistress that seeks to chain us to our desks for all time and torture us with her mocking laughter? Well, after enduring a trial as arduous as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing an awesome blog post<\/a>, it\u2019s tempting to think of everything you produce as excellent \u2013 a unicorn, as Larry would say.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-fat-unicorn.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification fat unicorn\" width=\"785\" height=\"664\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, as even the youngest of children could tell you, unicorns are so prized because of their rarity. If every blog post or white paper were a unicorn, then we\u2019d have to find another equally graceful and elusive mythological beast after which to chase.<\/p>\n<p>The harsh reality is that, sadly, most content is more like a donkey than a unicorn. And, as Larry has warned us in the past, you shouldn\u2019t send donkeys into space as, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bruceclay.com\/blog\/video-larry-kim-super-remarketing\/\">They can\u2019t withstand the rigors of space travel<\/a>\u201d (a limitation that unicorns presumably lack).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-donkey-in-space-1.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification donkey in a spacesuit\" width=\"511\" height=\"638\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>\u201cWHAT NOW LARRY\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Paying to promote your content (a strategy sometimes referred to as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/28\/content-advertising\">content advertising<\/a>) can be extraordinarily cost effective. However, with competitive pricing comes the temptation to promote everything. After all, the more people that see it, the more effectively you\u2019re amplifying your content, right?<\/p>\n<p>Wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Content amplification is useless unless you\u2019re promoting the very best content you have \u2013 the top 1-2% of your most exceptional content. Even paid social\u2019s comparably competitive ROI doesn\u2019t mean you should pay to promote <em>all<\/em> your content \u2013 only the very best.<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you an example of what amplifying \u201cunicorn\u201d content looks like. A while back, we published <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/google-plus-photos-streams\">a blog post about the slow, agonizing death of Google+<\/a>, the search giant\u2019s ailing social network. We were among the first to break the story \u2013 including even dedicated news teams at large media companies \u2013 and we paid to promote the post via Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-only-promote-best-content.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification Larry Kim only promote your best content\" width=\"638\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Twitter.com screenshot of the Promoted Tweet shortly after publication<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We knew this story was going to be huge, so we spent a little money to promote it \u2013 just $250, to be precise. That initial investment not only netted Larry almost 1,500 retweets, but earned the site more than 100,000 visitors in direct referral traffic \u2013 an absolutely insane (as Larry might say) ROI for such a meagre advertising spend.<\/p>\n<p>This post remains one of WordStream\u2019s most-shared and most-read articles, and smart content amplification helped this happen.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Strategy #2: Leverage the Power of Influencer Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>You already know that your content needs to be as good as it possibly can be if it\u2019s to have any chance of succeeding. You also know that you should only be paying to amplify your very best content. But what about who should be reading \u2013 and sharing \u2013 it?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-influencer-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification and influencer marketing\" width=\"620\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Getting influential people to help spread the word about your content (commonly known as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing<\/a>) can be extraordinarily powerful, but it\u2019s tricky to get right and there\u2019s no exact science to it; more like a bit of planning and a little luck. Think of it like trying to get your mixtape into the hands of the right producer \u2013 it\u2019s tough, but if you somehow pull it off, you might just have a shot at the big-time.<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways to try and encourage influential people in your niche to share and amplify your content. Further below, in the Tools section, you\u2019ll also find a software tool that will make influencer marketing a whole lot easier.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Send Influencers Brief Emails<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most straightforward ways to try and get <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">influencers<\/a> to share your content is by emailing them. However, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/10\/time-management-tips\">email is a very real burden<\/a> for many influencers, and as such it might not be suitable for time-sensitive content such as breaking news or industry-first infographics or original data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-too-much-email.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification too much email\" width=\"418\" height=\"279\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth considering that most influencers probably receive dozens, if not hundreds, of such emails every day. If you do decide to email an influencer, don\u2019t be pushy, keep it short, and be polite. Oh, and don\u2019t copy\/paste the same email to everyone \u2013 there are few things more professionally damaging (and embarrassing) as forgetting to change someone\u2019s name in an email. It\u2019s a bad look.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Engage Influencers on Social Media<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This approach can also be highly effective. Tweeting at an influencer to let them know about a new blog post or guide might result in them clicking, reading, and sharing your article. Sure, it\u2019s a long shot, but all it takes is for one key influencer in your niche to share a post for it to potentially go viral, so be sure to regularly engage with influencers in your industry, and not merely in a self-promotional context.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-influencer-marketing-2.jpg\" alt=\"Content amplification influencer marketing\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, when engaging with influencers on social media, it\u2019s important to remember that influencers\u2019 mentions are likely full of links to articles, news stories and the like. By all means be proactive on social media, but don\u2019t overdo it and don\u2019t spam people relentlessly with links to your stuff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use Influencers\u2019 Content as a Starting Point<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to leverage the power of influencer marketing is to use what influencers say as a starting point for a larger discussion. For example, you could use a blog post written by an influencer as either the basis for a post offering a counterargument (a potential use of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">contrarian content<\/a>, if there is a valid counterargument), or as inspiration for a more detailed post.<\/p>\n<p>This type of content is much more likely to pique influencers\u2019 interest, as it responds directly to something that the influencer said. You can then frame this content in a more organic way i.e. \u201cHey, I loved your post about [topic], but I disagreed with some of your points\u201d or something similar.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Strategy #3: Use \u2018Super Remarketing\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Before you ask, no, \u201csuper remarketing\u201d is not a new AdWords or Facebook Ads feature, but rather a content amplification strategy masterminded by WordStream\u2019s own unicorn hunter, Larry Kim.<\/p>\n<p>Super remarketing is essentially using highly granular targeting parameters and combining these parameters with certain behaviors. Let\u2019s see how this works in action.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-facebook-targeting-options.png\" alt=\"Content amplification Facebook targeting options\" width=\"564\" height=\"248\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Say you want to remarket your content more effectively. For the sake of example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re promoting an eBook about enterprise-level IT solutions. You\u2019re already remarketing to everyone who has visited your site \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/01\/remarketing-facts\">the very essence of remarketing<\/a> \u2013 but your conversion rates are still low.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than throwing good money after bad, you rethink your remarketing strategy to cater more exclusively to your ideal customer. You accomplish this by only remarketing to users who share similar characteristics, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works at a Fortune 500 company<\/li>\n<li>Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher educational attainment<\/li>\n<li>Mid\/senior management-level role, or specific job title<\/li>\n<li>Involved in purchasing decisions<\/li>\n<li>Familiar with your brand\/content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-facebook-targeting-options-1.png\" alt=\"Content amplification Facebook targeting options\" width=\"600\" height=\"175\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re new to remarketing (super or otherwise), this approach might seem counterintuitive. Isn\u2019t it better to remarket to wider audience segments in the hope of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">improving conversion rates<\/a>? Not necessarily. It\u2019s pointless remarketing to people who don\u2019t have any influence in the purchasing process, for example, or to people who are still too junior in their careers to make use of the information your content offers.<\/p>\n<p>By being purposefully selective in your targeting parameters, you\u2019re doing everything you can to ensure that your remarketing ads appear to the right people, at the right time, with the right offer. Also, don\u2019t forget that this highly granular approach applies only to your <em>remarketing<\/em> strategy, not your initial PPC or paid social campaigns, so don\u2019t be afraid to delve into the data and be \u201csuper\u201d specific about your remarketing options.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Strategy #4: Get Involved in Niche Communities<\/h3>\n<p>It always makes me laugh seeing \u201cguides\u201d on how to market effectively on community sites like Reddit. Not because it\u2019s impossible to market on Reddit and the like (though such communities are notoriously, vehemently anti-marketing), but because it reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how Reddit and similar sites work.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, Reddit has ads and sponsored links, but its real value isn\u2019t as an ad platform, but rather because it\u2019s a place where people can gather to share their passions, whether that be Libertarian politics or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StartledCats\/\">.gifs of startled cats<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-marketing-on-reddit.png\" alt=\"Content amplification marketing on Reddit\" width=\"800\" height=\"207\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Marketing on Reddit \u2013 it\u2019s not impossible, it\u2019s just <strong>really<\/strong> difficult.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Rather than focusing on \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes and guides telling you how to <em>really<\/em> market on Reddit, focus on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/04\/online-community-management-erica-mcgillivray\">becoming a trusted, valued member<\/a> of the niche communities that are relevant to your business. Don\u2019t just post links to your content every day on Reddit (or <a href=\"https:\/\/inbound.org\/get-started\">Inbound.org<\/a>, or Growth Hackers, or YCombinator, etc.), but instead get involved in the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Remember \u2013 Mick and the lads didn\u2019t become rock gods overnight.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-inbound-dot-org.png\" alt=\"Content amplification inbound.org discussion board\" width=\"843\" height=\"482\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>A typical day\u2019s discussion at Inbound.org<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Post relevant, useful links that people will genuinely find useful. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/13\/google-answer-box\">Answer questions better than anyone else<\/a> and start discussions.

Not only do the folks at Buffer run one of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/05\/marketing-news\">the best blogs in the business<\/a>, they also make an awesome product of the same name trusted by social media managers everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-buffer-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Content amplification Buffer social media app\" width=\"1478\" height=\"588\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via Buffer<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At first glance, Buffer is just another <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/24\/online-marketing-tools\">social media scheduling tool<\/a>. Although scheduling is a crucial part of Buffer\u2019s functionality, there\u2019s way more to it than that. For one, users have the option of scheduling tweets at optimal times depending on the social network in question. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bufferapp.com\/best-time-to-tweet-research\">As Buffer\u2019s own data shows<\/a>, not every social network is similar in terms of when the most people are active at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-buffer-most-popular-time-to-tweet-1.png\" alt=\"Content amplification Buffer most popular times to tweet data\" width=\"639\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via Buffer<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another excellent content amplification feature within Buffer is the ability for users to \u201cre-Buffer\u201d old content from their dashboard. This can be done manually or automatically, but however you choose to do it, being able to quickly and easily <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">share old content again<\/a> is a major boost to any content amplification project.<\/p>\n<p>Buffer is free for individual use, with paid plans ranging from $10 to $399.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Tool #3: Little Bird<\/h3>\n<p>Remember how we talked about influencer marketing earlier? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there was a sleek software tool that made influencer marketing easier? Well, there is, and it\u2019s called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getlittlebird.com\/\">Little Bird<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-little-bird-screenshot.jpeg\" alt=\"Content amplification Little Bird app screenshot\" width=\"640\" height=\"637\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via TechCrunch<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Little Bird is a software tool that makes identifying, connecting with, and sharing content with influencers easy. The software boasts an extensive feature set, including robust social media <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/25\/social-listening-boolean-search\">monitoring<\/a> and graphing tools to help visualize connections between your business and influencers in your industry. It also features content monitoring and sharing tools (similar to those offered by BuzzSumo), making it easy to see what influential people are talking about.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Little Bird has a diverse advertising toolset, including social graph analysis functionality, relationship mapping tools, and contextual connection insights that can drive more effective content advertising and social campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no current pricing information available anywhere on Little Bird\u2019s website. <a href=\"http:\/\/socialmedia.biz\/2013\/05\/08\/little-bird-a-game-changer-for-tracking-influencers\/\">Three years ago<\/a>, Little Bird plans began at $50 for individuals (limited to five reports per month), ranging up to $250 per month for small businesses, $500 for mid-sized businesses, and bespoke pricing plans for enterprise-level clients. These figures may no longer be accurate, so be sure to thoroughly discuss Little Bird\u2019s pricing plans with a company representative before making a commitment.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Amplification Tool #4: BuzzStream<\/h3>\n<p>Many content amplification tools share much of the same functionality, which can make choosing between them a challenge. Fortunately, some tools distinguish themselves by offering functionality that few or no other tools can, which is why <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzstream.com\/\">BuzzStream<\/a> is definitely worth a look.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-amplification-buzzstream.png\" alt=\"Content amplification BuzzStream screenshot\" width=\"696\" height=\"670\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via BuzzStream<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Describing BuzzStream in a few words is pretty difficult. The software boasts a wide range of features, from outreach tracking to team and project management. You can track every stage of your editorial, PR, and outreach workflows, assign stages of projects to specific individuals, and track everything from an intuitive centralized dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>BuzzStream also offers several tools that similar software does not, such as link building and SEO tools. This diversity of functionality combined with the simple, cross-platform project management tools makes BuzzStream a potentially deadly weapon in your content amplification arsenal. BuzzStream plans range from $24 per month for the Starter level, up to $299 per month for the Professional plan. Custom pricing is also available for larger teams.<\/p>\n<h2>One More Time: A Content Amplification TL;DR<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made it this far (and you haven\u2019t been deafened by the sound of all this awesomeness), you\u2019ve learned everything you need to get started with content amplification.
