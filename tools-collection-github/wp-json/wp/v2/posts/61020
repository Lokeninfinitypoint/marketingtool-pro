According to <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/data\/2020-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprout Social<\/a>, the most common reasons people follow brands on social channels are to get access to discounts, to keep up with company news, and to find out about new products or services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-why-consumers-follow-brands-on-social.png\" alt=\"how to find your target audience - reasons consumers follow brands on social media\" width=\"720\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61022\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-why-consumers-follow-brands-on-social.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-why-consumers-follow-brands-on-social-480x250.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t have the same access to your social followers as your customers. If you still want to do an interview, make sure it\u2019s a quick survey with super-specific questions. Otherwise, focus on demographics and behavior. Here are some things to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Career<\/li>\n<li>Household income<\/li>\n<li>Activity level<\/li>\n<li>Other brand followings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, you want to pay special attention to the people engaging more with your social profiles.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that you can use a tool\u2014even a free tool\u2014to analyze this data. Buffer, for example, also offers a free tier.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Dig into your content analytics<\/h3>\n<p>The next existing audience you need to take some time to dig into is your website visitors.

Who is engaging with your videos?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/9353692?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics<\/a> is the natural place to start when you\u2019re looking for this type of information.

Check out your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>You have competitors. Regardless of your product, your offering, and your target audience, you have competition. And you can use them.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at who your competitor is targeting in their marketing. Where are they advertising? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">Facebook<\/a>? Instagram, or Twitter? Who are they addressing in their ads? What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> are they stressing? Analyze their ads, their messaging, and their brand to put together a target audience and see how it compares with yours\u2014including how it overlaps and how it differs. The overlap might help you see, and the difference? That\u2019ll help you better articulate your brand\u2019s differentiation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-monday.png\" alt=\"target audience example - monday google ad targeting marketers on bigger teams\" width=\"600\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61028\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-monday.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-find-your-target-audience-monday-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here, monday.com clearly identifies the difference between its target audience and Trello\u2019s: marketer on bigger teams, in charge of more projects, who get started ASAP.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/20\/target-competitor-audiences-without-search-ads\">audiences your competitors are targeting<\/a>, you want to know which of those audiences is actively engaging with its content. Dive into its social following to similarly identify the overlap and the difference. For a step-by-step process, check out our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/16\/marketing-competitive-analysis\">competitive analysis <\/a>on search and social.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc40 Want an even deeper look at what your competitors are doing?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Set your parameters<\/h3>\n<p>This last step might seem like an outlier in the process, but it is super important: You need to identify who your customer <strong>isn\u2019t<\/strong>. Take the monday.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/26\/competitive-ads\">competitive ad example<\/a> above. The team clearly decided who their audience is\u2014and who their audience isn\u2019t. Their audience isn\u2019t someone looking for a simple, free Kanban solution. (That\u2019s what Trello\u2019s for.)<\/p>\n<p>So for this step, take a look at all of your information\u2014your customer interviews, your social following, your website visitors, and your competition\u2019s comparable audiences. Then identify the gaps that you definitely don\u2019t serve.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you a pet store that doesn\u2019t stock reptile tanks? Your target audience does not include iguana owners.<\/li>\n<li>Are you selling boozy milkshakes? You\u2019re not trying to target anyone under 21, even if that might be hard to tell in your images.<\/li>\n<li>Can you only serve US customers? Then your target audience is not anyone operating outside of those bounds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Setting your parameters will help guide your marketing\u2014and even your business strategy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"profile\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#profile\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Creating your target audience profile<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>After you\u2019ve aggregated all the data about your followers, all the anecdotal information about your customers, and all the details from your competition, the final step is to put it together in a target audience profile.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some information to include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Gender identification<\/li>\n<li>Job title<\/li>\n<li>Industry<\/li>\n<li>Education level<\/li>\n<li>Household income<\/li>\n<li>Interests<\/li>\n<li>Hobbies<\/li>\n<li>Platform usage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your target audience profile will include specifics that are relevant to your brand, too.

Nike is a higher-end brand whose marketing targets influential individuals in society and people up to 55 years old. Under Armour, on the other hand, is not for high-end earners, has a mostly male audience, and targets the 18-25 Gen Z demographic.<\/p>\n<h3>Starbucks target audience<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s compare Starbucks vs Dunkin.
