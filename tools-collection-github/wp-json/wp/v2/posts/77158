It serves as a centralized location to communicate all the necessary details in 1-2 pages.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, a creative brief takes the form of a document, whether it&#8217;s a Google doc or a .pdf file.

Here\u2019s how to write up a successful creative brief\u2014one that leads to better outcomes for your projects and less stress getting there.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-write-a-creative-brief\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to write a creative brief<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to writing your creative brief.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write a project overview<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing you need in a creative brief is an overview of the project to identify what you\u2019re looking for, for what purpose, and how that will be completed and finalized.<\/p>\n<p>Outlining these will avoid scope creep, which is the gradual expansion of a project&#8217;s original deliverables or requirements. If you\u2019ve ever freelanced, you\u2019re probably all too familiar. This happens when a client adds additional tasks, requests additional features, or increases expectations after the project\u2019s already started. Often, all this ends up as uncompensated work.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t only bad for contractors, though. When you increase the scope of the project, it often takes more time to complete and needs more communication to review and approve.<\/p>\n<p>Having a quick, clear overview of the project will help avoid scope creep and time delays so that you can keep on track and meet your goals.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Define the project objectives<\/h3>\n<p>You need objectives for all your marketing activities, and that includes creative campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example creative brief for PayPal below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp\" alt=\"creative brief example from paypal\" width=\"473\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77182\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp 473w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-examples-paypal-237x300.webp 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/aaga8\/paypal-creative-brief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The objective is stated nicely: The point of the campaign is to clear up misunderstandings about what PayPal does and make its offering super clear.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in a perfect world, the specific misconceptions would be written out here. But this is still a good example of an objective for a campaign. What are you trying to do with the creative? Make sure this is what\u2019s communicated to everyone involved in the project.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Share your brand\u2019s key messaging and facts<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to include your main message or messages that you\u2019re trying to communicate with this marketing collateral.<\/p>\n<p>Say you\u2019re working with a freelancer who is writing copy for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/07\/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements\">Google Ads<\/a> about your latest product offering. What\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a> of your product? What\u2019s the tagline? What\u2019s the positioning statement? Share your messaging essentials in your creative brief.<\/p>\n<p>While this is especially important for any creative using copy, it\u2019s still useful guidance for visuals. It never hurts to know how best to communicate with your audience\u2014which brings us to the next element of a successful creative brief.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to include some facts that can be used to guide your project. These could be stats, information about your brand, or insight into your audience.<\/p>\n<p>\u270f\ufe0f Ready to make your marketing messaging more compelling?

Describe your target audience<\/h3>\n<p>Understanding your brand\u2019s target audience is the key to developing compelling creative assets.<\/p>\n<p>So include relevant details about your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>. This will include basic demographic information, like age ranges, gender identities, or occupations. But it should also include more insight into your audience\u2019s connection to your company. Why do they connect with your branding?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience.webp\" alt=\"questions to ask to find your target audience\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your creative partner knows the pain points that your customers experience and what motivates them to buy your solution or service, they can use this to make the designs, content, or media more personal. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized marketing <\/a>is effective.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Summarize your brand guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re working with someone outside of your organization\u2014or even simply outside of the marketing team\u2014you should include guidelines for your brand.<\/p>\n<p>The other relevant brand information for this will depend on the project. For graphics, for example, this will include your colors, themes, logos, and any design rules. For content, this will include your brand voice and tone standards or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">content style guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Masooma Memon, a freelance content marketer who writes the great <a href=\"https:\/\/masooma.substack.com\/p\/letter-51-5-must-use-docs-for-working\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content Workshop <\/a>newsletter, recommends keeping this background short and sweet. Instead of sharing a big document, link to a quick one-pager with big dos and don\u2019ts. No one is going to be able to internalize a thick document for a single freelance project, but they are likely to go through a one-pager to make sure everything\u2019s in order.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Point out your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>In your creative brief, you\u2019ll want to include key competitors. You don\u2019t need to include in-depth <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/21\/competitive-analysis-templates\">competitive analysis<\/a> in your project document. But you do want to include relevant competitor information.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you manage marketing for a doggy daycare and there\u2019s only one other option in town. If you\u2019re looking for new brand visuals, you want to make sure that your colors, style, and overall creative feel are super distinguishable from your major local competitor.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp\" alt=\"creative brief - example of logos from two businesses that look similar\" width=\"766\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp 766w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-competitor-example-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you ended up with logos this close to your competition because you didn\u2019t include it in the creative brief, you\u2019d be in trouble.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. Include any references for inspiration<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with a caveat: Your creative brief should include more information about your business and your products than your competitors. But if you\u2019ve got examples of amazing creative from other companies that you\u2019re looking to for inspiration, include that.<\/p>\n<p>The best examples to use will be from businesses that aren\u2019t your competitors. You never want to copy, but<\/p>\n<p>Take this creative from dog food company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.petfoodprocessing.net\/articles\/16103-stella-and-chewys-launches-first-ever-national-ad-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stella &amp; Chewy<\/a>\u2019s campaign below. This photo could be a great reference visual for photos highlighting dog leashes, pet-friendly hotels, or even hiking shoes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp\" alt=\"how to write a creative brief - inspiration photo example\" width=\"869\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp 869w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-example-inspiration-480x331.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span>8. Spell out the timeline and deliverables<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your creative brief is different from your contract, which you should have as an agreement with any agency or freelancer you\u2019re working with. It\u2019s your contract that will cover payment terms and timelines, as well as other aspects of the agreement such as rights, non-disclosure agreements, and more.<\/p>\n<p>But your creative brief should include an overview of the specific deliverables you\u2019re looking for and the exact deliverables you\u2019re expecting to receive.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for a new logo, you need to specify what file types you\u2019ll need\u2014like .svgs, .pngs, and more\u2014as well as any versions\u2014like black and white, color, reversed, favicon. Those additional logos may not require additional designs, but they do require additional work. Your designer needs to be aware.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp\" alt=\"logo file formats for creative brief\" width=\"936\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/creative-brief-logo-file-formats-480x191.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/looka.com\/blog\/logo-file-formats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth confirming the delivery method. Videographers, for instance, might require you to provide a hard drive for physical delivery or specify ahead of time if you need a digital file transfer. If you have a bigger project, those files will be huge. Plus, you\u2019ll need to agree on how many rounds of edits will be included and the turnaround time for these.<\/p>\n<p>So stick a list reviewing the agreed-upon deadlines, the deliverables, and the method of delivery in your creative brief to cover your bases.<\/p>\n<h3>9. State your distribution plan<\/h3>\n<p>Context matters, and it should have a quick spot in your creative brief. Whether you\u2019ve got someone <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing a blog post<\/a> or putting together graphics for a campaign, it\u2019s good for the creator to have an idea of where their project fits in your marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/social-media-sites-popular.webp\" alt=\"popular social media sites\" width=\"678\" height=\"750\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76936\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/social-media-sites-popular.webp 678w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/social-media-sites-popular-480x531.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Social media assets are great examples for considering this. You can use graphics and copy across platforms, but you\u2019ll want to tailor it slightly for the different personalities of each platform. On Facebook groups and family updates are the big draw. Images are secondary on Twitter. Photos are most polished on Instagram. LinkedIn loves a long-winded post.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social media platform<\/a> you\u2019re planning to use for distribution won\u2019t necessarily change the scope of your project. But it will make sure your designer is aware of the types of content you\u2019re competing with for user attention. That\u2019s helpful information.<\/p>\n<div id=\"creative-brief-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>Creative brief examples<\/h2>\n<p>Need some inspiration before you write your own creative brief?
