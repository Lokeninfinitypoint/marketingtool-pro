This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title tag:<\/strong> aka meta title; the title that appears on the SERP<\/li>\n<li><strong>H1 title:<\/strong> title that appears on the page<\/li>\n<li><strong>H2 headings:<\/strong> aim for at least two<\/li>\n<li><strong>URL:<\/strong> keep your URL short and clean as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Naturally in the body:<\/strong> and also in the first 100 words<\/li>\n<li><strong>Meta description:<\/strong> the blurb that appears below the title tag\/meta title. Make sure it accurately sums up your page and gives searchers a reason to click. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/35624?visit_id=636880082951453933-4272044119&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google doesn&#8217;t always use the meta description<\/a> you provide, but it&#8217;s still important to include.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ranking-factors-keyword-placement.webp\" alt=\"google ranking factors - example of keyword placement for on-page seo\" width=\"971\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82930 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ranking-factors-keyword-placement.webp 971w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ranking-factors-keyword-placement-480x346.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 971px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Keywords in the title tags are, by far, the most important, followed by H2s and URL.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Image optimization<\/h3>\n<p>This is an important one\u2014not only because of Google image search but also because regular search results are getting more and more visual\u2014especially on mobile. Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">optimize your images for SEO<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assign alt text:<\/strong> This is the text alternative of an image, and the only way that Google can &#8220;see&#8221; them. Be short but descriptive and include the keyword. This also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/15\/website-accessibility\">makes your website accessible<\/a> to visually-impaired readers who rely on screen readers to browse the internet, and will show if the image fails to load.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compress and resize:<\/strong> Use an image compressor (<a href=\"https:\/\/tinypng.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tinypng<\/a> is my favorite) to keep your image file sizes to 70-100KB or less if you can. Often, saving as JPG instead of PNG helps. Also, images rarely need to be more than 1,000px wide. Though a responsive website will resize the images automatically, the less requests your site needs to make to the server, the better for page speed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add value:\u00a0<\/strong>If you can, avoid using empty stock images and graphics in your blog posts and instead use screenshots, examples, charts, and illustrations that depict concepts. This improves the quality of the content and keeps users engaged longer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include the keyword:\u00a0<\/strong>Not just in the alt text, but the file name. And replace spaces with dashes in the file name, otherwise your CMS will replace them with &#8220;%20&#8221; which creates an untrustworthy-looking image link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-image-optimization-alt-text.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - a properly saved, tagged, and compressed image in wordpress\" width=\"720\" height=\"482\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63698\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-image-optimization-alt-text.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-image-optimization-alt-text-480x321.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A properly saved, tagged, sized, and compressed image.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"urlstructure\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Niche expertise<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the quality of your content that indicates expertise in your niche, but also the quantity of that quality content. For example, WordStream has been publishing high-quality content about PPC for a long time now, so Google has come to see us as a trusted source in this niche. But if we were to publish a super high-quality post about, say, robotic process automation, our chances of ranking for that keyword are slim.<\/p>\n<p>To build out your niche expertise, you can use the hub and spoke method (also known as pillar page and cluster content). With this method, you create a hub\/pillar page on a particular topic, usually a broad, high-volume keyword. This serves as the main resource for that topic, and your various H2s cover different child keywords within that topic.<\/p>\n<p>Then you have your spokes, or cluster content, which are the additional pages that dive deeper into each of the aspects (child keywords) covered in the pillar page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-hub-spoke-pillar-page-e1716223125870.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - hub and spoke content clusters\" width=\"600\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63699 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-hub-spoke-pillar-page-e1716223125870-600x551.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-hub-spoke-pillar-page-e1716223125870-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to demonstrating your expertise within this niche, this method also helps with your site structure, which we&#8217;ll talk about later. Since the cluster pages link to and from the pillar content, as well as to each other, this keeps all of your links tightly organized around the same topic.<\/p>\n<p>\u2705 Is your site optimized to rank on Google? <strong>Get an instant SEO audit<\/strong> with our <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free website grader<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"technical-google-ranking-factors\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Technical Google ranking factors<\/h2>\n<p>Since it involves knowledge of website structure and content management systems, <a href=\"https:\/\/directiveconsulting.com\/institute\/blog\/what-is-technical-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical SEO<\/a> is commonly a joint effort between marketing and development teams. But although this may seem complicated, once your website is in good working order, there\u2019s not a lot of ongoing maintenance required in terms of SEO. Here are the technical strategies for improving your rank:<\/p>\n<h3>5. Page speed<\/h3>\n<p>Users expect a pain-free browsing experience, which is why page speed is an important ranking factor. If your pages take too long to load, your bounce rate will increase and your ranking will decrease. You can check yours with <a href=\"https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTmetrix<\/a> or Google <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-gtmetrix.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - gtmetrix homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-gtmetrix.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-gtmetrix-480x207.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Mobile-friendliness<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/06\/mobile-first-indexing\">Back in 2019, <\/a>Google told us it would be using mobile-first indexing on all new sites. This means that it makes its ranking assessment based on the mobile version of a site rather than the desktop. Then, in 2020 it told us plans for this to be the case for all sites, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/15\/mobile-first-indexing\">and all sites are now subject to mobile-first indexing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, even if the desktop version of your site is flawless, your search engine ranking could take a major hit if it isn&#8217;t optimized for mobile. Most content management systems allow you to make preview and adjustments for mobile\/smaller screens. You can also use Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly?utm_source=support.google.com\/webmasters\/&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=%206352293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile-Friendly Test<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-google-mobile-friendly-test.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - google's mobile friendly test homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"317\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-google-mobile-friendly-test.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-google-mobile-friendly-test-480x211.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to these tests, you should still always preview and test your web pages on an actual mobile device because there are some things that code just can&#8217;t pick up.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Core Web Vitals<\/h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/25\/seo-trends\">SEO trends<\/a> ebb and flow, ranking factors don&#8217;t often change. But in 2021, Google did introduce a new ranking factor\u2014Core Web Vitals\u2014as a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">page experience update<\/a>. Core Web Vitals quantify a person&#8217;s experience on your page, which dictates whether and how they engage with it. They include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LCP<\/strong> (Largest Contentful Paint): how long it takes for the visible elements on a page to load.<\/li>\n<li><strong>FID<\/strong> (First Input Delay): How long it takes for your page to register the first click or tap on the page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>CLS<\/strong> (Cumulative Layout Shift): whether there are unexpected movements or disruptive popups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\"> improve your Core Web Vitals <\/a>with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading<\/a>, code minification, image compression, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120core20web20vitals-1.png\" alt=\"core web vitals\" width=\"1044\" height=\"588\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10096\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120core20web20vitals-1.png 1044w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120core20web20vitals-1-980x552.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120core20web20vitals-1-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1044px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Website architecture<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, search engines work by crawling and indexing different pieces of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">content on your website<\/a>.\u00a0Internal links refer to any hyperlink that points to another page on your same website. The more organized and tightly-knit your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking structure<\/a> is, the more points of access you create to any given page, and the easier it is for search engines (and users) to find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, any given page on your site should be accessible in three clicks or less.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, you must be mindful of what pages you\u2019re linking to each time you create a new page or a new piece of content. <em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/topic-clusters-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It makes it so that search engines can easily understand and index the content. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topic-clusters-for-local-seo\">Topic clusters<\/a> are also beneficial from a user experience perspective. It makes your content easier to navigate and readers will realize that they don\u2019t have to go to multiple sites to find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely that your website already undergoes regular maintenance to check for things like bugs or server errors. For SEO purposes, it\u2019s a good idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">do a technical SEO audit of your site<\/a> every couple of months to check for things such as 404 errors, redirect loops, and broken links.<strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>9. Site security<\/h3>\n<p>Ever wonder what the s stands for in https (as opposed to just plain old http)? Well it stands for secure. And the way you get your site to be an https site rather than an http site is to get an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/09\/what-is-an-ssl-certificate\">SSL (secure sockets layer) certificate<\/a>. There are a few different routes to getting an SSL, and the cost depends on the level of security you need as well as your hosting setup. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/cms\/ssl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot, for example offers free SSL<\/a> through its CMS.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"off-page-google-ranking-factors\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Off-page Google ranking factors<\/h2>\n<p>Off-page ranking factors have to do with entities outside of your website, such as social media platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">influencers<\/a>, and other websites, but there is one focal point to any\u00a0off-page SEO strategy:<\/p>\n<h3>10. Backlinks<\/h3>\n<p>Last but most definitely not least, we have backlinks. A backlink is a link to your page that comes from another website. A page with a lot of links pointing back to it indicates to Google that the particular page is providing exceptional value, and is coming from a credible website.\u00a0 But one link from one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">quality domain<\/a> is much better than multiple links from several low-authority websites.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">get backlinks<\/a>? Here are four <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/link-building\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link-building <\/a>strategies.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original, quality content: <\/strong>If your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">content is high-quality<\/a>, unique, and provides value to your audience, it will generate backlinks on its own. Go for the irreplicable content like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/21\/thought-leadership-marketing\">thought leadership content<\/a> and original data-driven pieces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cold outreach: <\/strong>It takes years to build this kind of authority, so you&#8217;ll also want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">build backlinks<\/a> by finding related content and pitching your pieces to the author for a link.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Guest posts:\u00a0<\/strong>Another method for building backlinks is by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/21\/guest-posting-dos-donts\">guest blogging<\/a>. Rather than just asking for a link, offer to write a post for that site. You can include a backlink to your site in the post or in your author bio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The top 10 Google ranking factors [recap]<\/h2>\n<p>With a strong presence in both paid and organic search engine results, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">increase your visibility<\/a>\u2014and no matter what kind of business you run, having visibility on search engines is critical if you want to earn trust, build brand awareness,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\"> increase traffic to your site<\/a>, attract customers, and drive revenue. The top 10 Google Ranking factors include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quality content<\/li>\n<li>Keyword placement<\/li>\n<li>Image optimization<\/li>\n<li>URL structure<\/li>\n<li>Page speed<\/li>\n<li>Mobile-friendliness<\/li>\n<li>Core Web Vitals<\/li>\n<li>Site architecture<\/li>\n<li>Site security<\/li>\n<li>Backlinks<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Just remember, when it comes to real SEO, there\u2019s no such thing as a silver bullet. The most important note to keep in mind is that climbing the search results pages takes time. If you optimize your website for several ranking factors today, it\u2019s not going to magically appear in the number one spot tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>The optimization process requires ongoing effort to keep your site as fresh and relevant for your audience as possible. As long as your website is functional and optimized with your target buyer in mind, you\u2019ll start to see organic growth.<\/p>\n<p>For more opportunities to optimize for Google&#8217;s ranking factors, follow our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">easy 10-step SEO audit,<\/a> or you can use our <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free Website Grader tool<\/a> to do it for you.
