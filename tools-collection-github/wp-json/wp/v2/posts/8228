It\u2019s not only a representation of your brand; it\u2019s a chance to engage your audience and achieve your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to improve your email copywriting and make the most of this <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/18\/marketing-channels\">marketing channel <\/a>for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Set your goal<\/h3>\n<p>How can you tell if your email does well if you don\u2019t set a goal?<\/p>\n<p>That might seem like a trick question, but it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no way to tell if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/is-email-marketing-effective\">email worked<\/a>\u2014or if a copy change\u00a0worked better\u2014if you haven\u2019t decided on what success means.<\/p>\n<p>Every email should have a specific target, whether it\u2019s free trial sign ups, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/06\/irresistible-blog-post-titles\">blog post<\/a> views, content downloads, or demos booked. Having this goal set is the best way to measure whether or not your email was successful.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s also the best way to ensure your email copywriting is all working towards the same goal. Take this automated email that I got from Semrush after signing up for a free trial.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-semrush-email-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting tips semrush email has singular goal\" width=\"2216\" height=\"1354\" \/><\/div>\n<p>All of the copy here is working towards a demo focusing on a specific component of their product. The email subject link is engaging, the copy is casually asking about progress, and there\u2019s some supporting information. Now, I wouldn\u2019t recommend hiding a link in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/21\/email-signature-examples-and-trends\">signature<\/a>, but we\u2019ll talk more about how to improve your CTAs soon.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Edit all email copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>You know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/06\/content-editing\">content editing<\/a> is important. Editing your copywriting\u2014including your email copywriting\u2014is just as important.<\/p>\n<p>Your emails should be written clearly without stray punctuation, grammatical errors, or stilted sentences. But this round of editing should also ensure that all of your emails, well, make sense.<\/p>\n<p>Take this <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">email subject line<\/a> that stood out in my inbox recently.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-dog-walks-subject-line-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting tips subject line about dog walks\" width=\"936\" height=\"234\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As opposed to \u2026\u00a0 those dog walks by yourself? An edit would have caught this needless and, worse, confusing repetition. You don\u2019t want your emails to stand out for mistakes, so make sure to look over all your email <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">copywriting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Be brief\u2014very brief<\/h3>\n<p>Over <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">300 billion emails<\/a> are sent each day. That number is mind-boggling. Until you actually think about it, that is. I get about maybe a dozen emails to my personal inbox each day, at least a few dozen to my work email, and then that\u2019s not even taking into account my promotions tabs that Gmail filters out of view for me anyway.<\/p>\n<p>So if that\u2019s just me, then it completely makes sense that there are literally hundreds of billions of emails sent every day.<\/p>\n<p>The point here? With that many notifications all day long, we know that the shorter, the better. Keep it brief, and get to your point quickly. That\u2019s the best chance at making sure your email copywriting actually gets read.<\/p>\n<p>For help, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/30\/business-email-templates\">copy and paste email templates for small businesses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Stay on brand<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re writing an email, you need to keep in mind that the person opening it on the other end will be interacting with your brand. That interaction should be meaningful, and your brand should be recognizable. That means it should be written in your brand voice, feature your brand colors, and follow your brand guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>For email copywriting, it\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a> that you need to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>If your brand voice is formal and authoritative, your emails should include crisp, professional language. If your brand voice is playful, then fit in a joke or pun. Here\u2019s a great example from Madewell.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-Madewell-pun-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting tips stay on brand like madewell with puns\" width=\"350\" height=\"520\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This \u201cseams\u201d wordplay is a perfectly executed little wink. It feels effortlessly cool and playful, and just a little aloof. Just like Madewell\u2019s brand.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use email preview text<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re working with a lot of constraints for email copywriting\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/40-great-email-subject-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subject lines<\/a> can\u2019t get too long, the body of the email should be short. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to use all of the space available to you, including the email preview text.<\/p>\n<p>This is a snippet of text that appears next to or underneath your email subject line in your inbox view. Most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">email marketing tools<\/a>, including HubSpot and Marketo, let you input this text to take advantage of this space.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to take full advantage of the extra space is to treat it as an extension of your subject line that gets more explicit about the body of the email, answers a question in your subject line, or simply follows up on a thought.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example from Drybar.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-drybar-email-preview-text-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting tips drybar email preview text\" width=\"936\" height=\"32\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The email text preview line finishes the thought expressed in the subject line\u2014and connects it even more explicitly to the offer in the email, which is to go ahead and schedule an appointment to get a blow out.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Get your CTA right<\/h3>\n<p>Your call to action might be the most important copy you write. If your email copywriting is all working toward the same goal, then your CTA is the final push. So it needs to be creative and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">compelling<\/a> to encourage your readers to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips for getting your CTA right:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use active words. <\/strong>Active <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">words<\/a> are more engaging, and you want your reader to stay engaged in your CTA, enough to click and commit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get specific. <\/strong>Skip over-used, vague verbs and meh descriptors in phrases like \u201cSee More\u201d and describe your offer instead. \u201cGenerate Better Leads Now\u201d or \u201cSave 10% Today.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay on brand. <\/strong>Think of your CTA as another chance for you to show off your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a>. That means using words and ideas that are related your brand identity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-cta-on-brand-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting tips air bnb email cta on-brand\" width=\"794\" height=\"934\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>This \u201cExplore More\u201d is a great example of AirBnB staying on brand in their CTA.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. Keep testing<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019ve got your email workflow or your weekly newsletter template set, it\u2019s tempting to say that you\u2019re good on email copywriting. But the thing is, you need to keep testing in order to keep improving.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/25\/copy-testing\">Copy testing<\/a> and A\/B testing are great ways to make sure that your emails are getting better and your copywriting is getting stronger. You can leverage powerful AI tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/campaign-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a> alongside your templates to experiment with different A\/B testing variations.<\/p>\n<p>Start by putting two subject lines to the test, then two CTAs, then email headlines\u2014and then start over from the beginning and keep testing so that you can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">get more opens<\/a>, more reads, and more conversions.<\/p>\n<h2>More email copywriting examples for inspiration<\/h2>\n<p>Now you know what email copywriting is and how to improve, but what does awesome email copywriting look like as a whole? We\u2019re sharing some great <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email examples<\/a> to help out.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Asana: &#8220;Hit Your Next Deadline&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>The subject line of <a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/hit-your-next-deadline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this email<\/a> sets the tone for the rest of the email copywriting: It\u2019s punchy, empowering, and to the point.<\/p>\n<p>With phrases like \u201cnext big deadline\u201d and \u201cadjust as needed,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Asana knows the reality of working on a team these days. Things change, and you need a calendar that\u2019ll change with you.<\/p>\n<p>Asana also takes advantage of the extra space for copy in the first image and puts an active, engaging title on the calendar: \u201cMission to the Moon.\u201d That\u2019s how much Asana believes in your projects\u2014it\u2019s comparing launching your next campaign or product with going to the moon.<\/p>\n<p>And above all?

Awesome job.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-asana-email-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting examples asana email\" width=\"540\" height=\"1178\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Postscript: \u201cYour Postscript Results for March \u201d<\/h3>\n<p>The emoji in the subject line of this <a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/your-postscript-results-for-march-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email example<\/a> s great, but it\u2019s even better here because it\u2019s followed through with the confetti in the background heading of the email.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best things about the email copywriting here is the formatting\u2014there\u2019s bold, italics, and headings that make sure you\u2019re getting all the most important information clearly even if you aren\u2019t reading from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p>But if you are, then you\u2019ll notice the concise, casual language, on-brand data references, and multiple opportunities to interact with Postscript.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, that sign off?

David\u2019s Tea: \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>I love a direct address in the subject line of <a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/you-re-the-best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this email<\/a>, and it works even better for personalized emails like this one from David\u2019s Tea.

The tone overall evokes warm, fuzzy feelings. This doesn\u2019t work for all brands and circumstances, but here, celebrating a long-term customer relationship, it not only works but also feels genuine.<\/p>\n<p>The playful examples help with this, as well. Buying a chipmunk\u2019s weight in tea is adorable, and telling me what kind of tea I\u2019d be based on my purchases is fun.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-copywriting-tips-davids-tea-you27re-the-best-1.png\" alt=\"email copywriting example davids tea\" width=\"468\" height=\"1382\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Improve your CTR with stronger email copywriting<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re using email marketing to reach your audience and build your community, you need to be focusing on your email copywriting.
