And of course you want great rankings in the search engines.<\/p>\n<p>However, your website isn\u2019t the only place on the web where you may be selling your product. If <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/16\/compete-with-amazon-ebay\">you have a product page on Amazon<\/a>, you want it to be found by customers just as you would want your site to show up on the first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\">search engine results page (SERP)<\/a> for your industry keywords.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-seo-guide.png\" alt=\"amazon seo how to\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Failure to do Amazon SEO right, just like with regular SEO, will result in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">less traffic<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">fewer sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital to understand that Amazon\u2019s search algorithm works differently than any Google or Bing algorithm in surfacing results. In a nutshell, there are way fewer ranking signals or factors than with typical SEO, which some say includes as many as <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200 factors<\/a> (though others <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/the-myth-of-googles-200-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dispute this<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>You might think that this makes ranking in Amazon easier, but it\u2019s not that simple. If you\u2019re trying to analyze Amazon SEO from a web-SEO standpoint, you\u2019re going to have a hard time. That\u2019s because Amazon is primarily a buying platform, first and foremost.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>A multi-channel ecommerce strategy is an effective ecommerce strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our free guide to Google Shopping<\/a> and start spreading your brand today!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>An Intro to Amazon\u2019s Search Algorithm<\/h2>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s search algorithm is referred to as A9, just because the company of the same name that handles SEO for the company, which is a subsidiary of Amazon, is named\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.a9.com\/\">A9<\/a>. In its own words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe manage search and advertising technologies that are scalable, highly available, and cross-platform for our parent company, Amazon, and other clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Understand that Amazon, as the world\u2019s biggest ecommerce site, only cares about one thing: its bottom line, and therefore selling as efficiently as possible to its millions of customers.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-a9-algorithm-stats.jpg\" alt=\"amazon a9 algorithm\" width=\"750\" height=\"270\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While people perform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">all kinds of different searches<\/a> on Google, many of which are informational searches, pretty much every Amazon search is transactional. That\u2019s why its algorithm actually comes down to only a couple of things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevance<\/li>\n<li>Performance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you optimize your Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product page<\/a> for these two, crucial ranking factors, you\u2019ll end up converting and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/27\/top-reasons-to-sell-on-amazon-2021\">selling more on the site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Both relevance and performance can be broken down into additional sub-categories, so we\u2019ll look at each one in more detail.<\/p>\n<h2>Relevance-Related Amazon Ranking Factors<\/h2>\n<p>Good news: You\u2019re able to influence these ranking factors directly by the strategic use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/23\/amazon-keyword-research\">relevant keywords<\/a> in the following areas of your Amazon pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Product\u2019s Title<\/h3>\n<p>Probably the most important element of Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a>, as far as relevance is concerned, is the product-title ranking factor. You\u2019ll want to put the most relevant keywords for your product in the title.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-product-name-title-seo.jpg\" alt=\"how to optimize products for amazon seo\" width=\"750\" height=\"319\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The top 3 Amazon results for \u201cmortar and pestle\u201d all have those words in the product name<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips to optimize your Amazon product name:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/30\/ecommerce-brand-bidding\">brand name<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Include a clear description of what your product does<\/li>\n<li>Mention a specific ingredient or essential material<\/li>\n<li>Specify the color of your product<\/li>\n<li>Clarify the size of your product<\/li>\n<li>Make a mention of the quantity of your product (if applicable)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As in the world of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/white-hat-seo\">white hat SEO<\/a>, avoid keyword stuffing in your title, as that will harm your search rankings on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/16\/amazon-alternatives\">Amazon<\/a>. If you keyword-stuff, you run the risk of composing a title that doesn\u2019t read naturally, which can look spammy and have a negative impact on your click-through rate.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Seller Name<\/h3>\n<p>Consider the impact of your seller name on your relevance as a ranking factor. Some marketers have observed that they can get specific products to rank higher in Amazon\u2019s organic search results <em>if<\/em> they include the main keywords for the product within the seller name.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example. If you search Amazon for \u201cAmerican flag ties for men,\u201d the first result comes from a seller called \u201cMan of Men.\u201d The word \u201cmen\u201d in the seller name could very well be helping them out with that ranking. (If you remove \u201cfor men\u201d from the search query, you get different results.)<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-seo-seller-name-relevance.jpg\" alt=\"amazon seller name seo\" width=\"906\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So pay attention to your seller name to eke out more gains in Amazon\u2019s SERPs.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Amazon Backend Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Backend keywords are essentially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerlift.com\/amazon-backend-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201chidden\u201d keywords<\/a> that will only be used in your Amazon Seller Account\u2019s backend section. Their function is to tell Amazon\u2019s algorithm that a specific product listing is targeting a specific keyword on the site.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for an analogy to search engine SEO here, think of these backend keywords like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">meta tags<\/a> that tell Google what your webpage is about, which helps the search engine figure out when to show the page to people searching for specific information.<\/p>\n<p>There are five fields sellers can fill out with their backend keywords. Each line has a 50-character limit. If you go over the limit, your backend keyword won\u2019t be indexed by the site.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five rules to keep in mind to successfully fill out your Amazon backend keyword fields:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t repeat any words<\/li>\n<li>Avoid quotation marks since they\u2019ll limit your overall character count<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t include too many variations of the same word<\/li>\n<li>Commas are ignored<\/li>\n<li>Include variations in spelling or synonyms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Your Brand Field<\/h3>\n<p>A product\u2019s brand field always shows up on the product page (right above the title or headline) and links to various search results for additional products from the same brand. As you list your products, be meticulous about spelling your brand name exactly right.<\/p>\n<p>Typical user behavior on Amazon is for shoppers to search for a product based on its brand name, which is why it\u2019s vital to always include an accurate name.<\/p>\n<p>If your product has various brand names that you could conceivably use, get some help from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-tools\">keyword tool<\/a> to help you determine which variation is the most searched for brand name and use that.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Product Description and Bullet Points<\/h3>\n<p>These go hand-in-hand. Both tell your customers more about your product, so this is your chance to be very detailed, as well as persuasive. Of course, you\u2019ll need to include your most important keywords here, too.<\/p>\n<p>For the description, work hard to make the copy readable, natural and convincing from a pure sales standpoint. Follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/05\/product-landing-pages\">ecommerce landing page best practices<\/a>. This will resonate with potential buyers beyond the SEO power you\u2019ll get from including your keywords.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-seo-product-bullet-points.jpg\" alt=\"amazon product page seo\" width=\"1242\" height=\"352\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As for the bullet points, the same applies. Bullet points are easy and quick to read because they\u2019re scannable, so your customers are going to look at this area with priority. Tell your customers about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">the benefits of your product<\/a> (not just the features) and include crucial information like ingredients or dimensions. Work your relevant keywords into these bullet points in a natural way, so as to add value to each tidbit of information about your product. Check out your competition and make sure they\u2019re not including more thorough information than you.<\/p>\n<h2>Performance-Related Amazon Ranking Factors<\/h2>\n<p>Performance factors are a bit harder to directly exert control over because additional considerations beyond keywords come into play. Still, it\u2019s vital that you have an understanding of these, too, for optimized Amazon SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Product\u2019s Price<\/h3>\n<p>It goes without saying (at least it should) that how much you charge for your product significantly impacts your Amazon conversion rate and how many units you move on the site. If your price on Amazon is competitive compared to other sites selling your product or products similar to yours, then your conversion rate should be positively affected.<\/p>\n<p>One aspect of this that\u2019s sometimes overlooked is how your price compares to similar products in the same category on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>If many products in the same category are selling for less than yours, then two things likely will happen:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You won\u2019t sell as many as those similar products<\/li>\n<li>Amazon\u2019s algorithm will prejudge that your product likely won\u2019t sell as many as the others<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Long story short: In either case, <strong>you\u2019ll suffer with a lower Amazon search ranking<\/strong> if you charge too much relative to similar products, so don\u2019t price yourself out of the Amazon market. Carefully compare what your competitors on the site and other sites are doing, and set your price accordingly and competitively.<\/p>\n<p>If your price is higher, there should be a very clear reason why (such as more and better reviews).<\/p>\n<h3>Your Amazon Conversion Rate<\/h3>\n<p>Intimately linked with price, your product\u2019s conversion rate is another highly significant performance factor in your search ranking. Unfortunately, it\u2019s going to be challenging to learn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">how your conversion rate compares<\/a> with much certainty, as you don\u2019t really have access to Amazon\u2019s analytics in the same way you would with analytics on your own ecommerce site.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-business-reports-unit-session-percentage.jpg\" alt=\"unit session percentage amazon conversion rate\" width=\"610\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The best you can do for conversion data is to check Seller Central\u2019s Detail Sales Page and Traffic under Business Reports and Reports. Here, you\u2019ll want to look at the Unit Session Percentage, which is essentially the number of units that are bought per visit. It\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll get to a pure conversion rate for your product page.<\/p>\n<p>If the conversion rate is unspectacular and you believe your product should do better, then it\u2019s time to revisit some of the aforementioned relevance factors to see if you can appear higher in Amazon searches and\/or persuade more people to buy with better product page copy.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Product Images<\/h3>\n<p>Products that feature high-quality images <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxl.com\/blog\/how-images-can-boost-your-conversion-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistently have a higher conversion rate<\/a>, studies show. The same principle applies to your Amazon product page.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-seo-product-images.jpg\" alt=\"seo for amazon product images\" width=\"830\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Amazon itself recommends bigger images in its <a href=\"https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.ca\/gp\/help\/external\/16881?ref=efph_16881_cont_200220550&amp;language=en_CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seller Central Product Image Guidelines<\/a>, writing:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cImages should be 1,000 pixels or larger in either height or width. This minimum size requirement enables the zoom function on the website. Zoom has been proven to enhance sales. The smallest your file can be is 500 pixels on its longest side.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/01\/high-converting-landing-page-images\">high-quality images<\/a> that follow these guidelines, and help ensure that your product listings aren\u2019t relegated to the end of the search results, which makes conversion rates suffer. And when your conversion rates increase due to these optimizations, your Amazon search-results rankings should do better.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Amazon Reviews<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s safe to say that online reviews\u2014which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/learn\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85% of customers trust as much as personal recommendations<\/a>\u2014are another performance-related factor that figures into Amazon\u2019s algorithm. Notice the correlation in Amazon\u2019s search results and products with many reviews. The products that rank at the top for a broader keyword generally have more reviews, and higher reviews, than those lower down on the list.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-get-amazon-reviews-1.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"275\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From this, we can conclude that having more reviews has an impact on click-through rates and can lead to more sales, which in turn has an impact on overall product ranking on the site. Of course, Amazon has in recent times <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/10\/27\/amazon-lawsuit-fake-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cracked down on fake reviews<\/a> to ensure better integrity, so don\u2019t try to cheat the algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to get more of your customers to leave reviews on your Amazon product page, simply send them follow-up reminder emails after a purchase, asking them to leave a review for what they just bought from you.<\/p>\n<p>If your Amazon reviews are negative, take a look at what people are complaining about and work to address the problems with your product. Here are some more tips on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/10\/amazon-reviews\">getting more and better Amazon reviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Eyes on the &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Choice&#8221; Prize<\/h2>\n<p>Successful Amazon SEO comes down to knowing what Amazon\u2019s algorithm wants from you as the seller, which ultimately comes down to making Amazon&#8217;s customers happy. Your product page can be optimized in various ways, but they all come down to two main factors: relevance and performance.<\/p>\n<p>If you optimize with these big factors in mind, you should eventually see movement in the right direction with regard to your search rankings, conversion rates, and sales.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for help with getting your products into the sponsored results on Amazon, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/11\/amazon-advertising\">WordStream\u2019s guide to Amazon advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SEO isn&#8217;t always about Google!
