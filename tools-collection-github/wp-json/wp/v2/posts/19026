There\u2019s the pitifully low success rate. The hours logged crafting personalized outreach. The potential brand damage from an unrequited link ask.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the problem is leverage. The majority of outreach takes place from a position of weakness. When our success rate is low, we try to compensate with sheer quantity. And if quantity is a fundamental part of your strategy, your outreach can end up looking a lot like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c73a46d-4481-41fd-a152-c33dd022719c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-outreach-links-target-practice.gif\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-outreach-links-target-practice.gif?1s9k2g7UcHXRVAC00ytIfZV6rVvfbcVQ&amp;itok=GwB80DK_ 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-outreach-links-target-practice.gif?Pp3uFUnoEXFO1eV1EHn.0VZh3gLBUdXh&amp;itok=q6d_sQWX 595w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Brand scarring en masse<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Intuition might tell you that Twitter offers little relief in this vein.

You have the added clout of your brand to strengthen your success rate, sure; but you also take on all the responsibility that goes with it\u2014each tweet, highly visible, carries with it the stigma of effort. And there is nothing quite so unsexy as effort.<\/p>\n<p>As a dual fire SEO\/Social Media Specialist here at WordStream, with the keys to both our social accounts and our link building tools, I was in a position to run a unique experiment\u2014just how powerful a link building tool would Twitter make? Would our followers condemn our efforts? Would I be annexed back to the thankless, gif-less terrain of email?<\/p>\n<p>With a goal of scoring 10+ quality links, I entered the Twittersphere, gripped it, and ripped it. Here\u2019s how I fared.<\/p>\n<h2>Methodology: Finding Link Outreach Targets<\/h2>\n<p>Before getting into the results, I should explain how I went about prospecting for link opportunities. My weapon of choice was <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\">Ahrefs<\/a>, a comprehensive SEO tool with tons of firepower.<\/p>\n<p>The method itself wasn\u2019t all that complex. The name of the game was unlinked mentions\u2014the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of the link building game. Basically: who on the web had mentioned WordStream without linking to us? <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/content-explorer\">Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer<\/a> did nicely for this kind of excavating:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c833c25-a0c6-443e-bd0a-3e55db376514\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-ahrefs-content-explorer.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-ahrefs-content-explorer.png?Qok_g7eJpLE7uCzsnxw4qKycNknoMP8T&amp;itok=YnOO2tFJ 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-ahrefs-content-explorer.png?5QIQvuKOIXSzCoaS0s_duFDHgFOoA_p2&amp;itok=x2jb2puD 650w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_1300x1300\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-ahrefs-content-explorer.png?UexXoSlQd24P7ltmHZR9XFAyLZ_sV9Su&amp;itok=Zql_n2tA 1000w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sort for domain rating, highlight unlinked mentions, set a time segment, and saddle up. Unlinked mentions are \u201clow-hanging\u201d because the writer has likely used one of your site\u2019s resources without linking to it. So while you\u2019re not offering the writer data that their post might benefit from, you\u2019re actually offering them something far more in demand:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7c3089d1-1b25-4d9b-80b6-0695878f9edc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-authority.gif\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-authority.gif?tSgTjum2NEJyD_YRxaJ.bAdzf0r4W6DG&amp;itok=Rb8nI1Fq 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-authority.gif?4S.UnvxgLou9cIWqsdaaS4W8qF69j_oW&amp;itok=qKrJG1VV 640w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Authority. You\u2019re policing your unlinked mentions, but you\u2019re being polite about it. Your outreach copy reflects this: you\u2019re expectant, but you\u2019re expectant under the pretense of gratitude. That\u2019s how I did it, anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the 12 methods I used to maximize my link-building success rate.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Include a Link AND an Image in Your Outreach Tweet<\/h2>\n<p>If I was wary of Twitter before my first outreach attempt, I was hooked after it. It was like betting on a football team Week 1, winning, then thinking you have the inside track on that team the rest of the season. Invariably, you don\u2019t. But maybe, false confidence be damned, you\u2019re on to something.<\/p>\n<p>The blog was from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.vwriter.com\/\">vWriter<\/a>. A Domain Authority of 42. Still honing my Twitter outreach copy, I tweeted this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"612d28fc-6670-444f-ad5c-e0d1dae2cf24\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-medium.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-medium.png?wZ22lGJbtLl0KiLGNL92kJCTuHl77Y_P&amp;itok=LgfHhXhx 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-medium.png?VL4RPYR20UUiJRI1WkEWr8p_5vmSFQhP&amp;itok=t0yVOROR 633w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A couple of Twitter\u2019s benefits immediately unveil themselves here. For one, Steve Shaw (the writer of the post) has a little over 1k Twitter followers. He gets, typically, one to two engagements per tweet. I\u2019m willing to bet Steve is far more likely to engage meaningfully with a Twitter mention than he is an email. Especially one with the subject line, \u201cGreat post, Steve; Mind Linking?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In terms of ease of use, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/14\/twitter-statistics\">Twitter has a clear edge<\/a>. Mr. Shaw needed merely to click anywhere on the tweet to access the post, then edit it.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking link outreach isn\u2019t advertising\u2014it is. A link is far more clickable with an image, even if your target audience generated it.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Offer Something in Return (And Listen to Your Targets)<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"af162038-8a85-4332-8767-13436a2f0465\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-response1.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-response1.png?ScQRloIrvCsYKuMsiylxQFlLov0pNUSt&amp;itok=f6QSEAMc 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-response1.png?h5zM2yVpWEumIPM4jDaU9WJkCFj4xe0i&amp;itok=zPh3NPbY 630w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Mr. Shaw was nice enough to not only give me a link, but give me the benefit I\u2019d offer in exchange for a link (a social share from our own account) moving forward.<\/p>\n<p>Laziness is among the few reasons a person would refuse exchanging a link for a social share from an account with a lot of followers. I\u2019d incorporate this offer into my next two tweets.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Mix Outreach in with Organic Tweets<\/h2>\n<p>My excitement with Twitter as a link building tool, and with social shares as an offer, was quickly tempered by my next two (failed) attempts:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"759da73b-86ba-44a4-b424-e078c8c36f07\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-rejections.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-rejections.png?k2gaq1K1P2hK3XIU8FIp_sTXRU2TV6fr&amp;itok=TqJfCdD8 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-rejections.png?fH1C24HLjwQym_nH0zY7k5irZeJI9jH.&amp;itok=i2SB_2mj 574w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>One thing to mention here: so long as you start your tweet \u201cat\u201d someone, it will not show up in your followers\u2019 feeds (unless they follow you <em>and<\/em> the other account). There\u2019s little danger, therefore, in appearing spammy if you conduct a bunch of outreach in a short amount of time. I do recommend keeping it within reason, though, and wedging outreach tweets between organic tweets\u2014the \u201cTweets and Replies\u201d section of your profile houses all your activity, and can be viewed by anybody.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Share the Hell Out of High-Quality Link Acquisitions<\/h2>\n<p>My fourth tweet put me back in the money, and back on pace (about) for what would ultimately be my success rate:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0f0371c0-7f3a-48f2-885a-ead7975d7c0c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-success.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-success.png?VGv2iJMAY7YR5giJJ0R448Yrpx9aXHZJ&amp;itok=9r8p0DgZ 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-success.png?qpnlKdcSBevnpD9grJ4EAVienjwMbp6i&amp;itok=4k0iu-YD 549w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The added bonus of bagging a big fish like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/american-business-success-stories\/\">BigCommerce<\/a>\u2014which has a domain authority of 88\u2014is that when you ultimately share their post, you\u2019re likely to get a fair bit of engagement.

Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Slide into Your Leads\u2019 DMs<\/h2>\n<p>After a Blog Which Shall Not Be Named proved a non-starter (you were busy, I understand), I stumbled back into success with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudways.com\/blog\/online-growth-marketing-tools\/\">Cloudways<\/a>.

The \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome\u201d was a response to our display of gratitude for Cloudways mentioning us in their post. They seemed perfectly alright with leaving things at that, until we hit them with the animated gif (the club of choice in nobody\u2019s outreach golf bag). Once they had us in their DMs, they succinctly moved the discussion to email, where, after assuring a link-for-share exchange, we discussed other potential ways to collaborate. We chose not to move forward, but with the right suitor there could have been ample opportunity for guest posting, social sharing, etc.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Be Meticulous<\/h2>\n<p>The Cloudways exchange had me riding on cloud nine. In cruise control. An unfortunate ghosting by another Blog Which Shall Not Be Named did nothing to dampen the mood. I was still 4 for 8. Then this happened:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1391afc0-20c5-4e19-aa56-91991a9d1064\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-outreach-link-fail.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-outreach-link-fail.png?Rd5a0eUY52tEJdawxkgqeKJGcE0dOixV&amp;itok=j73lxhe4 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-outreach-link-fail.png?Bp.NW9SPaF_Z14w1TtkLlsfU5mjNy9jB&amp;itok=qW0ZOsmL 618w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Mr. Lolk wrote a guest column for Search Engine Journal, and was mentioned (with SEJ) in my outreach tweet. One of the many benefits of building links on Twitter is that you can (attempt to) get the attention of the writer and the website in one succinct message. Unfortunately, before I sent this tweet, I had a lapse in page scanning. Two things to remember when scanning a page for an unlinked mention:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make sure the post hasn\u2019t already linked to you in anchor text <em>other<\/em> than your brand name.<\/h3>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">The 25 Most Expensive Keywords in AdWords<\/a> via WordStream,\u201d for instance, would still show up as an unlinked mention for the content search, \u201cWordStream.\u201d An easy way to get around this is to use a browser plugin like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoquake.com\/index.html\">SEOquake<\/a> to scan a post\u2019s external link profile. If your site doesn\u2019t appear there, you can safely ask for a link.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Make sure the writer of the post either still has a role at the publication, or still has access to the post.<\/h3>\n<p>In this case, Mr. Lolk was never on SEJ\u2019s staff in the first place. But it\u2019s good practice to check out a writer\u2019s Linkedin page, or do a staff search on the website to make sure the above \u201ceffective outreach\u201d criteria are met.<\/p>\n<h2>8.

One small thing: when you\u2019re dealing with 140 characters, there\u2019s no reason to skimp on personalization (i.e., addressing a writer by his first name). Twitter is really the ideal medium for tiny, personal touches.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Go After Outdated Posts with Fervor<\/h2>\n<p>Using our name in the title and not even a courtesy link. For shame, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimizely.com\/\">Optimizely<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_narrow\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c9703419-b492-42f0-b683-640637430772\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-outreach-optimizely.png\" width=\"406\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Kidding. Takeshi Young was nice enough to trade a link for a share, and he is an example of an author whose LinkedIn page required a quick scan before link outreach could safely begin. This blog was written back in 2015, so he very well could have moved on from Optimizely. This acquisition should also be a reminder not to sleep on outdated posts: the older they are, the more <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/what-is-link-equity\">link equity<\/a> they stand to contain.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Live in Your Mentions<\/h2>\n<p>Yet another advantage of leveraging Twitter for link building is that you\u2019re fully immersed in your social community <em>while<\/em> you\u2019re trying to acquire links. So while the theory that higher visibility equals higher potential for brand damage is not invalid, I\u2019d say that, if you\u2019re smart, it\u2019s much more likely something like this happens:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee5872a6-cf22-4641-80ff-122e6442a53f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-outreach-mention.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-outreach-mention.png?LBWyH7cXxNlgmGfUcyGzDJkoYmI_mrDn&amp;itok=uT4o9zJM 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-outreach-mention.png?yI_8e_BjISGFJbWwlOqDg48oywJcwU3L&amp;itok=SgT40Bh7 600w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The more active you are in your social community\u2014the more you live in your mentions, liking and retweeting and commenting\u2014the less likely you are to miss a link opportunity like Mr. Gudema\u2019s, and the <em>more<\/em> likely you are to get mentioned in the future. Louis mentioned that we got \u201cshoutouts\u201d in <a href=\"http:\/\/louisgudema.com\/smbs-can-better-select-marketing-tech-using-bullseye-marketing-framework\/\">his post<\/a>. If that was an attempt at getting us to engage, it\u2019s bait we happily took.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Link-for-Link Exchanges Come with a Bonus Social Share<\/h2>\n<p>Our race to 10 links\u2014and our grand Twitter experiment\u2014came to a close with somewhat of a social bang:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_wide\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"59abbf44-b585-40e5-b171-6a0e43cf571e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-link-building-proofhub.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-proofhub.png?Ey1j0_Hx3rS8QJ1c.6mznDvkSqSeWjnL&amp;itok=dSEi7wuC 308w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/twitter-link-building-proofhub.png?3_IFwsGv3Yxn38lABa3vdBn9WyLm2sMH&amp;itok=LhUK5Vw0 474w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Because this exchange was link-for-link, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.proofhub.com\/\">ProofHub<\/a>\u2019s marketing manager took it on herself to share our updated post on her personal LinkedIn page\u2014a page which has a massive following, and which, consequently, earned our post 38 likes, and thousands of eyeballs.<\/p>\n<h2>Concluding Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>From an efficiency standpoint, this experiment was a success: a 48% success rate is pretty damn good. Building links from posts where our site was <em>not <\/em>mentioned\u2014a process which would have required an offer of, say, a social share <em>and <\/em>a relevant resource\/piece of content\u2014would have obviously presented more difficulty, and reduced the success rate. I ran one such outreach campaign in May, via email. It resulted in a 4% success rate. Ew.<\/p>\n<p>But to say that the results here were watered down because the links targeted were \u201clow-hanging\u201d would, I think, be missing the point.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to forego sheer quantity as a strategy\u2014which, I think, anyone should\u2014building links becomes more about maximizing opportunity. Success rates are painfully low. No opportunity should be wasted to build leverage on your side of the interaction. Combining the power of Twitter with unlinked mentions seems like a good place to start.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tired of low link building success rates?
