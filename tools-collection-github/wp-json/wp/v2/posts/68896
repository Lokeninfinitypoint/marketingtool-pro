Let&#8217;s take a look at why:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Know where to put your investment<\/h3>\n<p>I recently spoke to the founder of a SaaS company who wanted to onboard me as a freelance writer. He knew that 80% of his customers, and therefore his revenue, was acquired through the company blog, so he wanted to increase his investment in content and SEO.<\/p>\n<p>He came to this decision because he could tell how well content marketing had helped his company and that blogging was its most important channel.<\/p>\n<p>And side note, he is not alone:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-organic-search.png\" alt=\"highest ROI channels for digital marketing\" width=\"609\" height=\"531\" class=\"wp-image-69091 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-organic-search.png 609w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-organic-search-480x419.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In other words, the ability to attribute revenue to a specific channel or content type will empower you to spend your money on what matters the most. After all, content marketing doesn\u2019t work for everybody the same way. You may be finding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/27\/blog-post-ideas\">success in blogging<\/a> while your competitors may be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">killing it on social media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When you dig into your data to get your content marketing ROI, you can understand:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What content keeps your audience interested and converting<\/li>\n<li>Where you can cut down on spend<\/li>\n<li>Where you need to change your tactics or strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Secure buy-ins from stakeholders<\/h3>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/benefits-of-content-marketing\">content marketing has many benefits<\/a>, it costs money. From writers\u2019 salaries to tools and other related costs, there are enough expenses to go around.<\/p>\n<p>When stakeholders gather to discuss business updates, it\u2019s hard to convince them to let money keep flowing into content marketing without first proving to them that it\u2019s bringing more money into the business.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that traffic and sessions are important, but they alone can\u2019t keep the business going. Only income can do that.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\ude99 <strong>Speaking of traffic&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide!<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\"><strong>25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>3.

Have the right tracking in place<\/h3>\n<p>To get the most out of calculating your content marketing ROI, you need to be able to attribute returns to specific content types and channels. This requires you, first and foremost, to have the right tracking in place. This means that for all your offers you should be using tactics like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\">Landing pages<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/23\/thank-you-page-examples\">thank you pages<\/a> specific to content and campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>Goals and events in Google Analytics.<\/li>\n<li>UTMs or other tracking parameters so you can analyze performance by source, medium, campaign, and content types.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-utm-builder.png\" alt=\"content marketing roi - utm builder by google\" width=\"600\" height=\"526\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69103 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-utm-builder.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/content-marketing-roi-utm-builder-480x421.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/ga-dev-tools.web.app\/campaign-url-builder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s UTM builder<\/a> to create tracked links.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With these tactics, you can see not only which offers are getting the most conversions, but also which channels or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/27\/blog-post-ideas\">blog posts<\/a> are driving the most traffic to those offers.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Define and value your conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Most businesses have a variety of marketing campaigns where a conversion is not a direct sale. You&#8217;ll want to assign a monetary value to that conversion anyway.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\"> gated content<\/a> download brings you an average of 70 leads per month, and out of these leads, an average of 10 of them become paying customers, you can use that to assign a value to leads generated from that campaign, and even traffic to the landing page. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/10\/how-to-determine-conversion-value\">We have some tips on how to determine conversion values here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to use your sales team and analytics data (such as through Google Analytics and Search Console), but ideally you&#8217;ll use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a> and automation software, combined with tracked links and campaign-specific landing pages to be able to get the most accurate picture of your content performance.<\/p>\n<p>Note that a CRM can also show you the different pieces of content a user interacted with during their buyer journey.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Know your metrics<\/h3>\n<p>In order to assign monetary values to your conversions and get content- and campaign-specific ROI, you need to know what metrics to track. This way you can see if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/28\/content-marketing-advice\">content marketing is on the right course<\/a> and if anything needs optimizing or improvement.

Gather ALL of your costs<\/h3>\n<p>This sounds obvious, but it is where most content marketers get it wrong. There are lots of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/06\/content-marketing-tools\">content marketing tools<\/a> you use that you need to take into account. Consider:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Costs of content production<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the payments that you make to freelance writers.

Two weeks later, they look you up on Google and read more about you before eventually landing on your website again, where they sign up for a free trial.
