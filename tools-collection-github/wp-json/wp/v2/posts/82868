This cost-effective approach and Google Ads&#8217; powerful targeting options, which allow businesses to reach specific demographics, locations, and interests, make it a popular choice for online advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Starting your Google Ads journey is simple\u2013all you need is a Google account, which will give you access to create a Google Ads account through their website or app.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?<\/strong> Get the free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"benefits-of-google-ads-for-startups\"><\/div>\n<h2>Benefits of Google Ads for startups<\/h2>\n<p>Why consider Google Ads for your startup? Here are some of the biggest benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>Cost-effective targeting<\/h3>\n<p>One of the key benefits of Google Ads for startups is that you aren&#8217;t paying for wasted views. When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">set up Google Ads campaigns<\/a>, you&#8217;re defining who will see your ads based on what they search, where they are located, and even their interests. This minimizes spending on advertising to people unlikely to be interested in your product or service.<\/p>\n<h3>Relevance<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads offers granular control over matching your ads to search queries and interests. For example, if your startup sells eco-friendly sneakers, you can ensure your advertisements appear when people search for &#8220;sustainable shoes&#8221; or &#8220;recycled footwear.&#8221; This tailored approach improves ad performance and ultimately your return on investment.<\/p>\n<h3><span>Diverse platforms<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The Google Ads network has a massive reach. Your ads can appear in traditional search results and on various platforms. However, based on my experience with search campaigns, the best conversions come from using just Google Search rather than search partners and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">display networks<\/a>. These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google partner websites with relevant content.<\/li>\n<li>Gmail and other Google-owned properties.<\/li>\n<li>YouTube, both in videos and as display ads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Customization<\/h3>\n<p>Successful advertising speaks to an audience&#8217;s needs and desires. Google Ads lets you refine your messaging by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crafting multiple ad variations.<\/li>\n<li>Employing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ab-testing-examples\">A\/B testing<\/a> to fine-tune what works best.<\/li>\n<li>Taking advantage of dynamic ad options that automatically adjust for different viewers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Performance tracking<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-reports\">Google data<\/a> at your fingertips, you can continually understand how your ads are performing. The dashboard shows you clicks, impressions, costs, and helps determine what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking.webp\" alt=\"google ads dashboard performance tracking\" width=\"850\" height=\"389\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking-480x220.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>What results can you expect from Google Ads?<\/strong> Download our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download\">Google Ads Benchmarks<\/a> to find out!<\/p>\n<h3>Flexibility<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads makes campaign management accessible and adaptable.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s why that&#8217;s critical for startups:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scaling is simple:<\/strong> As your budget grows, your ad campaigns can easily expand with you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pause and pivot:<\/strong> Although frequently stopping and starting your ads is not recommended, you do have the option to do so.

If your CLV is high, you can afford to be more aggressive with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-bid-management\">bidding<\/a> and your budget.<\/p>\n<h4>Business goals<\/h4>\n<p>Are you primarily focused on brand awareness, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website traffic<\/a>, or immediate conversions? Your goals will inform the aggressiveness of your budget.<\/p>\n<h4>Testing period<\/h4>\n<p>Starting with a smaller budget allows you to test, analyze data, and refine your strategy before scaling up.<\/p>\n<h3>Starting point budgeting guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>Since you&#8217;re new, err on the conservative side while experimenting.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum starting budget:<\/strong> Consider $20-$50 per day as a baseline. This gives you enough for a few clicks and initial data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Recommended average range:<\/strong> Most small businesses should allocate between $1,000-10,000 per month for Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjusting budget:<\/strong> Continually monitor your campaign performance and adjust the budget based on results.

With Google Ads, you carefully select the words and phrases that will trigger your ads to appear.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you sell running gear, you&#8217;d want keywords like &#8220;running shoes&#8221; or &#8220;marathon training gear.&#8221; This ensures your ads are seen by people actively searching for your products, and not someone looking for information about &#8220;running for office.&#8221;\u00a0 Optimizing your keywords means getting your products in front of the people most likely to buy them.<\/p>\n<h3>Target the right location<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/17\/google-ads-location-targeting\">Location-based targeting<\/a> is great for both broad and local startups. For a global startup, you can segment campaigns according to regions where your product is a fit. For a local startup, it&#8217;s about getting those ads in front of your nearest potential customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting\" width=\"857\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting.webp 857w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting-480x232.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Find the right geographic targeting strategy for your specific startup to make sure your ads are showing to those most likely to become your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Write attention-grabbing headlines and detailed ad descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score<\/a> evaluates the overall quality of your ads, and a major factor in that score is ad relevance. Clear headlines and descriptions that match the user\u2019s search intent can improve your click-through rate, which impacts Quality Score and ad relevance.<\/p>\n<h4>Tips for strong headlines<\/h4>\n<p>Your headline is the first thing potential customers see.

Maximize the descriptive text to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expand on your offer:<\/strong> Elaborate on what the headline promises.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include your unique selling position:<\/strong> What makes you different from competitors? Showcase that here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add strong calls to action:<\/strong> Use clear statements like &#8220;Shop Now,&#8221; &#8220;Learn More,&#8221; or &#8220;Sign Up Today.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Maximizing headlines and descriptions<\/h4>\n<p>Here are some tips for both headlines and ad descriptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay attention to maximum length:<\/strong> Use all available character limits. Google Ads has specific limits for headlines and descriptions\u2013take full advantage of those to provide more information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrate keywords:<\/strong> Carefully and naturally work your target keywords into your headlines and descriptions.
