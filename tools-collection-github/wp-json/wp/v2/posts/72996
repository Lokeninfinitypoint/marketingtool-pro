But it shouldn\u2019t be the only resource you rely on when it comes to learning about your customers.

Michael Santoro, founder of online branding firm<a href=\"http:\/\/brandvelocity.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Brand Velocity<\/a>, who said users must follow a process much like optimizing for search results.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat&#8217;s important is to instruct ChatGPT to produce the content in the correct voice and writing style based on the brand and messaging,\u201d he added. \u201cMany new ChatGPT users just request this type of information with, for example, \u2018Write a social media post about ____________.\u2019 While the content may be accurate, it may not align with how you want your brand to be perceived in the marketplace.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Be aware of challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Another important takeaway is to adopt ideas from ChatGPT\u2014but not copy and paste them.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because ChatGPT may provide the same information to other users, which could result in plagiarism or copyright issues, Santoro said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, users must always double-check ChatCPT-generated facts with reliable sources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s important to note ChatGPT is still a machine learning model, so human oversight and editing are still crucial to ensure the generated content is accurate, appropriate, and consistent with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand&#8217;s voice and values<\/a>,\u201d C\u00e9spedes said.<\/p>\n<p>Or, as Vladislav Podolyako, CEO of email platform<a href=\"http:\/\/folderly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Folderly<\/a>, put it, there are no guarantees ChatGPT-generated answers do not include factual errors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s not a problem when you ask what cake recipe tastes better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the issue becomes critical when one of the recipes contains rat poison instead of sugar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That means websites with proven information users can trust will be rewarded by search engines.<\/p>\n<h3>Support human writers<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s also the issue of whether ChatGPT will eventually replace human writers.<\/p>\n<p>For her part, Burson said ChatGPT can\u2019t replace the human experience\u2014or human capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The prevailing wisdom, however, seems to be to treat ChatGPT as a companion tool.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile too much automation can weaken the human touch that attracts customers, cleverly incorporating it into an overall marketing strategy stands to pay dividends and distinguish brands from their competition,\u201d said Jason Tan, founder of LinkedIn assistant<a href=\"http:\/\/engage-ai.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Engage AI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarketers have the exciting opportunity to unlock AI&#8217;s potential, but understanding what works best requires striking a balance between utilizing technology and allowing human ingenuity to take centerstage.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"search\"><\/div>\n<h2>How ChatGPT will

content may be penalized<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers who use AI-generated content should be aware it may hurt their rankings as Google can detect this content\u2014and penalize websites accordingly, said Tatevik Baghdasaryan, content marketer with AI firm<a href=\"https:\/\/www.friday.ie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> SuperAnnotate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Luke Glassford, marketing director of consulting firm<a href=\"http:\/\/gambitpartners.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Gambit Partners<\/a>, more or less agreed, noting ChatGPT will result in automated content produced on a massive scale.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow well Google is able to identify and reward real content and discourage the use of AI content over the next year will likely shape the future of the web,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>If the search giant is not able to stem the tide of AI content in SERPs, Glassford expects the quality of content on the Internet will continue to deteriorate.<\/p>\n<h3>Expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness become paramount<\/h3>\n<p>Instead of simply publishing AI-produced content, brands should focus on expert-level niche-specific content that builds trust and authority with Google.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle wants companies to build topical authority in order to rank content,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cTopical authority means producing an extensive amount of content to cover the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/niche-markets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">niche<\/a> and achieve authority.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\"
