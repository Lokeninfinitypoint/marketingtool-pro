When you write articles, put together reports, or record videos, you need to make sure you promote them effectively, too. That means testing out new content distribution strategies whenever you can.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019re sharing 17 content distribution strategies you can try and test this year. But first, let\u2019s go over what counts as content promotion.<\/p>\n<h2>What is content distribution?<\/h2>\n<p>Content distribution, or content promotion, is the process of distributing your blogs, articles, infographics, webinars, and more to reach a wider audience than its initial publication.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a strategy we used as an example. We published a blog post covering the biggest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing-trends-2024\">content marketing trends in 2024<\/a>. The blog is the initial marketing channel for this piece of content, and this initial audience includes website visitors and blog readers. It\u2019s also optimized for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO<\/a>, which encourages ranking on organic search. That\u2019s another channel. Posting about the blog on LinkedIn is\u00a0another channel. That\u2019s coordinated sharing of a single piece of content across <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">multiple channels<\/a>. That\u2019s content promotion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-example-1.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - WordStream LinkedIn post\" width=\"647\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81225 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-example-1.webp 647w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-example-1-480x445.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By sharing or even repurposing your content in multiple ways throughout your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">marketing strategy<\/a>, you can increase its visibility and reach among your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>. This has benefits beyond a single piece of content, including increased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a>, a stronger competitive edge, and even more conversion opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re investing the time, effort, and (often) budget to create high-quality content, you want to make it as beneficial to your business as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 Free guide &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website (Fast!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>17 content distribution strategies to start testing now<\/h2>\n<p>Here are 17 content promotion strategies that will help you distribute your content, reach a wider audience, and build your brand. Whether you\u2019re working to put a content promotion plan together or already have a solid strategy, take a look and see what you can test out this year.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Repurpose in another format<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">Content repurposing<\/a> is the first strategy we&#8217;re sharing because it\u2019s the most fundamental and presents the most opportunity. If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/27\/blog-post-ideas\">blog post<\/a>, turn it into a video for YouTube. If you have a longer video, splice that up into shorter, bite-size clips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">social content<\/a>. If you have a data-packed report, pick out the most compelling headlines to make shareable graphics.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-dropshipping-video-1.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - screenshot of a drop shipping video.\" width=\"936\" height=\"551\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81246 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-dropshipping-video-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-dropshipping-video-1-480x283.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Shopify has two versions of this content: a YouTube video and a blog post that explains<\/em><em>\u00a0drop-shipping.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Creating content takes a lot of time\u2014ideating, researching, developing, editing, finalizing, and launching. That\u2019s why content promotion across as many channels as possible is so important. The best way to create even more possibilities for promoting and sharing your content is by repurposing and repackaging it in another medium.<\/p>\n<p>This extends both the reach and the life of your content. By turning blogs into videos or long-form videos into short clips, you can distribute across <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/22\/cross-channel-marketing\">different channels<\/a> and reach new audiences. When you repackage, it takes less time than creating pieces from scratch, but you\u2019re also creating fresh content, which keeps yours new for longer.<\/p>\n<p>This, of course, has its limits. You don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re repeating yourself constantly to your community. And it\u2019s not always feasible or effective to repurpose a blog into a video or a guide into podcast episodes. That\u2019s what the rest of the strategies here are for.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Brand all of your visuals<\/h3>\n<p>If you ensure that all of the visuals in your whitepapers, articles, or blog posts are branded, you can share those graphics elsewhere. You can share these as eye-catching posts on social media to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-awareness-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase brand awareness<\/a>, use these elements in other pieces to create internal links, and even optimize your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">image SEO<\/a> for organic reach with the graphics alone.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/content-marketing-strategy-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semrush<\/a>. It\u2019s a simple but effective graphic of the elements of a content marketing strategy with the brand\u2019s logo in the corner. It\u2019s also the first result in an image search for content marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-image-1.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - Google image search showing branded visuals.\" width=\"936\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81228 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-image-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-image-1-480x281.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is something you bake into your content creation process. Like the Semrush example above, it doesn\u2019t have to be extensive. Make sure graphics feature your brand colors. Include your logo at the bottom of any charts or tables. Take the time to optimize for SEO, which leads to our next strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Optimize content for SEO<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">Organic search<\/a> is an opportunity for content promotion. If you\u2019re writing a blog post, publishing a report, or even releasing a video series, getting your content on the SERP offers you the chance to reach a wider audience through another channel.<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of this by improving your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO strategy<\/a> this year. Whether it\u2019s spending more time considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a> during your ideation phase or focusing on improving your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local SEO<\/a> site-wide, it\u2019s an opportunity to get your content out there.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Include links in relevant blogs or guides<\/h3>\n<p>Internal linking is important for your SEO, but it\u2019s also a chance to promote your content to interested readers who already trust your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-wedding.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - Description on Etsy.\" width=\"936\" height=\"206\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81229 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-wedding.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-wedding-480x106.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/blog\/black-wedding-theme?ref=blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Etsy<\/em><\/a><em> blog post about using the color black as a wedding theme links to a blog on trending wedding colors. Relevant research for event planning.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But in-context linking is only one way to help promote content with internal links. You can link to high-value content from your company\u2019s educational materials, add call-outs to your blogs, or add clickable links to your whitepapers.

Post on social platforms<\/h3>\n<p>Promoting your content on social media is important. Even if you don\u2019t have a large following, posting can broaden your reach and grow your audience. This could be as simple as writing a quick intro and including a link to your post on X (formerly Twitter) or Threads if you\u2019re on there. You can also use major takeaways to record a quick video for Instagram or create a slideshow with major takeaways on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-Irina-post.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - social media post promoting content.\" width=\"409\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81230 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-Irina-post.webp 409w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-Irina-post-205x300.webp 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of a <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/irinamaltseva_reverse-engineer-the-competitors-strategy-ugcPost-7155897297229250561-PG6k\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>LinkedIn slideshow<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The most important thing is to start sharing and pay attention to the responses. Figure out what works for your brand, your audience, and your typical content production.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Plug content on a podcast<\/h3>\n<p>Podcasts are excellent places for sharing recommendations and plugging content naturally. You\u2019re not dropping a link (except in the show notes), but you can reference <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/21\/thought-leadership-marketing\">thought leadership<\/a>, share data and findings, or use a case study as an example. The spoken medium feels more authentic, and if your content comes up naturally on your brand\u2019s own podcast or during a guest appearance, that\u2019s another great way to promote it.<\/p>\n<p>You can run podcast ads if you\u2019re not running a podcast or looking to take on guest spots. These still offer the same benefits. In fact, in a study by Acast, <a href=\"https:\/\/advertise.acast.com\/news-and-insights\/north-america-podcast-listeners-drive-action-for-advertisers-acast-research-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72%<\/a> of podcast listeners reported that they visit an advertiser\u2019s website after hearing a brand\u2019s spot, and 62% of listeners reported making a purchase after hearing a podcast ad.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Syndicate your blogs<\/h3>\n<p>Some publications syndicate content, meaning they republish blog posts or articles as excerpts or in their entirety. How this works will depend on the publication. Some will automatically republish all of your content, while others ask you to submit it for syndication.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-declutter.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - syndicated blog post.\" width=\"629\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81231 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-declutter.webp 629w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-declutter-480x458.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 629px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>For example, this article in Fast Company includes a \u201crepublished with permission\u201d note.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to find sites that might syndicate your content: In a search engine, enter \u201crepublished with permission,\u201d plus a keyword related to your brand or content. The results are sites that likely syndicate content in your area of expertise.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Share with your email mailing list<\/h3>\n<p>Your subscribers have already indicated an interest in your brand and offering. Send them your content, too. This could be a regular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a> to share links to new releases if you have a full and varied <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">content calendar<\/a>\u00a0or a one-off email if your content creation is slow and steady.<\/p>\n<p>Email is an effective content promotion method. According to the Content Marketing Institute, <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b2b-2023-research-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">69%<\/a> of B2B marketers distribute content through their own newsletters and 67% share content in other emails.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-owned-media.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - bar graph showing sources of traffic.\" width=\"866\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81232 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-owned-media.webp 866w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-owned-media-480x333.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b2b-2023-research-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Use these <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">email marketing templates<\/a> to write better emails faster.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Pitch your content to related newsletters<\/h3>\n<p>You should definitely send emails to your own audience, but that\u2019s not the only way to get your content into <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/monthly-email-newsletter-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newsletters<\/a>. There are many regular newsletters that aggregate industry content or share a variety of links with their audience. Pitch your best content\u2014think high-value articles penned by an industry leader or an annual report with compelling data\u2014to include here.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Share on forums<\/h3>\n<p>Forums like Quora and Reddit are potential channels for your content distribution, too. If you have a free course or helpful guide, you can share that. Look for people asking questions about your topic, then answer with a helpful explanation and the link.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms-1.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - screenshot of an online forum.\" width=\"558\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81233 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms-1.webp 558w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms-1-480x516.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A link to a tool that seems helpful, not purely self-promo.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that no one wants to be spammed. Make sure you\u2019re sharing relevant content and doing so selectively.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Partner with influencers<\/h3>\n<p>If you have the budget to promote your content, try working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencers<\/a> in your industry to get your content in front of more people. Here\u2019s a great example. In the video below, marketing influencer Laurie Wang breaks down the fundamentals of digital marketing. She also shares templates from HubSpot, which is the sponsor of the video.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-video.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - screenshot of a youtube video.\" width=\"936\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81234 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-video.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-video-480x299.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WUniTVTi_Jk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that this influencer has 15,000 subscribers on YouTube. That\u2019s closer to a micro-influencer, which can be more affordable.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Promote with banners, pop-ups, or sidebar CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>Your content promotion doesn\u2019t always need to be focused on reaching a new audience. It can also be a push to engage people who are already visiting your site further, whether they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-sales-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warm leads<\/a> checking out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">cornerstone content<\/a> one more time or new contacts who landed on your top-of-funnel blog post for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>In those cases, you can promote your content to your website visitors through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/22\/popup-examples\">pop-ups<\/a>, banners, and sidebar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a>. The key is to promote high-value, relevant content in a compelling but non-intrusive way. Take a look at the example banner below from audiobook platform <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.libro.fm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Libro.fm<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-impact-report.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - lead gen report.\" width=\"747\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81235 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-impact-report.webp 747w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-impact-report-480x386.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 747px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The black-and-white images with the bright background are eye-catching without being overwhelming.

Credit and tag your sources<\/h3>\n<p>If your content contains references to other people\u2019s work, try <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-tag-someone-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tagging them in your social posts<\/a>, especially on LinkedIn or Instagram. <a href=\"https:\/\/mention.com\/en\/reports\/instagram\/tagging-users\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mention<\/a> found a compelling correlation between tags and engagement for Instagram posts.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-engagement.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion -bar graph showing number of tags and traffic.\" width=\"674\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81236 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-engagement.webp 674w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-engagement-480x427.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 674px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/mention.com\/en\/reports\/instagram\/tagging-users\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>More engagement will help more social media users find your content.

Encourage your employees<\/h3>\n<p>Another channel you can tap to promote your content is your employees. Some companies have formal employee advocacy programs, which incentivize sharing content and more online. But even if you don\u2019t have a formal program yet, you can still encourage your team members to post your high-value content.<\/p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https:\/\/hingemarketing.com\/uploads\/hinge-research-employee-advocacy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a> on employee advocacy programs, Hinge Marketing found that the biggest benefits of these programs include increased visibility and increased inbound traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-employee-advocacy.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - bar graph showing benefits from employee advocacy.\" width=\"653\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81237 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-employee-advocacy.webp 653w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-employee-advocacy-480x441.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 653px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hingemarketing.com\/uploads\/hinge-research-employee-advocacy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The key is to make it easy for employees to share content. So post graphics and messaging in your shared channels, send out emails with links to new content when it\u2019s available, and let people know it\u2019s a good thing to post.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Let your community know<\/h3>\n<p>If your brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/19\/brand-community\">runs a community<\/a>, make sure you\u2019re sharing your content there. Community-led marketing takes a lot of investment to get started and maintain, but once you\u2019ve established a group, it\u2019s incredibly effective. These members are engaged with your brand and with each other. If it\u2019s a community listserv, send a quick email. If it\u2019s a Slack or Discord group, set up a channel for distributing new content.<\/p>\n<p>Pro tip: If you have a community, this is also a great place to get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">ideas for content<\/a>. Check out which threads stay active and which questions keep coming up time and again.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Write a guest blog post<\/h3>\n<p>Writing a guest post can be a good way to distribute your content\u2014as long as you\u2019re approaching it the right way. This works best if you have a big, in-depth piece of content, like a benchmark report or survey. You can focus on one finding to create an original guest post for the publication\u2019s audience, which will hopefully be new to you. And you\u2019ll be able to include any branded graphics there, too.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that, in the <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b2b-2023-research-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content Marketing Institute<\/a>\u2019s annual survey, only half of B2B marketers reported using guest posts as a distribution strategy this year.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - B2B content distribution methods on a bar graph.\" width=\"936\" height=\"584\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81238 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-platforms-480x299.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/b2b-2023-research-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is only a slight decrease from last year, and it could be because guest posts work to promote specific kinds of content\u2014original reports or data. If you have those, identify some target publications and give it a try.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Run paid ads<\/h3>\n<p>Most of the content promotion strategies we\u2019ve talked about here are organic. But if you do have the budget to promote your content, run ads this year.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a LinkedIn ad that I saw at the top of my feed while I was working on this post.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-braze.webp\" alt=\"Content promotion - ad distributing content.\" width=\"487\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81239 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-braze.webp 487w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/content-distribution-wordstream-braze-480x591.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 487px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Braze is a customer engagement platform that offers email marketing, in-app messaging, and more.
