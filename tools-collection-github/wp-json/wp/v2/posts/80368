But this campaign type is also quite a bit different from many others that Google has rolled out in the past. Rather than focusing on one network, like Search or YouTube, Performance Max campaigns can run across nearly all Google-owned properties, meaning your ads could look very different from one place to the next. Additionally, the user\u2019s intent and\/or state of mind could also be very different on each platform. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For these reasons and others, I suggest having a few things checked off a list before rolling out Performance Max campaigns, just to make sure you\u2019re being cautious with your funds and putting yourself in the best position possible to see success:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-brand-exclusions\">Use brand exclusion lists<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-placements\">Control placements with brand suitability<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-ads\">Take advantage of all creative options<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-audience-signals\">Don&#8217;t be shy with audience signals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-conversion-tracking\">Confirm all conversion tracking and set clear goals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-max-lead-quality\">Track lead quality performance<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Google Ads Performance Max campaigns: 6 pre-launch optimizations<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a deeper look at the six <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video\">optimizations<\/a> you should make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">before launching Google Ads Performance Max campaigns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Already running Performance Max campaigns but not sure if they need to be further optimized?

Track lead quality performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>From my own experience as well as that of others I\u2019ve talked to in the industry, Performance Max does really well for direct sales and ecommerce types of campaigns. All of the sale and revenue data is available directly from the platforms and product feeds usually have tons of creative and copy to work with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-lead-quality.jpg\" alt=\"google ads performance max campaigns - screenshot of Google Ads lead quality tips\" width=\"777\" height=\"391\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80372 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-lead-quality.jpg 777w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-lead-quality-480x242.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, that means lead generation campaigns have a harder time.
