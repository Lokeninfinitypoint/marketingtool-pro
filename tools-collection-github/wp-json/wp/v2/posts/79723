We&#8217;ve got loads of rules and standards all over the globe, like Europe&#8217;s GDPR and California&#8217;s CCPA, all aiming to keep your personal info safe and give you more say over how it gets used. With tech and the internet booming, heaps of data are flying around, and while it&#8217;s great for businesses, it&#8217;s also sparked big debates about ethics and the law.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk online ads. They power the internet, making tons of stuff free for us. But here&#8217;s the thing: online ads rely heavily on our data to target us with content we might like. That can be useful, but it also raises questions about our privacy and whether we&#8217;re okay with it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/cookie-banner-example.webp\" alt=\"example of cookie banner on website\" width=\"936\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79727\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/cookie-banner-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/cookie-banner-example-480x280.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cookieyes.com\/blog\/gdpr-cookie-consent-banner-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>User consent is the name of the game here.

Google designed it to keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">changing privacy rules<\/a>. Imagine it as a versatile toolbox for websites, allowing them to tailor how they use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a> and analytics based on your comfort level.<\/p>\n<p>In a world where trust and privacy are paramount, Google&#8217;s consent mode represents a positive step forward. It demonstrates Google&#8217;s commitment to transparency and your control over your online experience.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-google-consent-mode-works\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does Google consent mode work?<\/h2>\n<p>Consent mode helps you inform Google about your users&#8217; choices regarding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world\">cookies<\/a> or app permissions. This, in turn, influences how tags behave on your website or app.<\/p>\n<p>With consent mode, when users interact with your cookie consent banner or widget, it adjusts how Google Analytics, Ads, and other tags work. For instance, if a user clicks on an ad and later takes action, Google receives some information without storing personal data, ensuring privacy. If the user doesn&#8217;t take action, no data is shared, preserving user privacy in online measurement.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simplified diagram to illustrate the process:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/how-google-consent-mode-works.webp\" alt=\"diagram showing how google consent mode works\" width=\"936\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79729\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/how-google-consent-mode-works.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/how-google-consent-mode-works-480x220.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semetis.com\/en\/resources\/articles\/exploring-google-s-consent-mode-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-basic-implementation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-use-google-consent-mode\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why use Google consent mode?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/toppandigital.com\/us\/blog-usa\/what-does-the-end-of-third-party-cookies-mean-for-advertisers\/#:~:text=Audiences%20reject%20cookies&amp;text=One%20study%20found%20that%20only,was%20obstructive%20to%20their%20experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">76%<\/a> of website visitors usually ignore cookie banners.

Here are some things it can help with.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lost conversions modeling: <\/strong>Consent mode can help you estimate and understand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">conversions<\/a> that might be lost due to user consent requirements.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Simplify compliance:<\/strong> It makes complying with privacy regulations simpler, especially if you&#8217;re using Google Analytics alongside other tools.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optional functions:<\/strong> Even if you don&#8217;t require consent for Analytics, consent mode can still help you with optional features like remarketing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/23\/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics\">Google Analytics 4<\/a> (GA4) before consent is obtained.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cookieless mode: <\/strong>If consent is needed for Analytics, consent mode can also prepare your setup for Google Analytics&#8217; cookieless mode.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Future privacy features:<\/strong> It&#8217;s not just a temporary solution. Consent mode is part of Google Analytics&#8217;s future privacy efforts, including upcoming features for measuring user behavior <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/privacy-sandbox\/blog\/cookie-countdown-2023oct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">without relying on cookies<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the near future, GA4 users will also be able to model user behavior that might be affected by the lack of cookie consent.<\/p>\n<div id=\"who-can-enable-google-consent-mode\"><\/div>\n<h2>Who can use Google consent mode?<\/h2>\n<p>You might consider implementing Google consent mode if you fall into any of these categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Ads, SA360, or DV360 users:<\/strong> If you rely on these Google advertising platforms for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes\">tracking conversions<\/a>, consent mode is worth considering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics users:<\/strong> If Google Analytics is your primary tool for tracking conversions, consent mode is for you too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interest in future-proofing:<\/strong> If you want to future-proof your measurement and stay ahead in terms of privacy compliance, consent mode is a smart choice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>EEA + UK region:<\/strong> If your website or online business has a presence in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), it&#8217;s highly recommended to use consent mode.

These are tools that help you manage various tracking and analytics services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have an existing consent banner:<\/strong> Your website either already has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/30\/cookie-consent-banner-examples\">cookie consent banner<\/a> in place or plans to implement one. A consent banner is a pop-up or notice that asks visitors for their consent to use cookies or other tracking technologies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have cookie settings confirmation enabled: <\/strong>You should have a mechanism in place that allows users to confirm their cookie preferences. This typically means providing options for users to select which types of cookies or tracking they agree to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google consent mode can also be used for mobile apps through the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK, not just websites.
