And, as we\u2019ll dive into shortly, it\u2019s not all bad news for business owners and organic search marketers. But the expansion of AI Overviews, which have been impacting search engine results pages (SERPs) for over a year now, is nothing to sneeze at. And with the launch of AI Mode, a more personalized, intuitive, and conversational version of search than anything else Google has created, marketers everywhere need to be informed about what exactly this means for their ability to drive organic traffic from search.<\/p>\n<p>Never fear: we\u2019re here to fill you in.

Google first announced AI Mode on March 5 and has been testing and gathering feedback from a trusted sample of users. On March 24, <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-mode-rolling-out-to-second-batch-of-users-now-453553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they expanded to a second group of users<\/a>. That means that if you don\u2019t currently see the \u201cAI Mode\u201d icon next to your search bar, you still need to manually opt-in. You can do that by going to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?udm=50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Mode site<\/a> and opting into Search Labs&#8211;that will add you to a waitlist or grant you access.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ai-mode-optin-png.webp\" alt=\"google ai mode opt in page\" width=\"1200\" height=\"707\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90542\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ai-mode-optin-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ai-mode-optin-980x577.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ai-mode-optin-480x283.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-does-ai-mode-change-the-current-landscape-of-search\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does AI Mode change the current landscape of search?<\/h2>\n<p>Okay. Now that we have a good handle on <em>what AI Mode is<\/em> and how users will be engaging with it, let\u2019s get to the good stuff. If, like me, you felt a wave of relief when you read that AI Mode was still constrained to test users and to manual opt-ins, I would suggest you think twice before letting that temporary sense of relief turn into complacency. For me, one paragraph from Google\u2019s blog release was particularly telling:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cAI Mode is rooted in our core <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/search.google\/pdf\/google-about-AI-overviews-AI-Mode.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>quality and ranking systems<\/em><\/a><em>, and we\u2019re also using novel approaches with the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities to improve factuality. We aim to show an AI-powered response as much as possible, but in cases where we don\u2019t have high confidence in helpfulness and quality, the response will be a set of web search results.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So here is Google telling us 1) That there\u2019s not much publishers can do to optimize for AI Mode, and 2) That <em>they<\/em> <em>aim to show an AI-powered response as much as possible. <\/em>AI Overviews have increased considerably over the course of the past year, and you can bet that Google is going to continue to lean into AI and will <strong>soon roll out AI Mode to all users<\/strong>. That means that all the ways people have traditionally gotten to your site through search, things like the list below are going to be folded into one interface:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web links<\/li>\n<li>Images<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-knowledge-panel\">Knowledge Graph<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Maps<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-mode-view-on-google-png.webp\" alt=\"ai mode view on google\" width=\"1200\" height=\"671\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-mode-view-on-google-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-mode-view-on-google-980x548.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-mode-view-on-google-480x268.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Naturally, Google anticipated pushback from search marketers who are worried that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\">more AI is going to throttle their traffic<\/a>. Why go to a website when a user can get all the information they need from a chat module? And it\u2019s a valid concern. But Google is basically saying: <em>If you\u2019re producing quality content, don\u2019t worry about it. Keep doing things the right way and you\u2019ll be rewarded.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 <strong>Speaking of AI&#8230; Want to use it the <em>right<\/em> way?<\/strong> Free download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-for-ai-mode\"><\/div>\n<h2>How businesses can optimize for AI Mode<\/h2>\n<p>To a certain extent, Google is right. They make the products, and they bring in the audience, so we\u2019re all just playing the game based on the rules they set. It\u2019s also true that if you spend too much time worrying about how to deal with various updates in search, you risk neglecting the hard work that leads to genuine results: creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">quality content<\/a>. It\u2019s a platitude, but it\u2019s proven true time and again.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s my first tip for how publishers should prepare for AI Mode. Double down on what you\u2019re doing <em>right. <\/em>Bring in credible content creators. Create <em>in-depth<\/em> content that comes from a place of expertise and genuinely solves a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a>. Make sure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals<\/a> and UX are strong, and that you\u2019re generating high-authority links. All these things are going to lead to Google popping <em>your <\/em>link in an AI Overview, rather than your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>That aside, here\u2019s where I think businesses can move the needle in the new landscape of AI:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write content that AI wants to feature<\/h3>\n<p>AI responses prioritize <strong>concise, authoritative, and structured<\/strong> content. That means you should, ideally and when appropriate, try to answer questions directly in the <strong>first 1-2 sentences<\/strong>. <em>Then <\/em>introduce deeper explanations, examples, and links.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that you should become <em>extremely<\/em> well-acquainted with lists and tables. Are you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/06\/irresistible-blog-post-titles\">writing a blog post<\/a> on the exorbitant price of vegetables? Fight that urge to wax poetic, in paragraph form, about what the price of vegetables <em>used to be. <\/em>Instead, do this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices.png\" alt=\"example chart content on vegetable prices\" width=\"518\" height=\"131\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices.png 518w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices-480x121.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 518px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facetious example, but you get the point. Tables and structured content are easier for Google to interpret and relay to users.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Own the next step<\/h3>\n<p>At a certain point, depending on the query, your user is going to <em>have <\/em>to leave the SERP to get the information they need. Your job is to <strong>own the queries and the content that live in that next step<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, it\u2019s going to get a lot easier for users to get straightforward answers from the SERP that they used to get from your website. But things like case studies, deeply opinionated and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/21\/thought-leadership-marketing\">data-backed thought-leadership<\/a>, and deep analysis: these are all areas where you can and should continue to shine.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Strengthen E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authority, Trust)<\/h3>\n<p>We talked about credibility a bit earlier, but we really can\u2019t stress enough how important it is. Google is <strong>only going to show the most <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\"><strong>authoritative, trustworthy sources<\/strong><\/a> in their AI Overviews. Why? Because if they show something not credible or untrue there, they\u2019re liable to be in a world of sh*t.<\/p>\n<p>That means that whenever possible, you should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add credentials, experience, and bylines to content (Google prefers content written by real experts).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/author-bio-example-searchengineland-png.webp\" alt=\"author bio example from search engine land\" width=\"1200\" height=\"446\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/author-bio-example-searchengineland-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/author-bio-example-searchengineland-980x364.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/author-bio-example-searchengineland-480x178.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/llm-tracking\">mentions<\/a> from trusted sites.<\/li>\n<li>Use first-hand data, surveys, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p>Keep it credible, and you\u2019ll give yourself the best chance to show up where it counts.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Optimize for conversational search and follow-ups<\/h3>\n<p>The whole point of AI Mode is to solicit follow-ups. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-seo-in-2024\">we\u2019ve written about at length<\/a>, search is continuing to shift more and more toward conversational, intent-driven content. Rather than be discouraged, you should look at this as an opportunity to show up for more conversational queries than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>Things like schema markup\/structured data, detailed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/24\/faq-page\">FAQ sections<\/a>, and <strong>deliberately targeting related queries that AI Mode suggests<\/strong> are all going to allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">max out your traffic opportunities<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Monitor and adapt to AI traffic changes<\/h3>\n<p>Adapting is the name of the game. As Matthew McConaughey says in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street<\/em> &#8220;Nobody\u2014 and I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Warren Buffett or if you\u2019re Jimmy Buffett\u2014 nobody knows if a stock is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles.\u201d The same is true about AI Mode. People are going to speculate, but nobody really knows what kind of impact this is going to have on search until it\u2019s fully released and we have enough data to make informed decisions.<\/p>\n<p>That last point, the one about making <strong>data-backed and informed decisions<\/strong>, is really important. Make sure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">analytics suite<\/a> is fully humming, and that you\u2019re actively tracking your top keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/ga4-ai-traffic-source-png.webp\" alt=\"ai traffic as a source in ga4\" width=\"401\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90014\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/ga4-ai-traffic-source-png.webp 401w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/ga4-ai-traffic-source-201x300.webp 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can track <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">AI referral traffic<\/a> in GA4.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From there, it\u2019s really as simple as following the cookie crumbs and making intuitive tweaks based on what the SERP is telling you.<\/p>\n<h2>AI Mode is just as much an opportunity as a threat<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m firmly of the mind that any potential negative can be turned into a positive, and it\u2019s no different with search. Every update Google gives us is another opportunity for the people that are paying attention and doing the right things to rise to the top.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the tips we\u2019ve laid out and continue to double down on things that are working, and you can rest assured that you\u2019ll be where you want to be:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write content that AI wants to feature<\/li>\n<li>Own the next
