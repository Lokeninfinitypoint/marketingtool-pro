I ask friends what they\u2019ve bought, if they like it, and\u2014most importantly\u2014if they\u2019d recommend it. If I don\u2019t have luck this way, and it\u2019s a big purchase I\u2019m stuck with (like a couch or mascara) I start looking at reviews online. I want to hear from real people who have used the product.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, I\u2019m a target audience for testimonial advertising. And I\u2019d bet lots of your potential customers are, too.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide to testimonial advertising, we\u2019ll cover:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What testimonial advertising is<\/li>\n<li>How testimonial and endorsements are different<\/li>\n<li>Why testimonial advertising works<\/li>\n<li>Examples of testimonial advertising<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s get to it.<\/p>\n<h2>What is testimonial advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>A testimonial is a statement from a customer about how a product or service has benefitted them and often includes them recommending it. Testimonial advertising uses these authentic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a> in ad copy and creative to build trust in potential customers\u2014making it one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/18\/best-marketing-strategies\">best ways to market your business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Testimonial ads can be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">customer reviews from Google<\/a>, Amazon, or Yelp.<\/li>\n<li>Quotes excerpted from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Consumer-generated content (as simple as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/02\/how-to-repost-on-instagram\">repost on Instagram<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Fully produced videos, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A testimonial ad could even be promoting a positive answer on Quora.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-quora.jpeg\" alt=\"testimonial advertising examples - quora\" width=\"635\" height=\"626\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-quora.jpeg 635w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-quora-480x473.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>They can be one word, a few words, or a full description of how light a sunscreen feels or how quickly an emergency plumber arrived to do excellent work. The main thing to keep in mind is that these positive comments should be sincere, whether they\u2019re unprompted or prompted.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3<strong>Testimonials help you get leads for free. This guide will help you get a lot more:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between testimonials and endorsements?<\/h2>\n<p>The two key differences between testimonials and endorsements are the influence of the customer and the incentive they receive. A testimony from a regular customer might get a gift card or a discount; a celebrity endorsement is going to involve some money.<\/p>\n<p>Where this distinction gets a bit murky is when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">social media influencers<\/a>. These are people who are paid\u2014and paid well\u2014to review products and services for their audience. It\u2019s not always clear when it\u2019s a testimonial ad and when it\u2019s an endorsement, but in most cases it\u2019ll be closer to a testimonial ad. Very few influencers are at quite that level of celebrity\u2014for now at least.<\/p>\n<h2>Why testimonial advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>Testimonial advertising is effective because it changes the speaker of your ads. Instead of your brand, it\u2019s consumers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promoting your product or service<\/a> to other consumers. This makes the recommendation more authentic and more intimate. And that\u2019s more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, BrightLocal found that nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50%<\/a> of consumers trust customer reviews as much as recommendations from friends or family. The value of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word-of-mouth marketing<\/a> is immeasurable, so if half of your potential customers trust your testimonial ads as much as a recommendation from their mom or a rave review from their oldest friend, that\u2019s going to mean great things for your business.<\/p>\n<p>That makes the potential value of testimonial advertising huge. But it doesn\u2019t mean that any customer is going to trust any customer review. BrightLocal also found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\">62%<\/a> of consumers believe they have seen a fake review, so if you\u2019re using a real-life review for your ad, you need to make sure it\u2019s good. The testimonial should be authentic and unique, and the customer should seem like a real person.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bright-local-consumer-review-survey.png\" alt=\"bright local consumer review survey results\" width=\"600\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bright-local-consumer-review-survey.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/bright-local-consumer-review-survey-480x422.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So now that we\u2019re clear on what testimonial advertising is, what it isn\u2019t, and why it\u2019s so effective, let\u2019s get to some examples to get you inspired and ready to create your own.<\/p>\n<h2>Testimonial advertising examples you need to see<\/h2>\n<p>Here are 11 testimonial advertising examples that use customer recommendations in the copy and images to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/13\/persuasive-ads\"> persuade potential buyers<\/a>. These examples come from a variety of platforms\u2014from social media networks to landing pages to print publications.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Alan David Custom\u2014Facebook testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>The benefit of a testimonial ad is that it speaks directly to your potential customers from your existing customers. Take a look at this testimonial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/23\/facebook-ad-examples\">Facebook ad example<\/a> Alan David Custom, a suit business in New York.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-alan-david.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - alan david custom\" width=\"450\" height=\"728\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58140\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-alan-david.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-alan-david-185x300.png 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?id=1194660938027011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The level of detail in this testimonial makes it clear that it\u2019s a real customer who needed a navy suit and received exceptional service and a high-quality product. And more than an A+? That\u2019s excellent.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Glossier\u2014Instagram testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>Glossier has great branding\u2014its design, social, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/04\/landing-page-trends\">landing pages<\/a> are all cohesive and engaging. But so many beauty brands have great branding and subpar products that don\u2019t live up to the promises or the hype. That\u2019s why recommendations from real customers are so important. Glossier knows this.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this Instagram testimonial ad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-glossier.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - glossier\" width=\"450\" height=\"763\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58132\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-glossier.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-glossier-177x300.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CYmHxKWsb0W\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em> <\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple in the brand\u2019s millennial pink with a visualization of an <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online review<\/a> in its brand font. The effect? The testimonial speaks for itself.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Noom\u2014Google testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>In Noom&#8217;s Google Ad below, the description starts with a testimonial: &#8220;This is the only thing that works despite having no time on my hands.&#8221;-Sarah. Now had Noom itself written &#8220;The only solution for people with no time,&#8221; it just wouldn&#8217;t have the same effect.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-noom-google-ad.png\" alt=\"testimonial advertising example with a google ad\" width=\"720\" height=\"263\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-noom-google-ad.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-noom-google-ad-480x175.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Note that you can also add a sitelink extension to your testimonial page, like this ad below:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-extensions-sitelinks.png\" alt=\"testimonial advertising examples - google ads testimonial extension\" width=\"576\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-extensions-sitelinks.png 576w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-extensions-sitelinks-480x153.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 576px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Ana Luisa\u2014Instagram testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>This example pairs really well with the one above. It\u2019s an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/04\/instagram-story-hacks\">Instagram Story<\/a> from jewelry brand Ana Luisa that includes a social media comment praising the product\u2014including the user\u2014and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product photograph<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-analuisany.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - analuisany\" width=\"450\" height=\"974\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58141\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-analuisany.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-analuisany-139x300.png 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Seeing both the product and the real-life comment is a nice way to ensure your audience knows exactly what the testimony recommends. Plus, the story is shoppable (a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/13\/digital-marketing-trends-2022\">2022 digital marketing trend!<\/a>), making it super easy to learn more on a product page or convert right then and there.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Raisedwithwolves\u2014influencer testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>Earlier, we talked about the differences between testimonial ads and celebrity endorsements and how these get confusing with Instagram influencers. Here\u2019s a great example of a testimonial ad from one of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">social media influencers<\/a>, a momfluencer with a relatively small following at 24k. Not quite celebrity status, but a solid following and great business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-onceuponafarm.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - instagram\" width=\"450\" height=\"745\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58138\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-onceuponafarm.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-onceuponafarm-181x300.png 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The image here is, of course, adorable, and the copy includes relevant information about the Once Upon a Farm snacks. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/23\/instagram-captions\">Instagram caption<\/a> does even more. The first-person \u201cI love\u201d is a great personalized addition here\u2014and an excellent testimonial.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Calm\u2014LinkedIn testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>While LinkedIn might not seem like the most exciting ad platform, it has more than <a href=\"https:\/\/news.linkedin.com\/about-us#Statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">800 million users<\/a>, many of whom log in regularly. That\u2019s a lot of people to reach when they\u2019re applying to jobs or working during the day.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Calm\u2019s testimonial ad here is so effective.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-calm.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - calm\" width=\"600\" height=\"573\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58137\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-calm.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-calm-480x458.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The review is anonymous and doesn\u2019t get it into too many details, but it\u2019s the context and the specific audience that makes it work so well. The people seeing this ad are busy and working, and they\u2019re hit with this solution that employers can provide for them. Better yet, it\u2019s an employee\u2014not an HR lead who runs the program\u2014who shares how helpful Calm has been.<\/p>\n<p>I also love the quotation marks here to offset the customer\u2019s testimony. It makes the ad visually interesting, which leads us to our next example.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Relay\u2014LinkedIn testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>Visual appeal is great, but your testimony doesn\u2019t always need to be visusalized. Especially when it\u2019s a review from a respected publication. Here\u2019s a great example of a testimonial ad on LinkedIn from Relay, a communication software.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-relay.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - relay\" width=\"600\" height=\"714\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58142\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-relay.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ad-examples-relay-480x571.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/relaypro_discover-why-senior-care-centers-are-rapidly-activity-6877317998076583936-D__Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The copy is the most important part here\u2014a powerful evaluation from a respected source like Fast Company\u2014and Relay puts it front and center.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Headspace\u2014Display testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>It was unseasonably warm in Boston today, and everyone seemed to be out for a run to take advantage of the sun in February. And they looked so peaceful doing so\u2014something I find aspirational even though I have no intention of heading out for a jog. This testimonial ad from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headspace<\/a> uses bright colors to attract the eye and call your attention to the sneakers and quote about running.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-headspace.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - headpsace\" width=\"600\" height=\"460\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58136\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-headspace.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-headspace-480x368.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The best part is that this customer, Knox, isn\u2019t not recommending running. He\u2019s recommending an app that offers guided meditation\u2014to get you that same peace of mind, whether or not you\u2019re ready for a run.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Spur\u2014Vintage testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>So far, the testimonial ad examples have all been from digital placements. But that doesn\u2019t mean that these ads are new. Far from it.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example below from the 1940s. It features a testimonial and a customer drinking soda\u2014or at least that\u2019s what the presentation suggests. Take a look.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vintage-testimonial-ads-examples.png\" alt=\"vintage testimonial ad exampe\" width=\"408\" height=\"1008\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58131\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vintage-testimonial-ads-examples.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vintage-testimonial-ads-examples-121x300.png 121w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vintage-testimonial-ads-examples-414x1024.png 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/68726298059\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em> <\/em>This testimonial ad is similar to other examples in its simplicity\u2014a customer shares how much they love the product. Plus, I haven\u2019t heard of Spur, but I can tell from this that it\u2019s a Coke alternative with this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/16\/competitive-advertising\">competitive copy<\/a> in this ad.<\/p>\n<h3>10. General Assembly\u2014landing page testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>Landing pages are a great place for testimonial ads because your leads have already indicated their interest in your offering. They\u2019ve clicked through and made it to your page, so you want to outline your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">benefits<\/a>. Using customer testimonials is a great way to highlight those.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from General Assembly\u2019s landing page for their UX Design Immersive.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-quote-headshot.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - headshot with customer quote\" width=\"731\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58133\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-quote-headshot.png 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-quote-headshot-480x142.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/generalassemb.ly\/education\/user-experience-design-immersive\/boston\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This testimony is specific to this customer, Emma, but layoffs and forced career changes are also (unfortunately) common experiences.<\/p>\n<h2>More testimonial advertising examples with video<\/h2>\n<p>All of the examples in the previous section have one thing in common: they\u2019re static images and copy.

Dove\u2014TV commercial testimonial ad example<\/h3>\n<p>TV commercials allow for more time than other videos, and Dove takes advantage of this with multiple testimonials for its antiperspirant.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tv-commercial-testimonial-ad-dove.png\" alt=\"testimonial advertising - testimonial tv commercial by dove\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tv-commercial-testimonial-ad-dove.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tv-commercial-testimonial-ad-dove-480x302.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hPifH6jIN5A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Watch the ad here<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>These testimonials are staged but supposedly not actors. Either way, the effect of having these women try the product on-screen works\u2014it makes it seem like the antiperspirant feels great and works, too.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Secret\u2014TV commercial testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s another TV commercial testimonial for a similar product: Secret deodorant. While Dove takes advantage of the extra time to include more perspectives, Secret uses the time to get deep. The commercial profiles strong women with personal questions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-secret-deodorant.png\" alt=\"testimonial advertising examples - secret deodorant\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-secret-deodorant.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-secret-deodorant-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DMKG1cvUAsU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Watch the video here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now, this isn\u2019t my favorite commercial. But there\u2019s a reason you remember commercials like this, just like there\u2019s a reason Sarah McLaughlin\u2019s \u201cAngel\u201d always makes you tear up thinking of sad, neglected animals. It\u2019s emotion. Keep this in mind for your testimonial ads. If you can encourage an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional response<\/a> from your audience with the copy, the video, or the image in your ad, do so.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Linked Living Homes\u2014Facebook video testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/14\/facebook-video-ad\">Facebook video ads<\/a> give you less time than TV commercials, but that just means you have to get creative. You can use extra-long captions, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">carousel ads<\/a>, collections, or you can use time-lapse, like this example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/video-testimonial-ad-examples-linked-living.png\" alt=\"facebook video testimonial ad example - linked living\" width=\"450\" height=\"638\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/video-testimonial-ad-examples-linked-living.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/video-testimonial-ad-examples-linked-living-212x300.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?id=1474575226232102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>View the video ad here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Linked Living Homes features the testimonial in the caption that praises their \u201cdedication\u201d and then uses time-lapse to show building an accessible modular addition.<\/p>\n<h3>14. V1CE\u2014YouTube testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>If I\u2019m looking for a review of something complicated, I go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/27\/youtube-statistics\">YouTube<\/a>. Recently, I was looking for new business cards and watched tons of YouTube reviews to get a better idea of whether or not reusable ones would work.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example of a YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-testimonial-video\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">testimonial video<\/a> from London-based Afro Is Massive for a V1CE card, a reusable business card (and the one we ended up going with).<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rY2BD8m28Uk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rY2BD8m28Uk\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This testimonial is great because it includes the hiccups\u2014the setup takes longer than expected, the missed attempts of pulling up the contact information. These aren\u2019t necessarily dealbreakers, so knowing to expect this avoids frustration later. Plus, it makes the testimonial more real and V1CE cards more trustworthy.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Go-To\u2014display testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating a testimonial ad for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">Google Display Network<\/a>, you need something that\u2019s eye-catching, quick, and clear. This is my favorite example from Go-To Skincare:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-face-hero.png\" alt=\"testimonial ad example - display ad\" width=\"450\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58147\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-face-hero.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-examples-face-hero-241x300.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This GIF ad rotates tiny testimonials like &#8220;Must-have,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m hooked!&#8221; &#8220;Love it,&#8221;<\/em><br \/>\n<em>&#8220;Can&#8217;t live without it,&#8221; and &#8220;Glowy!&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/pin.it\/1CKVkmS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch it here<\/a>.<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pin.it\/1CKVkmS\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The movement of the text is subtle but grabs your attention, and the flashing testimonials lets the brand convey how many people love their product enough to review and rate it five stars. And those five stars staying static? A nice touch.<\/p>\n<h3>16. ILIA Beauty\u2014Instagram testimonial video<\/h3>\n<p>If you feel like we\u2019ve had a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram ads<\/a> so far, you\u2019re right. The platform is great for seeing what your friends are reading or where they went on vacation, but so much of the content is ads or product placements. And people use the platform that way. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CV5vk28MIzY\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">One in two<\/a> people use Instagram to find new brands, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CWbLh7wsWxK\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">44%<\/a> use Instagram to shop weekly.<\/p>\n<p>That means Instagram testimonials about your product or service would reach people when they\u2019re looking for that information to consider or make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example of a super subtle testimonial ad that works really well on Instagram. Ilia beauty has two women, a mother and a daughter, use their product to do a full (natural-looking) face of makeup.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-example-instagram.png\" alt=\"testimonial advertising example - instagram\" width=\"450\" height=\"830\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58151\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-example-instagram.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-advertising-example-instagram-163x300.png 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/?id=305976981576600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The smiles and the body language here make it clear that these women are having fun, and this video offers a view of how the products go on\u2014how they\u2019re applied, how they feel, and how they look. This is information that people on Instagram are looking for.<\/p>\n<h3>17. SharpSpring\u2014LinkedIn testimonial ad<\/h3>\n<p>This last example of a testimonial ad with video is a little different. It\u2019s a LinkedIn post from SharpSpring, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">growth marketing<\/a> platform. This video has minimal production, and that works really well, especially for LinkedIn. The platform is more professional, and the video looks like a Zoom (and, well, it probably is). In the video, the customer delivers the testimonial themselves, too, making it seem close to an internal customer interview. Take a look.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-cleartail-marketing.png\" alt=\"testimonial ads examples - cleartail marketing\" width=\"600\" height=\"638\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58134\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-cleartail-marketing.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/testimonial-ads-examples-cleartail-marketing-480x510.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/sharpspring_dont-have-a-big-marketing-team-behind-you-activity-6899455702633717760-yUPO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This casual video makes it feel all the more authentic\u2014which makes the recommendation more meaningful. Plus, I love that SharpSpring includes the captions in the video. Most people on LinkedIn watch videos without sound, and this way the testimonial video still works.<\/p>\n<h2>Final takeaways and testimonial advertising tips<\/h2>\n<p>We went through a lot of examples quickly, but hopefully this gives you lots of ideas for your own testimonial ads. Whether you use a picture of an existing review, record a customer trying out your product, or ask for testimonials to create graphics, you can\u2019t go wrong letting your happy, current customers speak for you.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s end with some final tips and takeaways from these examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it real.<\/strong> Don&#8217;t omit parts that aren&#8217;t as positive.\u00a0 As the BrightLocal survey above shows, 45% of people are suspicious of reviews that are over-the-top in their praise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include a face.<\/strong> Include images and video of the customer if possible. This makes them more relatable and more trustworthy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get permission.<\/strong> Make sure your customer is okay with you using their words and face in your ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use them everywhere!<\/strong> On social media, landing pages, your website, and more!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get the inspiration and tips you need to create your most trustworthy, convincing ads yet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":111,"featured_media":58125,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-58123","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-marketing-ideas"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>17 Testimonial Advertising Examples You Can (&amp;
