It shouldn\u2019t just happen by accident.<\/p>\n<p>This is why we need a systematic approach for our optimization efforts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bd0228b9-f78e-43fd-bdb0-c5a3ae81c4fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ladder-of-improvement-technique.png\" alt=\"adwords techniques\" width=\"1159\" height=\"577\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How a Systematic Approach Can Help<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of using a systematic approach is the clarity that we can get from our optimization efforts. We can start to better understand how even small changes, e.g. titles on our ads, affect our results (conversions, sales, etc.). Our tactics and improvements then become reproducible.<\/p>\n<p>Reproducibility is a concept from science that just means that\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reproducibility\">\u201can entire experiment or study [can] be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently\u201d<\/a>. Scientists don\u2019t just hope their experiments work. They need to be able to know why they worked.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f74fb01e-bfe9-4f2a-8047-cab801fd3831\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ladder-of-improvement-gene.jpg\" alt=\"ladder of improvement strategy\" width=\"504\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Being able to reproduce your experiments also means understanding all the factors that could have caused your results. One of the ways to do this is by simply reducing the total number of factors. Changing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">ad title<\/a>, ad description and the landing page at the same time will make it harder to know which of these three changes actually helped.<\/p>\n<p>To help us do this, we can look at a simple technique called <strong>the Ladder of Improvement<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using the Ladder of Improvement in Your AdWords campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>The Ladder of Improvement is a technique that comes from the book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich\/dp\/0761147489\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469569596&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ramit+sethi\"><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich<\/em> by Ramit Sethi<\/a>. In it, he talks about the \u201cLadder of Personal Finance\u201d which provides people with steps, or \u201crungs,\u201d to get their finances in control. The rungs go like this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rung 1: Set up a 401(k) with your employer<\/li>\n<li>Rung 2: Pay off credit card and any other debt.<\/li>\n<li>Rung 3: Open up a Roth IRA.<\/li>\n<li>And so on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This technique gives you two benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps you prioritize where to spend your energy and money<\/li>\n<li>It helps you achieve small wins at each rung<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even if you only get through the first 3 rungs, you\u2019ve still made significant progress towards improving your finances!<\/p>\n<p>Our Ladder of Improvement in AdWords will look similar, in that you move through a progressive series of small steps to optimize your AdWords campaigns. We can start by breaking it down into three core metrics:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Impressions<\/li>\n<li>Click-through rate (CTR)<\/li>\n<li>Landing page conversion rate<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First, let\u2019s enter our current values (last week, last month, etc.) for each metric and industry-specific averages for metrics like CTR and landing page conversion rate. WordStream has <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks?camplink=sidebar\">a great guide on what these averages look like for different industries.<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5c294911-6267-4932-b4a9-07528de90ce9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ladder-of-improvement-industry-metrics.jpg\" alt=\"industry metrics in adwords\" width=\"1000\" height=\"983\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>At any given moment, we could be working to improve any of these metrics. However, some of these metrics are more important than others. For example, you can increase the impressions your ads get but <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/12\/ad-ctr\">if your CTR is low<\/a>, you\u2019re wasting all this traffic (and lowering your Quality Score).<\/p>\n<p>How do you decide what metric to focus on then? We can compare our numbers against industry averages. If your CTR or landing page conversion rate is below industry averages, this is your first priority.<\/p>\n<p>Once you know what metric to prioritize, you can now try different tactics to improve it. While it can be tempting to improve all three metrics at once, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/237583\">you will have much better results if you tackle each one at a time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Improve Impressions Metrics<\/h3>\n<p>Low impressions may be a sign that your keyword bids are too low.

To radically improve your conversion rates, you often need <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">an entirely different offer<\/a> \u2013 something irresistible to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll find more tips on improving conversion rate here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/05\/conversion-rate-metric\">What\u2019s the Most Important CRO Metric?

For this, we can look at \u201cgood enough\u201d numbers.<\/p>\n<h2>When Are Metrics \u201cGood Enough\u201d?<\/h2>\n<p>This idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.adobe.com\/digitalmarketing\/analytics\/close-good-enough-metrics\/\">\u201cgood enough\u201d metrics has been talked about by Michael Halbrook<\/a>, a consultant for Adobe. He talks about his experience in theater and \u201cgood enough\u201d setups:<\/p>\n<p>When I studied and practiced technical theater\u2014lighting, sound, and set design, which was my trade before I got into digital media and marketing, and then measurement\u2014there was a common phrase in the scene shop: \u201cClose enough for theater!\u201d That mantra referred to the fact that on a 40- to 50-foot or wider stage, regardless of the design, you could often be a half inch or an inch off in construction and still be okay when everything fit together on stage for the final production.<\/p>\n<p>Getting your numbers to hit industry averages is a great initial goal. Perhaps you could do <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">even better than just the average<\/a>. This is fine but always have a goal in mind that is \u201cgood enough\u201d for you. Otherwise, you can spend too much time chasing minor improvements while you could be working on major improvements somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>The Ladder of Improvement is just a simple technique that you could consider using. The point is to have something that helps you do two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize where to spend your energy and money<\/li>\n<li>Know when your metrics are \u201cgood enough\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Ruben Ugarte is the founder of Practico Analytics where he helps companies make better decisions using data.
