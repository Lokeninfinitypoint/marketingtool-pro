Our business is Kumbo Digital and our client is Currigate.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with a clear headline<\/h3>\n<p>This should be like a newspaper headline that gives the most important information. A subtitle with supporting details or a customer quote is optional.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Currigate Plugs $12k in Profit Leaks with Kumbo Digital<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>2.

This includes<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer name\/category\/industry<\/li>\n<li>Product\/service used<\/li>\n<li>Results (ideally three stats)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Introduce the client<\/h3>\n<p>Share one to two sentences with your customer&#8217;s name, industry, location, and a highlight.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Currigate is a software service that offers highly customizable subscription packages to banks, brokers, and investors in the mortgage lending market.\u00a0<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>4. State the problem, consequences, &amp; hesitations<\/h3>\n<p>Explain the issue the customer was facing or the goal they were having a hard time reaching\u2014as well as the negative outcomes.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>While this high level of customization is what sets Currigate apart from its competitors, it also requires multiple applications with disparate data and heavy manual work. Account owners were spending so much time manage invoicing, there was little left over to build relationships with clients, stay on top of overages, and upsell. This was leading to leaks in profitability and a weakening of customer service.\u00a0<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Include customer quotes as well as any hesitancies they had with using a product or service like yours.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were getting in our own way,&#8221; said Melanie Grigham, Currigate&#8217;s VP of Operations. &#8220;Our customer relationships were starting to falter, and we knew we had to do something. But the thought of manipulating just one of our data sources\u2014let alone all seven\u2014was scary. There were so many random connections in place and so much confidential information, we couldn&#8217;t risk it all breaking.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>5. Describe the solution<\/h3>\n<p>Share how the customer found your business and why they chose you.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Grigham learned about Kumbo Digital through none other than Google research and decided to get in touch. &#8220;The thought of explaining the whole thing felt daunting, but I was relieved to hear [the rep] finishing my sentences for me!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Include which specific product or service they chose, how it was implemented, and how the customer used it. Stay brief!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>After learning the details of the situation, the Kumbo team proposed a custom solution that would integrate all of the data sources into one dashboard. &#8220;I was hesitant at first, but they showed me a small scale example which helped me to understand a little more about how it would work. I appreciated their patience with me as I took some time to make a decision.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Grigham finally went with it. The dashboard took three weeks to implement and the data migration took just under a day.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>6. Share the results &amp; benefits<\/h3>\n<p>Share how the client used your product\/service, what the results were, and the benefits. Include direct quotes and clear evidence (statistical data, before-and-after images, time-lapse videos, etc.)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>With the new platform, Currigate&#8217;s account managers could access all seven data sources\u2014as well as generate, track, send, and approve invoices\u2014all in one place. Time spent invoicing went from days to hours, freeing up time for them to engage with customers and work toward strategic goals. &#8220;Our staff are less bogged down to the point where they&#8217;re asking to take on more clients\u2014which is unheard of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The redesigned and simplified product catalog (206 product codes instead of 1,024) has also made it easier for them to upsell as well as recommend combinations for specific needs. &#8220;Sometimes our new clients don&#8217;t know what they want, and this is perfect for giving them a starting point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Currigate was able to identify $12,403 worth of overages they wouldn&#8217;t have caught otherwise. &#8220;Now, we can be sure that their customers are being billed appropriately (which is great for us) and receiving the services best fit for their dynamic needs (which is great for them). It&#8217;s a win-win.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>7.

Here are eight tips to write a great case study that prospects will want to read and that will help close deals.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make it as easy as possible for the client<\/h3>\n<p>Just like when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for reviews<\/a>, it&#8217;s important to make the process as clear and easy as possible for the client. When you reach out, ask if you can use their story of achievement as a case study for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Make the details as clear as possible, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The process<\/strong> (20 minute interview, follow up with a draft for their approval).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Where the case study will live<\/strong> (on your website? in PDFs shared by sales reps? etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Their options for the interview<\/strong> (in person, phone\/video call, via email).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Any benefits<\/strong> (exposure on social, for example).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The clearer the picture you paint for them, the more receptive they&#8217;ll be to sharing their time with you.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Include a prominent snapshot with the results<\/h3>\n<p>While a good case study is like a story, you don&#8217;t want to hold out on your reader until the end. You want them to know the results right off the bat, then they can read further to find out how those results were achieved. In the example below, the overall picture is made clear with the title (<em>The Loot Box Uses Ad Factory and Content Marketing to Drive Sales<\/em>) and the three stats below it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-interesting-angle.jpeg\" alt=\"how to write a case study - make results clear\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-interesting-angle.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-interesting-angle-480x319.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/case-study-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Choose an interesting angle<\/h3>\n<p>Apart from kitchen remodeling and website makeovers, it can be hard to make a case study compelling. But there is always room for creativity.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on particularly interesting customers who use your product in a unique way or who have a more extreme situation.<\/li>\n<li>Weave a theme into the story that connects your industry with theirs (this might mean puns).<\/li>\n<li>Hook the reader at the beginning with a teaser about the best result in the study.<\/li>\n<li>Incorporate the client&#8217;s unique personality into the story.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more compelling your angle, the better the story. The better the story, the more engaging your case study will be.

Make them visually appealing (and consistent)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We already know that case studies aren&#8217;t the most exciting reads, so don&#8217;t make it worse by throwing a bunch of text and numbers onto a page. A good case study is skimmable, visual, and organized.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-case-study-canva-template.jpg\" alt=\"example of clean business case study\" width=\"514\" height=\"727\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-case-study-canva-template.jpg 514w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-case-study-canva-template-480x679.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 514px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<em>The case study is clean, organized, and skimmable.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whatever format you go with, use it for all of your case studies. This will not only help you to streamline the process but also make it easier for prospects to digest the information.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Be the supporting character, not the hero<\/h3>\n<p>Your company should always be positioned as a helping hand that helped the <em>real<\/em> hero of the story\u2014your client\u2014overcome their obstacle. There are two reasons this approach is so effective. Firstly, you want your audience to visualize themselves as the protagonist of the case study. This is much more difficult if you won\u2019t stop talking about how great your company or product is. Secondly, adopting a more humble tone can help increase your credibility in the mind of the reader.<br \/>\nNotice for all of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/plus\/customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify case studies<\/a>, the client is the hero of the story.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Allbird&#8217;s omnichannel conversions soared<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Gymshark scaled internationally<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Staples replatformed in half the time<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Bombas saved $108,000 a year<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-shopify.png\" alt=\"how to write a case study - shopify examples\" width=\"720\" height=\"394\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-shopify.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-shopify-480x263.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. Let your clients tell their own story<\/h3>\n<p>As a storyteller, it\u2019s your job to craft a compelling narrative about how your featured client triumphed over the forces of evil using your product or service, but that doesn\u2019t mean your protagonist doesn\u2019t have their own voice.<\/p>\n<p>Let them tell the story in their own words and then incorporate direct quotes into your narrative. This will break up your text, increase credibility, and make your protagonist a tangible character that readers can relate to. Take an interview style format and use paraphrasing and annotations so the text isn&#8217;t repetitive. Set up the segue and create room for your client\u2019s quote, and let them do the rest.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-localiq-example-copy.png\" alt=\"how to write a case study - example of paraphrase and quote\" width=\"619\" height=\"557\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-localiq-example-copy.png 619w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-write-a-case-study-localiq-example-copy-480x432.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 619px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/success-stories\/aubuchon-homes-miloff-aubuchon-realty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>View the full case study example here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8. Have realistic expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, we want to create a useful, helpful resource for prospective customers, but let\u2019s be real\u2014nobody\u2019s winning a Pulitzer for a case study, and it won\u2019t be going viral on social media, no matter how well-written it is.<\/p>\n<p>Case studies are little more than tools to be used by either self-motivated prospects researching your company, or by sales professionals as tools to help convince prospects to convert. Nothing more. They\u2019re designed for audiences that are already strongly considering becoming your customers, which is a smaller but more qualified group of people than your general audience.<\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t be disheartened if your case study content doesn\u2019t attract as much traffic or engagement as your best or even average content. They&#8217;re not meant to. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should stop creating them or start obsessing over how to improve them.<\/p>\n<div id=\"real-case-study-examples\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#real-case-study-examples\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Business case study examples<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here are some business case study examples that put the tips in this guide into play.<\/p>\n<h3>LocaliQ<\/h3>\n<p>Call us biased, but LocaliQ&#8217;s case study format is pretty rad.
