For pay-per-click (PPC) and social media campaigns, businesses monitor CPL to understand whether their marketing efforts (and associated costs) are worth it.<\/p>\n<p>The more expensive it is to acquire a lead, the less gross profit you\u2019ll expect to see in the long run, as lead acquisition costs eat into your earnings. Marketers and advertisers want to find the sweet spot between investing in getting the word out about their company and ensuring those efforts are as efficient as possible in converting new prospects into leads.<\/p>\n<p>So, we put together this complete cost-per-lead guide to help with that.

Take stock of your current performance metrics<\/h3>\n<p>The first step in finding ways to lower CPL is learning where you stand today. Crunch the numbers for each marketing or advertising campaign you have underway. This will allow you to identify any weak spots quickly. Is there a particular campaign that\u2019s quite costly but not generating many leads? It might be time to forgo that pursuit.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, you can ferret out opportunities for improvement. If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/09\/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low-cost marketing tactic<\/a> that generates quite a few leads already, can you optimize it further to attract even more leads?<\/p>\n<p>During this process, you might wonder if your CPL is good. It\u2019s a fair question! Any CPL greater than the cost of your product or service is too high. It can also be helpful to measure yourself against competitors by checking out <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-advertising-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPL benchmarks<\/a> by industry.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp\" alt=\"google ads average cost per click 2024 chart\" width=\"2259\" height=\"2560\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82730\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp 2259w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-1280x1451.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-980x1111.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-480x544.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2259px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve analyzed your campaigns and identified the ones with a noteworthy CPL\u2014good or bad\u2014you may wish to dig into that specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channel<\/a> even further.<\/p>\n<p>You can look at things like CPL across devices (desktop versus mobile) or consider the parts that make up a particular advertising campaign. For example, if a PPC ad has a very poor CPL but a very high click-through rate, that&#8217;s usually an indication of a low <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/landing-page-best-practices\/\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion rate on the landing page<\/a>. It\u2019s worth digging into what\u2019s causing your prospects to leave that page without converting.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Rethink your targeting strategy<\/h3>\n<p>When you run digital ads, a considerable portion of the work behind the scenes is setting your targeting strategy. For search engine marketing, you target certain keywords, while social media platforms allow you to target based on users\u2019 demographic information.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, your targeting strategy can make or break your success. Go too narrow or specific, and you severely limit the number of people who can see your ads. Plus, it can drive up the cost of your ads. But go too broad, and your ads will be served to many people who won\u2019t find your message relevant.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/negative-keyword-examples.webp\" alt=\"negative keyword examples in google ads\" width=\"664\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/negative-keyword-examples.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/negative-keyword-examples-480x434.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Google offers<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2453972?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> examples<\/a> of negative keywords.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You want to find somewhere in the middle that\u2019s just right. With PPC ads, that might mean adding <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2453972?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative keywords<\/a>, which excludes specific search terms from your campaign and helps you target only the most relevant audience.<\/p>\n<p>For social media ads (like those on Meta), it\u2019s about starting broad and refining as you learn more about what\u2019s working. You may even consider creating lookalike audiences, which target Meta users who share attributes with your current customers.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Try A\/B testing<\/h3>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ab-testing-examples\" rel=\"noopener\">A\/B test<\/a> an ad, you run two similar versions of the same concept with a tweak in one area. For example, you might try two headlines on an ad to see which performs better.<\/p>\n<p>This can help you hone in on the messaging that best resonates with your audience, which can drive down cost per lead as you learn to run more efficient, effective ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp\" alt=\"checklist of what to include in a\/b testing hypothesis\" width=\"935\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist-480x268.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some digital advertising platforms even help you automate the process. For example, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/responsive-search-ads\" rel=\"noopener\">responsive search ads<\/a> invite you to input up to 15 headlines and four descriptions for each ad. Google then uses AI to serve up different combinations of your headline and description text to see what performs best.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Meta has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1738164643098669?id=445653312788501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an A\/B testing feature<\/a> that allows you to run different permutations of your ad based on an identified hypothesis.<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of these built-in tools to test different advertising approaches and find the one that gets you the highest response rate among your target audience.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Align keywords with copy<\/h3>\n<p>This one of our seven ways to lower CPL is just as helpful for paid marketing tactics as for organic ones. Whether you\u2019re running PPC ads or drafting your title tags and meta descriptions, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/website-copywriting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aligning your copy<\/a> with your audience&#8217;s search terms is wise.<\/p>\n<p>The example below exemplifies this approach. These furniture companies, ranking in organic spots one through four on the Google results page, don\u2019t use their brand name or location in the title tag. Instead, they all include some variation of the search term \u201csmall space furniture brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp\" alt=\"example of ad with keywords and copy aligned\" width=\"774\" height=\"555\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp 774w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp-480x344.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These brands might not be as familiar to searchers, so instead of competing on name recognition, they lead with their value propositions: \u201cYou live in a small space and need furniture that will fit it? You can see from our title tag that we\u2019re your retailer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When your online presence can draw searchers in with a promise that you offer the solution they need, that\u2019s how you could lower your cost per lead. It increases the likelihood that leads will click through and make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Want help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>5. Strengthen your landing page<\/h3>\n<p>Each ad that you run should drive to a dedicated landing page. You\u2019ve worked to tailor your ad language to suit the keywords you\u2019re targeting perfectly, and your prospect has clicked on your link as a result of that hard work. If they land on your homepage without finding further mention of what they came here for, they can quickly get lost, confused, or distracted.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, hook them in with a customized landing page that continues to address their specific need.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you run an ad to promote an upcoming conference you\u2019re hosting. The landing page should drive to a page about that event, with a click-to-action (CTA) to register.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp\" alt=\"ad example leading to landing page\" width=\"788\" height=\"609\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp 788w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp-480x371.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp\" alt=\"landing page associated with ad\" width=\"739\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp 739w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/lower-cost-per-lead-cta-480x282.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In<a href=\"https:\/\/vtmerch.com\/collections\/vault-2024?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=705817767517&amp;tw_campaign=21474775600&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgClm1m6VlYsBZuU_0ZKCHU39PYJYYmWA_ptZs5lc9xswAt4fRPFqgf3hoC4DEQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> this example<\/a>, the top sponsored result for the search term \u201cconferences for investment professionals\u201d drove to a customized landing page where the CTA invites visitors to \u201csecure [their] seats.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Incorporate a lead capture form<\/h3>\n<p>Once a prospect has made it all the way to your landing page, giving them a clear path to convert is another favorite way to lower CPL.<\/p>\n<p>On a landing page, that means including a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead capture form<\/a>. This is where you invite your prospects to enter their contact information. There are several CTAs you can try to get you there. The one that works for you will depend on your business, but you might try:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join our newsletter<\/li>\n<li>Register for our event<\/li>\n<li>Download our whitepaper or report<\/li>\n<li>Schedule a call<\/li>\n<li>Book a demo<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea. This CTA gives your prospect a reason to want to stay in touch and opens the door for you to continue to connect with them until they\u2019re ready to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Download our free guide to the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">42 best call-to-action phrases<\/a> ever<\/strong> to get ideas for how to attract more low-cost leads!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Make the most of remarketing<\/h3>\n<p>Remarketing allows brands to stay in front of prospects who have visited their website. Maybe you didn\u2019t convert them the first time, but remaining in their field of vision gives you a second chance.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever had a display ad for a product you just viewed follow you across every site you visit for the next few weeks, you\u2019ve experienced remarketing. And if you\u2019ve ever clicked on those ads, you know why they work.<\/p>\n<p>It often takes time for a consumer to get to know, like, and trust a brand. That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/e-commerce-report-shows-returning-customers-are-more-valuable-than-new-ones-2016-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly half<\/a> of all transactions on a website come from returning visitors.<\/p>\n<p>If you follow a new prospect around for a few weeks with your remarketing ads, they may eventually come around. And the numbers on remarketing bear that out: studies show a conversion rate that\u2019s over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.i-com.net\/blog\/remarketing-what-its-all-about-and-does-it-really-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">292%<\/a> higher for retargeted users than it is for new faces.<\/p>\n<div id=\"lower-cost-per-lead\"><\/div>\n<h2>Try these tactics to lower your cost per lead and save on spend<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no wrong answer here! Working systematically through the list and measuring each technique\u2019s impact on your CPL can help you spot the ones most likely to drive desired results.<\/p>\n<p>As your CPL drops, you can also return to the most effective tactics and look for further opportunities to refine your approach.
