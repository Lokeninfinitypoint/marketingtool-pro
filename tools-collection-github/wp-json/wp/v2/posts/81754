However, it can be difficult for small local businesses to compete with national brands that can afford to outspend them on Google Ads. Instead, local businesses need to be smarter and make the most of targeting their local area within Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>But local advertisers have some powerful tools when it comes to advertising online. More than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipx1031.com\/small-business-statistics-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> of consumers would prefer to shop locally\u2013and nearly 60% would even pay more to support a local business! Savvy advertisers can take advantage of this and highlight their local status when customers are searching for their products and services online.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Google Ads and Microsoft Ads have several features that any local business should take advantage of to have their ads stand out in their local searches. So, here are my top three strategies for localizing search ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#local-dynamic-keyword-insertion\">Dynamically insert locations in your Responsive Search Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-location-assets\">Create location assets (and optimize your Google Business Profile)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-assets-for-local-ads\">Take advantage of other local ad assets<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How to localize your Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Here are three ways any business can localize its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/promotions-in-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Looking for other ways to get more out of your local campaigns?

Dynamically insert locations in your Responsive Search Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Of course,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/15\/local-marketing-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> localizing your ad copy<\/a> for each city, town, or state you serve is a clear and effective way to show your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">business is local<\/a> to your searchers. But, manually creating hundreds of ads for every town where people might search for your services will quickly get time-consuming. Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-search-partner-insights\">targeting<\/a> each one in its own campaign? A nightmare in the making for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">account structure<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - example of google ads for different cities\" width=\"642\" height=\"445\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81853 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ad-example.jpg 642w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ad-example-480x333.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 642px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instead of manually adjusting each ad for every city, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024\">tailor your ads<\/a> easily by using <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9773001?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dynamic location insertion<\/a> in your Responsive Search Ads. Dynamic location insertion works almost identically to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/17\/dynamic-keyword-insertion-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Dynamic Keyword Insertion<\/a>, just instead of inserting the keyword directly into your ad\u2019s text, these ads will automatically be customized to your user\u2019s location.<\/p>\n<p>To get started with Dynamic Location Insertion in your RSAs, simply write a new headline or description in an RSA. You can insert the location anywhere in the headline or description (just be mindful of character limits). As you type out your new message, when you\u2019re ready to dynamically insert the location in your text, hit the<strong> {<\/strong> open bracket to trigger the prompt below, then select \u201clocation insertion\u201d from the drop-down menu.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - example of adding dynamic keywords in the Google Ads ad editor\" width=\"432\" height=\"345\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81859 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion.jpg 432w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion-300x240.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From here, Google what type of location you want your ads to highlight. Within the United States, your locations should be formatted as a city, state, or country. Effectively, this tells Google how \u201clocal\u201d you want to highlight yourself. A searcher from Boston, Massachusetts, for instance, would read an ad differently depending on how this location was formatted.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Location format<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Ad Text Inserted<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">LOCATION(City)<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Boston<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">LOCATION(State)<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Massachusetts<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">LOCATION(Country)<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">United States of America<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Outside the US, advertisers can either show the city or country. Unfortunately, local international equivalents like provinces or prefectures aren\u2019t yet supported.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there\u2019s a final option to include \u201cdefault text\u201d within your dynamic location insertion parameter. This default text will only show when Google can\u2019t insert the name of the searcher\u2019s location directly in the ad text. This might happen due to character limits or if Google can\u2019t easily identify the exact location of a searcher.<\/p>\n<p>This headline might read &#8220;Proudly Serving {LOCATION(City): Your City}&#8221; when you see it in Google Ads. But Google will dynamically change it to read \u201cproudly serving Boston\u201d or \u201cproudly serving Cambridge\u201d when users search from those locations. But when someone from a long-named place like Manchester-by-the-Sea searches for you, your ad will use the default text and simply read \u201cproudly serving your city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udccd Is your Google Ads account structure optimized for local ads?

Create location assets (optimize your Google Business Profile)<\/h3>\n<p>The first absolute must-do for any local business is to claim, complete, and keep their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Business Profile<\/a> (GBP) up to date! This helps customers searching for your business, and will also hugely improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local SEO<\/a> to help you stand out from your competitors on the SERP. But your GBP can also help you with your PPC results as well. You can link your Google Business Profile directly to your ads and create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/19\/adwords-location-extensions-guide#:~:text=Location%20extensions%20allow%20you%20to,is%20a%20pretty%20powerful%20option.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">location assets (formerly location extensions).<\/a><\/p>\n<p>With location assets, your text ads will highlight your local business address(es) and current hours to local searchers. On mobile devices, searchers will also have the option to call your local branch from the SERP directly. Clicking on the address will open up your full Google Business Profile and allow searchers to get directions or begin navigating to your branch in Google Maps.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-assets.jpg\" alt=\"how to localize google ads - example of a location asset\" width=\"751\" height=\"255\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81858 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-assets.jpg 751w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-assets-480x163.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, once you\u2019ve enabled location assets within your campaigns, your Google Business Profile may occasionally show at the top of the local map pack as a prominent sponsored listing with extra lines of text to distinguish you from other local businesses.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-google-business-profile.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - google business profile ad examples\" width=\"804\" height=\"456\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81857 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-google-business-profile.jpg 804w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-google-business-profile-480x272.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Recently, Google also started rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/07\/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional enhancements to its location assets<\/a>, such as automatically highlighting your GBP\u2019s cover photo alongside your text ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - screenshot of google business profile images in ads \" width=\"677\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81856 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad.jpg 677w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These advantages aren\u2019t unique to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-scripts\">optimizing<\/a> just your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ad-strength\">Google Ads<\/a> though. Microsoft Advertising has similar location extensions. Unlike Google Ads, you don\u2019t need to link your GBP or Bing Places account to Microsoft Advertising to use location extensions. You can enter each location\u2019s address and hours within Microsoft Advertising to enable this feature. Additionally, Microsoft also recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/microsoft-launches-local-search-ads-for-bing\/481731\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Search Ads for Bing<\/a>, which highlights advertisers&#8217; location extensions in local map results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-microsoft-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"local microsoft ads - example of bing places ads\" width=\"461\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81855 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-microsoft-ads-example.jpg 461w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-microsoft-ads-example-278x300.jpg 278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-assets-for-local-ads\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Take advantage of other local ad assets<\/h3>\n<p>Although location assets are the most well-known asset for local advertisers, there are several other assets that can also be used to add a local flair to your PPC ads. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/03\/structured-snippets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Structured snippets<\/a>, for instance, can complement your ads with a list of neighborhoods that your business serves.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-callout-assets.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - example of google ad using structured snippet\" width=\"780\" height=\"232\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81854 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-callout-assets.jpg 780w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localize-google-ads-callout-assets-480x143.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To set up neighborhood structured snippets, simply create a new structured snippet asset and choose the \u201cneighborhood\u201d header. Then proceed to list at least three neighborhoods or areas that you serve as \u201cvalues.\u201d Generally, these values will appear in the same order that you enter them here, so prioritize your top neighborhoods in the first positions to maximize their effectiveness and visibility. Your neighborhood structured snippets can still appear alongside other structured snippets used to highlight your services, brands, models, and other headers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-headline.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - local headline examples \" width=\"600\" height=\"633\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81861 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-headline.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/localized-google-ads-headline-480x506.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sitelinks can also be incredibly useful to help highlight your local ads. If you service different areas and have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dedicated landing page<\/a> for each area or office, these can easily be utilized as highly visible sitelinks that both spotlight your local experience and help send local searchers to the most relevant page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-sitelinks.jpg\" alt=\"local google ads - sitelinks for locations example\" width=\"842\" height=\"240\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81860 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-sitelinks.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-sitelinks-480x137.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t overlook the small but versatile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/08\/adwords-callout-extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">callout assets<\/a>! With up to 25 characters of text each, these assets are flexible and easy ways to call out unique pieces of your business. Differentiate yourself from national brands by including callouts like \u201clocal family owned,\u201d \u201cserving Boston since 1989,\u201d \u201clocal experts,\u201d and other similar messages to add some local flair to your ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-ad-assets.png\" alt=\"local google ads - google ad callout assets screenshot\" width=\"530\" height=\"234\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81851 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-ad-assets.png 530w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/local-google-ads-ad-assets-480x212.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 530px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bing has some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional unique features<\/a> that Google doesn\u2019t have for your ads.
