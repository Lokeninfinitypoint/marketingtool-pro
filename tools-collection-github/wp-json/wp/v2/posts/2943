What, you\u2019ve never heard that one before? Something about beans? Whatever, you\u2019re crazy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/more-newsletter-subscribers1-1.png\" alt=\"getting more newsletter subscribers\" width=\"785\" height=\"572\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Email newsletter subscribers are valuable soft leads that, with the right amount of gentle cajoling, could end up one day as full-fledged customers or clients. That\u2019s why today, we\u2019re bringing you 27 genius (if I do say so myself) strategies to boost newsletter subscribers! Can you sense the impending full inbox? I sure can! Here we go.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get more email newsletter signups<\/h2>\n<h3>Blowout the incentives<\/h3>\n<p>One <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dma.org.uk\/toolkit\/email-tracking-report-2012\">DMA report<\/a> shows that 60% of users sign up for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/30\/video-email-marketing\">email newsletter<\/a> to receive offers and sales. So push it \u2013 push it good. Here are some incentives that might attract signups:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sign up now for PuppyParcel and get an adorable puppy delivered to your doorstep each week. Soon you\u2019ll be swimming in unconditional love! And probably some poo.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or, more realistically:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sign up and get cutting-edge marketing insights delivered to your inbox.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Subscribe to our dining newsletter &#8211; we\u2019ll dish out exclusive deals and coupons for local restaurants.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Be likeable<\/h3>\n<p>The same DMCA report from above also claims that 40% of respondents sign up for your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/05\/creative-newsletter-names\">newsletter<\/a> because they like your brand. Put on a smile and charm the pants off of your visitors!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Embed a data capture form instead of a link to a signup page.<\/strong> A link to your signup page means clicking away from the main site, inputting personal info, and confirming. These multiple steps add up, as every extra click decreases your chance of fresh signups. Instead, make it as easy as possible and put the data capture form right on your page, be it in a sidebar, header, or footer.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/more-newsletter-signups-1.png\" alt=\"how to get more newsletter signups\" width=\"1044\" height=\"602\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A email sign up in the footer from JCrew<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Run a contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes<\/h3>\n<p>Ask for email signups within your contest entry form.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep your email newsletter signup form short<\/h3>\n<p>Really short. Like maybe just ask for the email address.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20sigups20DIY-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups DIY\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Add a newsletter signup option to the comment box<\/h3>\n<p>Many commenting sections require that users input their email address in order to add a comment (done mainly to prevent spam). Since they\u2019re <em>already<\/em> adding their email, why not add a \u201csignup for our newsletter\u201d checkbox alongside it? Any place where users are already inserting their email address is a great opportunity to add a subscriber checkbox to opt in to your email list.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider signup form placement<\/h3>\n<p>There are a few main spots most marketers choose to place their newsletter signup forms. While all these options can work, the optimal signup placement can vary depending on your site design, audience, and industry. These are recommended spots for placing your newsletter. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/26\/ab-testing-best-practices\">A\/B test<\/a> different placements and see what works for you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top of the sidebar<\/li>\n<li>Top header<\/li>\n<li>After a post<\/li>\n<li>Footer<\/li>\n<li>Pop-up box<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can even try multiple <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a> signup options at once, just try to avoid coming off as spammy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/multiple-signup-forms-1.png\" alt=\"newsletter signup forms\" width=\"1032\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Affiliate advertising<\/h3>\n<p>If you know the value of a subscriber, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/16\/affiliate-marketing-small-business\">affiliate<\/a> advertising is another option for increasing your subscriber base. You\u2019ll pay an affiliate a set amount for every time they get someone to sign up for your newsletter (basically, an ad for your newsletter on another person\u2019s website).<\/p>\n<p>The goal here is to make sure you are paying the affiliate less than the value of a new subscriber. This requires that you already have an understanding of your usual <a href=\"\/cost-per-lead\">cost per lead<\/a> and the value of a new lead for your business.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>Offer a multi-part email educational course<\/h3>\n<p>One incentive for getting site visitors to sign up for your email newsletter is by promoting an email course you\u2019ll receive when you sign up \u2013 for example, \u201cLearn How to Start a Blog in Just 3 Days,\u201d with a new lesson sent to subscribers each consecutive day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-email-list-signup-1.png\" alt=\"increase email signup list\" width=\"900\" height=\"643\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Give a sneak peek<\/h3>\n<p>Provide part of a resource for free, promising more when a user signs up. For example, do a post on &#8220;5 Ways to Get More Traffic to Your Blog.&#8221; At the bottom, have something along the lines of:<\/p>\n<p><em>Learn more traffic techniques \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDL25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">download our exclusive guide<\/a> to increasing traffic with 25 additional strategies on boosting traffic to your website.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Remind visitors of subscriber-only benefits<\/h3>\n<p>On your site, remind visitors that newsletter subscribers get exclusive benefits, like your latest and greatest white papers, or free download kits.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-newsletter-subscribers-1.png\" alt=\"increase newsletter subscribers\" width=\"637\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Amy Lynn Andrews emphasizes the exclusive tips available in her \u201cuseletter\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Consider social proof<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have a decent number of subscribers, consider including social proof by indicating how many email subscribers you\u2019ve already obtained. Make sure you test this though, as some actually found this to decrease subscriptions.<\/p>\n<h3>Add signup options to your social media accounts<\/h3>\n<p>Some social media sites make it easy to add a newsletter signup option on your social network page. Facebook has numerous third-party apps that let you add custom tab options, such as an email signup!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/newsletter-signups-1.png\" alt=\"how to get more newsletter signups\" width=\"586\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Not all sites make it so easy though. If you have the space, try adding a newsletter signup link in your social media <em>about<\/em> section, in addition to your regular website link.<\/p>\n<h3>Post offers on Facebook that require an email signup to obtain<\/h3>\n<p>Put up an email signup gate that requires users to join your newsletter before obtaining offers. Then promote the offer on Facebook. If you\u2019re providing something valuable, many users will gladly give their email address in exchange for a resource.<\/p>\n<h3>Instant offer for first-time subscribers<\/h3>\n<p>Try offering an instant incentive for becoming a newsletter subscriber. If you&#8217;re doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/23\/email-marketing-ecommerce\">email marketing for an ecommerce site<\/a>, you might offer a 20% off discount voucher.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get-more-email-signups-1.png\" width=\"567\" height=\"509\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Host webinars<\/h3>\n<p>Use your webinar signup form to collect email addresses before viewers attend the advice.

They may sign up as a subscriber so that they can join in on the fun!<\/p>\n<h3>Add an email signup option to your checkout page<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re e-commerce, add an \u201copt-in for our newsletter\u201d checkbox in your checkout page. Don\u2019t forget to remind them about the coupons they\u2019ll get which they can use on their next order.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some great\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">call to action examples for email signups<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Always consider visitor intent<\/h3>\n<p>When placing your newsletter subscriber forms, always think about the mindset of user at that moment within your site\u2019s page structure.<\/p>\n<p>Your copy should vary depending on where your signup link or form is placed. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In e-commerce checkout:<\/strong> <em>Opt-in for our newsletter to get coupons, special discounts, and the latest fashion news delivered straight to your inbox.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>In a blog post:<\/strong> <em>Did you like this post?

This can be discrete or tacky depending on how you go about it \u2013 make sure it doesn\u2019t interfere too much with the users\u2019 experience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/more-email-signups-1.png\" alt=\"more email signups\" width=\"1124\" height=\"568\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Give your newsletter an enticing name<\/h3>\n<p>Just calling it \u201cthe newsletter\u201d can get stale. Instead, try something a bit more snappy like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>InsiderBeat<\/li>\n<li>StyleMail<\/li>\n<li>MarketingMavericks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or check out these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/05\/creative-newsletter-names\">75+ creative newsletter names<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Try using the word \u201cfree\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>While it\u2019s already expected that an email newsletter will be free, the word itself can be quite alluring. Try adding the word \u201cfree\u201d to your signup copy and see how it affects signups.<\/p>\n<h3>Be upfront about email frequency<\/h3>\n<p>Users get hives at the idea of having their inbox flooded with spam. Setting good precedent about how often you\u2019ll be emailing them will help alleviate those fears. Consider using the words weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or even \u201cperiodically.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get-more-subscribers-1.png\" alt=\"get more email subscribers\" width=\"261\" height=\"353\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Purchasing or renting emails<\/h3>\n<p>It is an option, but not a fantastic one. Those leads aren\u2019t qualified and could make you come off as spammy, damaging your reputation. They also won\u2019t likely be subscribers for very long. Confused users getting emails from a business they have no experience with will quickly unsubscribe from the mailing list.<\/p>\n<h3>If you tell me to <em>test<\/em> one more time\u2026.<\/h3>\n<p>Well guess what yo? I\u2019m gonna. A\/B testing your sign up forms is probably the most powerful thing you can do to increase email signups. Test button color, placement, copy, punctuation, style, etc. Go all Frankenstein on that thing.<\/p>\n<h3>How to increase newsletter subscribers: Follow these 27 tips to increase sign-ups [Summary]:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Offer more incentives<\/li>\n<li>Make your brand likeable<\/li>\n<li>Use an email capture form instead of linking to a sign-up page<\/li>\n<li>Run a contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes and capture email sign-ups<\/li>\n<li>Keep your email newsletter sign-up form short<\/li>\n<li>Add a newsletter sign-up option to the comment box on your blog<\/li>\n<li>A\/B test your sign-up form page placement<\/li>\n<li>Leverage affiliate advertising options<\/li>\n<li>Offer a multi-part email-based educational course<\/li>\n<li>Give a sneak peek or other resource away for free<\/li>\n<li>Remind visitors of the subscriber-only benefits they will receive by subscribing to your email newsletter<\/li>\n<li>Demonstrate social proof<\/li>\n<li>Add email newsletter sign-up options to your social media accounts<\/li>\n<li>Post offers to Facebook that require an email sign-up<\/li>\n<li>Offer an instant offer for first-time subscribers<\/li>\n<li>Host a webinar<\/li>\n<li>Place your newsletter sign-up after your blog post<\/li>\n<li>Add a newsletter pop-up to your website<\/li>\n<li>Enable people to subscribe to your newsletter via your email signature<\/li>\n<li>Host exclusive giveaways for email subscribers<\/li>\n<li>Add an email newsletter signup option to your checkout page<\/li>\n<li>Always consider the visitor intent<\/li>\n<li>Try a floating sign-up form<\/li>\n<li>Give your newsletter an enticing name<\/li>\n<li>Use the word &#8220;free&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Be upfront about the frequency of the emails you will send out<\/li>\n<li>Purchase or rent emails<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As your list grows, remember to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/30\/tips-to-declutter-your-email-list\">clean it out regularly<\/a> to keep your results strong.
