So far, the above image (and the others it has inspired) is one of the most viral memes of 2018. If you\u2019re confused, don\u2019t worry. I laugh every time I see it and I honestly have no idea why.<\/p>\n<p>Meme marketing \u2012 using viral humor to expand your brand visibility across social media \u2013 is a game of high risk and high reward. The risk: falling flat on your face in cringeworthy fashion.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20ruffles.png\" alt=\"ruffles twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"761\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lazy, lazy, lazy. There\u2019s nothing clever or nuanced going on here. Ruffles shoehorned a meme into this tweet and expected us to mindlessly react with Scrooge-style swan dives into pools filled with their chips. Rude!<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0reward: appealing to a lot of young people who appreciate personable brands that don\u2019t take things too seriously. Plus, a viral tweet is free advertising for your company.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some hilarious tweets from five of the funniest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/14\/twitter-statistics\">Twitter<\/a> accounts out there: all millennial-approved companies that brilliantly use Twitter to build their brands and reach their audience.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Denny\u2019s (@DennysDiner, 501K followers)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their restaurants are retro, but their social team knows what makes people laugh in 2018. Mixing absurdity and sadness, the tweets from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DennysDiner\">@DennysDiner<\/a> are hugely popular among people my age.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20dennys2042020resized.png\" alt=\"dennys 420 twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A common theme throughout the tweets featured in this blog post is brand self-awareness. Denny\u2019s knows that they appeal to stoners, and they embrace it.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20dennys20human20hands.png\" alt=\"dennys human hands twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is what Denny\u2019s does best on Twitter: they find ways to incorporate their core products \u2012 namely, pancakes \u2012 into weird and hilarious contexts. Blending something as innocent as a pancake into a joke about loneliness is a guaranteed winner.<\/p>\n<h3>How can you apply the Denny\u2019s brand\u00a0approach to your Twitter account?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pick a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/06\/how-to-market-a-product\">core product<\/a> or service of yours and figure out how you can make it funny. So, if you sell office chairs, maybe suggest to your Twitter followers that they can use your product to sit near windows and brood about the imminence of climate change. Also, pay attention to the style Denny\u2019s has established: they tweet as if the account represents a person rather than a huge corporate brand. You don\u2019t need to take it to the extreme that they do, but it\u2019s a good idea to create a Twitter tone that is more human than robot.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Wendy\u2019s (@Wendys, 2.72M followers)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whereas Denny\u2019s relies on sadness to win over Twitter users, Wendy\u2019s goes in a different direction: directly at the throat of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/12\/paid-search-conquesting\">chief competitor<\/a>, McDonald\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fast food giant has found enormous success with its anti-arches brand, often lambasting Mickey D\u2019s for its use of frozen beef and its infamously dysfunctional ice cream machines. In fact, consumers are so amused by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Wendys\">@Wendys<\/a> aggressive approach to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a> that the company released a 5-track mixtape, <em>We Beefin?<\/em>, in March.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20perfect20lunch20resized.png\" alt=\"wendys perfect lunch twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"703\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, Wendy\u2019s perfectly uses a popular joke format to both advertise their 4 for $4 deal and make fun of McDonald\u2019s in every way possible. It\u2019s trendy, funny, and effective.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20wendys20infinty20war20resized.png\" alt=\"wendys infinity war twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"754\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This meme exploded in the weeks following the release of <em>Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War<\/em>. Once again, Wendy\u2019s connects with their target consumers\u2019 interests through humor while simultaneously doing what they do best: roasting McDonald\u2019s.<\/p>\n<h3>How can your brand apply the Wendy\u2019s approach to your Twitter account?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Netflix U.S. (@netflix, 5.17M followers)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike Denny\u2019s, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/netflix\">@netflix <\/a>doesn\u2019t dedicate its <em>entire<\/em> Twitter presence to jokes; they\u2019re pretty traditional most of the time. That being said, their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/05\/social-media-marketing-statistics\">social media<\/a> team has a finger on the pulse when it comes to TV- and film-based memes. An up-to-date sense of humor is an excellent tool for any brand with a Twitter account, and it\u2019s even more important when the brand is as popular among <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/brand-marketing\/this-list-of-2017s-top-10-millennial-brands-has-myriad-retail-rich-surprises\/\">millennials<\/a> as is Netflix.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20netflix20shrek20resized.png\" alt=\"netflix shrek twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"808\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Netflix nailed this one. They knew that the royal wedding would keep people glued to their phones even more than usual, making it a great day to go viral. And what\u2019s the best way to go viral? Compare the royal couple to Shrek to Fiona.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20netflix20ron20swanson20resized.png\" alt=\"netflix ron swanson twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"1051\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This one requires a little more explanation, but it\u2019s still an A+ tweet. beerbongs &amp; bentleys is the newest album from Post Malone, a rapper who happens to look like <em>Parks and Rec<\/em>\u2019s Ron Swanson with dreadlocks. Here, Netflix pokes fun at one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify and promotes an essential part of its TV Comedy offerings.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20netflix20is20this20a20teen20resized.png\" alt=\"netflix is this a teen twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"862\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Far too many corporate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/10\/twitter-page\">Twitter accounts<\/a> have swung and missed <em>hard<\/em> with tweets like this one. This winner from Netflix is especially good because it\u2019s self-deprecating. High school TV dramas are some of the platform\u2019s most popular content, and they\u2019re not afraid to make fun of them.<\/p>\n<h3>How can you apply the Netflix brand\u00a0approach to your Twitter account?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Netflix does nothing crazy or out of the ordinary; they keep an eye on what their followers find funny and find ways to latch their service onto those trends. All you need to do is stay on top of cutting-edge humor. For example, the format of the tweet that makes fun of high school TV dramas is extremely flexible. Use that and other popular memes to poke fun at consumers or competitors. Most importantly, if you sense that your social team is not <em>quite<\/em> on top of the latest internet trends, tread carefully when it comes to jokes. Few things are more embarrassing for a brand than an outdated, tone-deaf attempt at trendy humor.<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Chipotle (@ChipotleTweets, 896K followers)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key to the online success of the Mexican-inspired grill is simple: they know their market. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChipotleTweets\">@ChipotleTweets<\/a> knows that we <em>don\u2019t<\/em> put water in our water cups and that we <em>do<\/em> take their hot sauce. They know that our orders will never change and that non-sober people are their most enthusiastic customers. Most importantly, Chipotle knows that embracing these things, rather than rejecting them, helps build a loyal customer base.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20chipotle20water20cups20resized.png\" alt=\"chipotle water cups twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"437\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20chipotle20tobasco20bottles20reisized.png\" alt=\"chipotle tabasco bottles twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These two tweets are great because they show a whole lot of that self-awareness I mentioned earlier. Chipotle <em>could<\/em> be lame and take a hard stance on customers stealing drinks and hot sauce. Instead, they\u2019re getting in on the joke and turning a minor issue into a branding opportunity.<\/p>\n<h3>How can your brand apply the Chipotle approach to your Twitter account?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Self-awareness is key. Understand why your customers demand your product or service and make light of it. Then, find a balance of relatability and absurdity. Let\u2019s say you install granite countertops for households. You could tweet something along the lines of: \u201cWhen you want to cook but you hate your countertop and end up eating raw meat in the bathtub again.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#5: MoonPie (@MoonPie, 241K followers)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can\u2019t talk about Twitter branding without mentioning <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MoonPie\">@MoonPie<\/a>. I hadn\u2019t the slightest clue what a MoonPie was until I starting seeing some of their tweets. Similar to Denny\u2019s, the good people at MoonPie have garnered hundreds of thousands of followers by posting tweets that, frankly, don\u2019t make any sense.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The product is a chocolatey marshmallow confection, yet the tweets read like the thoughts of a lonely, love-sick man deep in the throes of middle age. Punctuation is rare, and you can never be totally sure where a tweet is heading until you\u2019ve read the final letter.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20moonpie20linda20resized.png\" alt=\"moonpie linda twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This takes a hard left turn, huh? It\u2019s a processed marshmallow snack yearning for a human woman named Linda to return to him. Twitter users go nuts for stuff like this because it\u2019s the complete opposite of what they expect from a corporate account. It doesn\u2019t feel like marketing, yet it\u2019s making the brand visible in an appealing way.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20moonpie20late20night20snack20resized.png\" alt=\"moonpie late night snack twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019re probably confused, wondering why a brand would suggest that their product is for lonely, unhealthy people. I\u2019ll tell you why: because that\u2019s exactly what a brand is <em>not<\/em> supposed to do. They\u2019re supposed to convince you that their products will make you cool and fun and happy (see: Coca-Cola ads). Instead, MoonPie is doing the opposite, and consumers appreciate it.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter20brands20moonpie20throw20at20face.png\" alt=\"moonpie throw at face twitter brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is funny mostly because it\u2019s ridiculous. Why would somebody antagonistically throw a MoonPie at another MoonPie? Twitter users are drawn to brand accounts that don\u2019t take themselves even semi-seriously.<\/p>\n<h3>How can you apply the MoonPie approach to your brand Twitter account?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I know what you\u2019re thinking: you can\u2019t afford to go completely off the rails with your tweets. MoonPie benefits from the fact that people would continue to demand packaged desserts during a nuclear apocalypse; they don\u2019t have to do <em>that much<\/em> selling. You, on the other hand, actually need to advertise to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/growth-academy\">drive growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose the Lesson of MoonPie (probable subtitle for Michael Bay\u2019s <em>Transformers 13<\/em>) is this: don\u2019t take your Twitter presence too seriously. Self-deprecation is universally funny, and it goes a long way if you can find a way to inject it into a tweet every once in a while. In fact, the WordStream blog perfectly exemplifies this idea. Our writers manage to provide sound, informed advice while simultaneously making jokes \u2012 they recognize the world outside of paid search. Your followers will appreciate efforts to take a step back and contextualize your product or service in the broader picture of, uh, life.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Obviously, not all businesses can tweet like these five companies do. If you\u2019re marketing primarily to businesses or people over the age of 30, or if you offer a serious, high-cost product or service, this humor probably isn\u2019t gonna fly. However, if your brand targets young people, and you feel secure enough to take some risks with your Twitter presence, it can be hugely beneficial to learn from these tweets. Capturing the millennial sense of humor will differentiate your from your boring competitors and show prospects that you\u2019re a brand they can trust. Plus, you can capitalize on the increasing virality of tweets to spread <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a> without spending a dime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Humor is a stellar way to build a brand on Twitter.
