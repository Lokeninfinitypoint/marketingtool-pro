Websites, blogs, industry publications, and forums<\/h3>\n<p>The most popular resources for marketing news, education, and more, were online publications, such as online forums, like PPCChat, and industry news sites, like Social Media Examiner.<\/p>\n<p>Respondents also mentioned specific marketing blogs like LocaliQ (which we were thrilled to see!) and HubSpot. Websites, blogs, and publications found online for marketing education are likely so popular because, not only are they free, but they tend to be more reliable and credible. Many authors behind online publications, for example, are PPC or SEO practitioners themselves.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-example.webp\" alt=\"example marketing resource - online publication\" width=\"900\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89555 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-example-480x244.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>An example<\/em><\/a><em> of an online marketing industry publication. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Search engines (like Google)<\/h3>\n<p>Search was the second-most popular resource for marketing information, with nearly half of respondents using search calling out Google specifically. When you search for marketing answers on platforms like Google, you get a variety of informative formats right from the search engine results page, like images, videos, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Looking up answers to your marketing needs this way can quickly provide a high-level overview (including help from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Overviews<\/a> themselves) to get a general idea of what you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-search.webp\" alt=\"marketing resources - search example\" width=\"813\" height=\"372\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89552 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-search.webp 813w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-search-480x220.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 813px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Social media<\/h3>\n<p>Next to online publications, websites, forums, and search, social media was the third most popular spot for marketing resources.<\/p>\n<p>The top platform called out was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/19\/linkedin-company-page-features-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a> with about half of those who use social media for marketing resources naming LinkedIn as their go-to. LinkedIn was followed by X, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a>, TikTok, and Instagram as other social media hubs for marketing expertise and insights.<\/p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media platforms<\/a> are likely favored by businesses looking to learn more about marketing because they provide consistent and authentic information on marketing trends, news, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-social-media.webp\" alt=\"marketing resources - social media \" width=\"394\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89554 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-social-media.webp 394w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-social-media-197x300.webp 197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/canva_explore-the-visual-economy-report-2024-activity-7257935706319138816-dOLu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB-ca78B25iHsjZ3_182VZCylMwB9QWNnaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Online courses and webinars<\/h3>\n<p>12% of businesses use online courses and webinars as marketing resources when they\u2019re looking to inform their marketing strategy. However, courses were slightly more popular than webinars with 7% of businesses mentioning them as a go-to marketing resource versus webinars at 5%.<\/p>\n<p>That said, both can be equally effective in relaying key marketing information and educational materials. For example, if you don\u2019t have a ton of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budget<\/a> to put towards training and education, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/18\/best-webinar-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free webinars<\/a> could be a great solution. On the other hand, an online course subscription could provide your team with ongoing education for the long term.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-online-course.webp\" alt=\"marketing resources - online courses\" width=\"821\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89553 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-online-course.webp 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-online-course-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>While many online courses come with a cost, there are also free, self-guided classes online that can help businesses in a pinch, like <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/learn\/courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>the examples<\/em><\/a><em> above. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Video<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/video-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Video marketing<\/a> is a core strategy for many businesses looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build their online presence<\/a>, but did you know it\u2019s also a key source for marketing tips, insights, and more? 11% of businesses surveyed reported using video as an avenue for finding marketing resources.<\/p>\n<p>Video content is known to be easy to digest. For example, busy business owners can have an educational marketing video running on one screen while they multitask other business management projects on the other screen.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-video.webp\" alt=\"marketing resources - video\" width=\"773\" height=\"553\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89550 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-video.webp 773w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-resources-video-480x343.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WWqsnAq9YaU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 To complement your marketing resources, use free marketing tools!<\/strong> To start, check out our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads Grader<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"types-of-marketing-resources\"><\/div>\n<h2>What other types of marketing resources are popular?<\/h2>\n<p>Other top sources for marketing education and insights included associations and colleagues (8%), podcasts (4%), books (3%), email (4%), and AI (3%).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting to see that many business owners and marketers rely on their networks and frequent industry conferences to stay up to date with marketing trends.
