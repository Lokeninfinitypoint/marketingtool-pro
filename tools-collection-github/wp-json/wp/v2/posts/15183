Email marketing is a great, low-cost method to drive engagement and conversions. In fact, it is almost always the marketing channel with the lowest cost per conversion since it sits at the bottom of the funnel.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-device-demographic-statistics.png\" alt=\"email marketing device and demographic stats\" width=\"619\" height=\"648\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easy though. Knowing you should send emails is way different than actually concepting and executing them. So we have some email marketing best practices you can follow to kick off your campaigns this year.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Send welcome emails<\/h2>\n<p>To start, send a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">welcome email<\/a> to anyone who signs up for your email list. How nice of them to want to keep in contact with your business! A lot of brands will prompt website visitors to join their email list with a promise of a discount, like 10% off. That\u2019s a great way to grow your list and engage with them right off the bat. This should be easy to automate through your email platform, just make sure to select a regular cadence\u2014daily instead of weekly to keep it timely.<\/p>\n<p>This welcome email from Ancestry is an oldie but goodie.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-ancestry-example.jpg\" alt=\"welcome email example from Ancestry.com\" width=\"568\" height=\"713\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Ancestry welcomes you to the subscriber list and clearly spells out the next actions you should take to start your family tree. You can find welcome email copy ideas in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/30\/business-email-templates\">email templates for small businesses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb <strong>Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>2. Focus on personalization<\/h2>\n<p>Just like other aspects of marketing, campaigns generally perform better when they are relevant and timely. Relevance starts with personalization. There are a ton of ways to personalize your emails, from inserting a first name to segmenting your audience. When your customers and prospects sign-up to receive emails from you, it\u2019s okay to ask what information they\u2019d like to get out of the emails. Are they looking for sales alerts? Restock information? Newsletter updates? Take that information and place them into audiences for each specific tactic.<\/p>\n<p>I recently got this email from Uber Eats, with the subject line: \u201cMary, Enjoy $10 off your next Uber Eats orders\u201d which, really guys, is so kind. It\u2019s got a promo code that looks unique-ish and was definitely sent to a segment of people who haven\u2019t ordered in a while (probably because they don\u2019t want to pay $15 to have sweetgreen delivered to Brooklyn).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-uber-eats-example.jpg\" alt=\"Uber Eats personalized email\" width=\"734\" height=\"763\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure how to get started with personalization or want to try out something new, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">we\u2019ve got more email segmentation details here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>3. Plan ahead, make a schedule<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to send a recurring newsletter to your subscribers\u2014whether it\u2019s monthly, weekly, or daily (but that\u2019s a little much)\u2014you should stick to a consistent time. That way they can expect it in their inbox, you can plan the content ahead of time, and everyone walks away happy. At WordStream, we like our Performance Tip email, and when we tested sending it at different times and days of the week, we found that the best time to send it was the original day AND time. We\u2019re all creatures of habit.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-performance-tip-example.jpg\" alt=\"Performance Tip image\" width=\"650\" height=\"170\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, if your business is planning a big promotion (ahem, Black Friday deals, Labor Day sales, bi-annual blowout), no need to stick to a recurring schedule. Instead, make sure you build in a send schedule that includes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/09\/follow-up-email\">follow-up emails<\/a> to people who didn\u2019t open the first email, or didn\u2019t click through. There\u2019s nothing that email marketers hate more than last-minute emails added to their queue.<\/p>\n<p>This Boll and Branch example is pretty great\u2014they planned out 12 days of Christmas specials and this screenshot leaves out the best detail\u2014it\u2019s a gif! In the B-spot of the email, they listed out the previous eight days of specials. Pretty. Awesome.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-boll-and-branch-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from Boll and Branch\" width=\"709\" height=\"852\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-boll-and-branch-example-expanded.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing from Boll and Branch b-spot image\" width=\"678\" height=\"759\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>4. Stick to consistent branding<\/h2>\n<p>Email is a super-personal way to speak to your audience; make sure you\u2019re leveraging your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a> consistently. It can be endlessly confusing if you\u2019re sending serious updates <em>and <\/em>fun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotions via email<\/a> from the same branded template, so try to designate colors, typefaces, and email signatories to each.<\/p>\n<p>Even this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/28\/trigger-emails\">triggered reminder email<\/a> to buy those boots from Lord and Taylor is branded! Look at those brand colors and typeface. A+<\/p>\n<p>The subject line was, \u201cWhy not give THIS Kensie item another look\u2026\u201d. Still not buying those boots, though.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-lord-and-taylor-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from Lord &amp; Taylor\" width=\"802\" height=\"1182\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>5. Optimize your subject lines and preview text<\/h2>\n<p>So many marketers will perfect the content of the email and then completely forget about writing a good subject line and preview text! Your subject line is like a handshake. It\u2019s the first impression your audience will have of the email you want them to open.<\/p>\n<p>For newsletters, consider creating a consistent subject line, e.g. \u201cYour Weekly Update from <em>Business<\/em>.\u201d You can use the preview text to expound on what\u2019s inside, like \u201cThe sky is falling, shoes are on sale, and more!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I personally like subject lines that include some fun emojis. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copypastecharacter.com\/emojis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This is a good resource for all the emojis you could want to include.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The New Yorker consistently uses \u201cThis Week\u2019s Issue:\u201d as a subject line, and I already know I\u2019m going to get the sparknotes on the magazine that\u2019s waiting in my mailbox. They also use the same header, but with an updated cover!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-new-yorker.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from the New Yorker\" width=\"794\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>6. Standardize the dimensions<\/h2>\n<p>This is pretty basic, but you don\u2019t want to be pushing out emails that use completely different-sized templates each send. For your own peace of mind and your audience\u2019s satisfaction, standardize the size of your templates. Typically, you\u2019re looking to keep the width under 600px. The length can vary more, but be aware that if it gets too long, email service providers might truncate the content.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Have a \u201cview in browser\u201d link<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of truncating emails, add in a \u201cview in browser\u201d link at the top of your email to ensure that any rendering issues can be fixed by clicking through to a browser. Almost all email service providers will give you an option to include this type of link before you deploy, just say yes.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from JetBlue.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-jet-blue-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from Jet Blue\" width=\"740\" height=\"594\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Subject line: \u201cFares from $54 one-way? Time to sale away.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is a good example of keeping the important info above the fold, creating urgency, and including a view in browser link.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Make sure it renders correctly<\/h2>\n<p>As anyone in ecommerce knows, mobile is BIG. People are shopping more, browsing more, and buying more on mobile. This also means they\u2019re checking their email on the go. Make sure your email templates are optimized for a mobile viewing experience&#8211;and any landing pages they direct to are also mobile-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a few different programs you can use to see what your emails will look like in the various providers (Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.), but the best\/cheapest option is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailonacid.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Email on Acid<\/a>. It lets you test deliverability (i.e., avoid spam\u2014we\u2019ll get to that in just a minute), fix your links, and develop a checklist before you send.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Avoid spam at all costs<\/h2>\n<p>One of the worst things to ever happen is hitting spam traps. If you hit enough spam traps, your entire email program could be blocked\u2014which is bad. It\u2019s bad for your reputation, it\u2019s bad when you want to send emails and can\u2019t, it\u2019s bad for your email marketers who have to go to war to get your IP whitelisted again. So \u2026 avoid spam!<\/p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/what-is-email-marketing\">email marketing<\/a> best practices to avoid spam include cleaning up subject lines (don\u2019t WRITE IN ALL CAPS, use lots of $$$, or too many !!!\u2019s), always include a functional unsubscribe link, a valid physical mailing address and permission reminder (you\u2019re receiving this email because you subscribed HERE), be clear when assigning the \u201cfrom\u201d address (use the official name of your company instead of GeT HoT DeaLS).<\/p>\n<p>You should have a footer on every email like this one from Urban Stems.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-urban-stems-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from Urban Stems\" width=\"701\" height=\"317\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>10. Make sure people *want* your emails<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to avoid SPAM is to keep your list serv clean. That means, well, don\u2019t buy email addresses from shady companies. Make sure you\u2019re *actually* unsubscribing people who want to unsubscribe, suppressing email addresses that bounce, and not over-emailing any particular segment of your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Something that comes across as sensitive and courteous: Ask your subscribers to double opt-in. When they submit their email address to you, have them confirm it in the first email you send (a welcome email!) by saying, \u201cSubscribed by accident? We can fix that\u201d and allowing them to hop off-board instead of slamming the spam button.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Put CTAs and important information above the fold<\/h2>\n<p>This is big. For an email to be effective, aka drive conversions, you\u2019re going to need to get to the point fast. Inboxes are overwhelmed with promotions&#8211;why should they click through on yours? Make sure you are explaining the main value proposition in the first section of the email and including a clean call-to-action without making anyone scroll.<\/p>\n<p>This example from Brandless is impressive because most people would think the point of this email is to thank their subscribers (it was a Thanksgiving email, and the subject line was \u201cGratitude for our amazing community\u201d). But they put a CTA right up top next to their header to get people to take action. The only way this could have been better is to include an actual button.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-brandless-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing example from Brandless\" width=\"604\" height=\"1126\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>12. Clean up the code<\/h2>\n<p>This may not apply to you if you\u2019re using a plug-and-play email solution (maybe you\u2019re not diving into the HTML and CSS on the back end) but for those who are slightly more versed in email marketing, try to Keep It Clean out there. Some of my favorite tricks include padding=0 (padding almost always breaks in emails), border=0, removing any stray\/extra tables or rows (sometimes those break the renderings).<\/p>\n<p>Just a friendly reminder: most email providers will strip out Javascript as a security precaution, so leave that fancy code at the door.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Compile a QA sheet<\/h2>\n<p>I love lists. I love making lists, I love checking things off my list, I love keeping those crossed-out lists around to feel productive (and just to remember what I got done on a given day). When you\u2019re sending out a lot of emails, it can be easy to miss spelling mistakes, a broken link, the wrong preview text. Create a quality assurance checklist to make sure you have a clean send record.<\/p>\n<p>These lists can include pretty much whatever you want, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/email-marketing\/2019\/05\/email-marketing-campaign-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I like this example from Campaign Monitor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-best-practices-qa-sheet-example.jpg\" alt=\"email marketing QA checklist\" width=\"676\" height=\"863\" \/><\/div>\n<div>You can find more<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/16\/b2b-email-marketing\"> B2B email tips and examples here.<\/a><\/div>\n<h2>14. Test, test, test to develop your own email marketing best practices<\/h2>\n<p>As with any best practices for marketing, we can expound on what we *think* you should do, but you\u2019re the only one with the power to actually *know* what works. Get inspiration from these examples. Find more with other resources, like <a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/\">Really Good Emails<\/a>. But test everything. With email marketing you can split test subject lines, headers, CTAs, design, copy, segmentation, day of week, time of day, you name it (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-email-marketing\">use AI<\/a> to do it).<\/p>\n<p>Testing is the only way to make your own <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-email-marketing\/\">email marketing best practices<\/a>, so you can definitively say what time of day has the highest open rate, what types of subject lines resonate with your audience, and which copy gets the most clicks.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Report on your email marketing campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, to have a truly successful email marketing program you need to be able to know if it\u2019s, well, successful. That means reporting, everyone\u2019s favorite Monday morning task. It\u2019s up to you to choose the metrics you want to highlight, but I suggest tracking opens, clicks, bounce rate, and unsubscribes. If you want to get fancy, try to find a platform with heat mapping, which allows you to see exactly where your audience clicked. Finally, include some screenshots of the email with the SL\/preview text in your report to easily track the best and worst performers.<\/p>\n<p>Note! With the iOS 15 update, A\/B testing using open rates may not be the best way to go.
