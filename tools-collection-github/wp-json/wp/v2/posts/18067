With all the noise, it can be difficult to see where to put your focus.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here\u2019s our take on the seven most important truths you need to accept along with the biggest SEO mistakes you need to avoid in the coming year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10f23e0e-e53d-4b8e-a37e-c3422aafb824\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-2018-wonka.jpg\" alt=\"how to do seo in 2018\" width=\"488\" height=\"317\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>1. Google\u2019s mobile-first index is already here<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2016\/11\/mobile-first-indexing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Originally announced in 2016<\/a>, Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-mobile-first-index-rolled-site-will-roll-slowly-285590\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already started<\/a> rolling out their mobile-first index. This essentially means that Google will rank mobile versions of content, or whatever content would perform best on mobile devices, over non-mobile content. This has been a long time coming, especially since Google reported that more searches are made on mobile <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/its-official-google-says-more-searches-now-on-mobile-than-on-desktop-220369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">way back in 2015<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, Google has confirmed that websites that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-mobile-first-index-move-24746.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not ready for the mobile-first index<\/a> won\u2019t be moved across just yet. In other words, you have a bit more time to prepare your website.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some focus points to help get you there for 2018:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move away from m-dot. <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-advice-switch-m-dot-domain-responsive-mobile-first-index-rollout-277446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google recommends switching to a responsive design<\/a> as opposed to maintaining a separate mobile website.<\/li>\n<li>Create consistent content for mobile and desktop users. This means not hiding or creating different content for specific devices.<\/li>\n<li>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s mobile-friendly testing tool<\/a> to make sure your site promotes a positive experience for mobile users.<\/li>\n<li>Whether it\u2019s mobile or desktop, I cannot over-stress the importance of page load speed, and I\u2019m positive that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/23\/seo-for-startups\">SEO<\/a> experts around the world universally agree. Make sure you capitalise on site-wide opportunities such as browser-caching and image optimisation to boost content load speed on mobile. We all know it\u2019s a ranking signal, but Neil Patel\u2019s data below demonstrates a clear correlation between speed and position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6cfdfd8d-6934-4418-909f-01dfecb2e0dc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-2018-importance-of-site-speed.png\" alt=\"seo in 2018 strategy \" width=\"727\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Site speed vs. search engine ranking, <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/does-speed-impact-rankings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via Neil Patel<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. You can\u2019t neglect the influence of machine learning<\/h2>\n<p>Briefly, RankBrain is Google\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/28\/machine-learning-applications\">machine learning<\/a> system that measures how searchers interact with their results pages. As one of Google\u2019s top three ranking signals, RankBrain helps it determine search rankings along with content and backlink quality.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, put focus into two areas that RankBrain analyses to help determine rankings \u2013 click through rates and dwell time.<\/p>\n<p>Optimising your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/10\/google-ctr\">organic click-through rates<\/a> can provide significant gains. High-ranking keywords with poor CTRs in the Search Analytics section of Google Search Console are vulnerable to losing their rankings. Prioritise keywords in the top 5 with CTRs below 10% and refine with more enticing titles and description tags.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/25\/dwell-time-seo\">Dwell time<\/a> is the period between clicking on a page in the Google search results and returning back to the search results \u2013 very similar to bounce rate, but only taking the user\u2019s return to the SERP into consideration. As an indicator to RankBrain of <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\">user intent<\/a> and engagement, take the time to identify pages within Google Analytics with high exit rates from organic visitors. Address the quality of the content and intent match to better retain searchers.<\/p>\n<h2>3. You can\u2019t over-rely on guest blogging for links<\/h2>\n<p>Above all, it\u2019s important to remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\">SEO<\/a> is primarily about content and links. This isn\u2019t going to change in 2018, and the recent study below confirms this.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a105feae-c834-44a9-9c35-2fba36b149cf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/backlinks-for-seo-in-20181.png\" alt=\"backlinks in 2018\" width=\"710\" height=\"491\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Number of backlinks vs. Google position, via <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/search-engine-ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Content must be at the foundation of your link building strategy. If your content is bad, you won\u2019t get links. It\u2019s that simple.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one area of focus for 2018, it\u2019s don\u2019t rely heavily on churning out guest posting. While building links through guest posts still works and will continue to be effective in 2018, a return of one or two links for each article may not warrant the investment.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus on creating content for your own site that has the potential to be picked up by influencers in your industry and adds real value. We\u2019re drowning in content and it\u2019s often to see dozens of blogs covering the same topic with the same level of depth. If you&#8217;re not adding anything new, why would people link to it?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba446045-fbd0-4dc8-b6de-c845971e1dd2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/shares-per-article-seo-2018.jpg\" alt=\"link building in 2018\" width=\"362\" height=\"218\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandwatch.com\/blog\/10-things-we-learned-about-marketing-this-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brandwatch<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Use 2018 as the opportunity to start adding real value to your audience. Also take the time to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify existing content that has gathered great results, and make it better. If there\u2019s an authoritative article on link building in 2018, why not turn it into an Infographic or an interactive piece? Both Buzzsumo and Ahrefs provide insight into what content has gathered decent traction. Export the data, and pick out popular pieces that could be updated or improved on.<\/li>\n<li>Scan knowledge bases and community hubs such as Quora. Listen out for common frustrations that your target audience shares, and create content to remedy them. Also consider investing in a social listening tool such as Hootsuite to gain further insight into what\u2019s hot, and what\u2019s your audience is talking about.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Traditional sources of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/25\/twitter-link-building\">link building<\/a> are still relevant and still get results. So be sure to monitor and capitalise on native and competitor broken links and brand mentions.<\/p>\n<h2>4. It&#8217;s time to kill your thin, poor quality content<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s always important to remember that Google\u2019s objective is to show searchers the best result, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/07\/google-algorithm-update\">the algorithms keep changing<\/a> to serve that objective<strong>.<\/strong> This will continue to be the case in 2018 and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>There is a clear correlation between content depth and rankings, as shown in the findings of a <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/search-engine-ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study undertaken by Backlinko<\/a> below.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d0c9370-05c0-473f-b21b-0455e65617f5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/word-count-vs-google-ranking-seo.png\" alt=\"word count vs. google rank\" width=\"2470\" height=\"1700\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019ve noticed key pages slipping down the rankings, it\u2019s important to address depth, and whether it\u2019s still relevant. It\u2019s also very likely that someone else has done a better job at addressing the topic since you wrote it.<\/p>\n<p>For in-depth pieces such as guides and articles, always aim for 2,000 words, and kill any content that\u2019s old, irrelevant and doesn\u2019t contribute anything to your website in terms of authority and traffic. This is known as pruning, and I highly recommend auditing legacy content to find pages that don\u2019t make the grade (i.e., no little to no organic traffic or links). However, always attempt to improve the content before cutting away completely.<\/p>\n<h2>5. You must actively optimize for featured snippets<\/h2>\n<p>Nearly 30% of Google\u2019s search results contain a featured snippet according to a recent study undertaken by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stonetemple.com\/featured-snippets-new-Insights-new-opportunities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stone Temple<\/a>. In addition, Stone Temple\u2019s study revealed that featured snippets significantly impact the CTR\u2019s of traditional organic search results below them.<\/p>\n<p>More SERPs are being dominated by featured snippets, knowledge graphs and rich snippets as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/09\/cord-cutters-youtube\">Google<\/a> continues to generate a more visual information source beyond the traditional organic results. Throw text ads, product ads and image results into the mix, and your organic listings are going to slide further down the pages.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some actions you can take to ramp up your content\u2019s visibility in featured snippets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify page one rankings that currently don\u2019t occupy a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/13\/google-answer-box\">featured snippet<\/a> in the SERP. This is your opportunity to jump in for some quick-wins.<\/li>\n<li>Update and optimise old but authoritative content on your website for featured snippets. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/large-scale-study-how-to-rank-for-featured-snippets-in-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out this study<\/a> to find the sweet spot triggering featured snippets.<\/li>\n<li>Add Quora, Reddit and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/09\/seo-keyword-research-featured-snippets\">Answer the Public<\/a> to your keyword research tool kit to identify <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/09\/question-keywords\">questions that your audience is asking<\/a>, and create new content around these.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6.
