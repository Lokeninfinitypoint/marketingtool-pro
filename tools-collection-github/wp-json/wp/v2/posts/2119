They abandon shopping carts before checking out, they don\u2019t sign up for your beautifully written newsletter, and they don\u2019t even have the common courtesy to read your blog posts all the way to the end.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-herding-cats-1.jpg\" alt=\"Call to action examples cowboys herding cats on horseback\" width=\"479\" height=\"263\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, there is hope.\u00a0In today\u2019s post, I\u2019m going to show you 11 creative and effective call to action examples, and explain why they work so well. So grab a coffee, a pen and paper, and get ready for the deluge of conversions you\u2019re about to experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Call to action examples<\/h2>\n<p>To get your prospects to do what you want, all you have to do is include a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">compelling call to action<\/a> on your website and in your marketing campaigns. Simple, right? Well, actually, call to action marketing is harder than it sounds. Fortunately, there are many companies who have already done the hard work of A\/B testing their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">call to action buttons<\/a>, so you don\u2019t have to. Let&#8217;s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Crazy Egg \u2013 \u2018Show Me My Heatmap\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re big fans of Crazy Egg here at WordStream, and not just because they offer a cool product. Crazy Egg\u2019s messaging is also right on the money, as demonstrated by this compelling CTA:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-crazy-egg-heatmap1-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples Crazy Egg heatmap\" width=\"898\" height=\"519\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>CrazyEgg&#8217;s call-to-action: compelling, bold, irresistible <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>This call to action hits several major marks. First, it establishes why trying out Crazy Egg is risk-free, using simple language that reinforces the safety of trying out their service.<\/p>\n<p>It lists several reasons why you\u2019d want to do this, using simple verbs. Finally, the CTA button itself (\u201cShow Me My Heatmap\u201d) taps into the power of using the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/11\/voice-of-the-customer\">voice of the customer<\/a>, making it irresistible.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udcd8 Free guide <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">&gt;&gt; The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>2. Manpacks \u2013 \u2018Build a Manpack\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Speak your prospective customers\u2019 language and you can get them to do pretty much whatever you want. Case in point, this call to action example from men\u2019s grooming product site Manpacks.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-build-a-manpack-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples build a manpack\" width=\"673\" height=\"376\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Man, reading Manpack&#8217;s call-to-action: &#8220;Now you&#8217;re speaking my language&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>On their own, underwear, razors, and condoms might not be terribly exciting, but appeal to men\u2019s desire to build something and you\u2019re onto a winning strategy.<\/p>\n<p>By combining imagery that might otherwise be stereotypical (a man in a plaid shirt sawing timber) with strong phrasing (\u201cBuild a Manpack\u201d), this company makes putting a male grooming gift box together sound as exciting as building a house \u2013 or a log cabin in the woods.<\/p>\n<h3>3. GiftRocket \u2013 \u2018Send a GiftRocket\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it \u2013 gift certificates and off-the-shelf greetings cards are pretty much the laziest ways to show someone you care. However, GiftRocket manages to combine the two into a surprisingly compelling package that can actually result in a decent gift for the people you love.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-send-a-giftrocket-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples send a giftrocket\" width=\"533\" height=\"353\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>GiftRocket&#8217;s call-to-action: &#8220;Send a GiftRocket&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>This CTA is so effective because it doesn\u2019t ask you to \u201cSign Up Now\u201d or \u201cGet Yours Free,\u201d but allows you to \u201cSend a GiftRocket,\u201d a much more interesting and exciting way to send a gift.<\/p>\n<p>This landing page features simple yet striking imagery combined with short sentences and active verbs, resulting in a compelling experience. Why send a gift card when you can Send a GiftRocket?<\/p>\n<h3>4. Contently \u2013 \u2018Talk to Us\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that Contently puts out some of the best content around, but their landing pages also incorporate some great calls to action.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-talk-to-us-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples talk to us\" width=\"584\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Contently&#8217;s call-to-action is as inviting as its logo<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The design of this landing page is a little unorthodox. Personally, I think they could get away with scrapping the \u201cYou\u2019re interested in\u2026\u201d field, but the CTA itself \u2013 \u201cTalk to us\u201d \u2013 is brilliant.<\/p>\n<p>It could have said something bland and generic like \u201cSubmit\u201d (which would have been borderline criminal), but instead uses friendly, approachable language that reinforces the importance of relationships to Contently\u2019s operation. It also hints at what prospects can expect from Contently, which is dialogue \u2013 not being sold to.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Less Accounting \u2013 \u2018Let\u2019s Do It!\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Getting prospects to take an action that might be perceived as risky \u2013 even if it will ultimately benefit their business \u2013 is really hard. This is especially true for SaaS companies, and even more so for firms offering financial software. This is why our fifth kick-ass call to action example, from Less Accounting, really shines.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-lets-do-it-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples let's do it\" width=\"1020\" height=\"641\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Less Accounting benefits from muted colors and an upbeat, &#8220;in it together&#8221; CTA<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>This landing page makes use of a muted color palette to evoke calming emotions, but the CTA is what sets this example apart.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, they\u2019re asking the prospect to sign up a free trial of their accounting software, but the way they\u2019ve asked \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s Do It!\u201d \u2013 is particularly compelling. Firstly, the CTA itself implies a partnership; they\u2019re not just trying to get their hands on the prospect\u2019s personal data. Secondly, the use of an exclamation mark conveys excitement about the product itself, which is quite an accomplishment, given the nature of the product. Overall, a great example of a kick-ass call to action.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Square \u2013 \u2018Get Free Card Reader\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Offering something your prospects really want is a <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLCROGuide.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">great way to increase conversions<\/a>. If you can manage this, your CTA doesn\u2019t have to be particularly innovative or exciting, as demonstrated by this landing page by Square.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-get-free-card-reader-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples get free card reader\" width=\"587\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The word &#8220;get&#8221; stands out in Square&#8217;s call-to-action<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>This landing page itself appeals to small-business owners by highlighting the benefits of using their product, namely being able to accept credit cards for transactions \u2013 something that was previously out of reach for many merchants before Square came along.<\/p>\n<p>The CTA itself uses simple language that can be successful for many types of business, as the inclusion of the word \u201cget\u201d is often highly motivating. The fact that Square doesn\u2019t charge for its product is likely to be genuinely surprising to many prospects, which reinforces the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a> of the offer and makes it more tempting.<\/p>\n<p>Between the minimal form (just three fields), the strong indicator of potential benefit (\u201cStart accepting credit cards today\u201d) and the great offer (the free Square card reader), this landing page\/CTA combo is a winner.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Basecamp \u2013 \u2018Give Basecamp a Try\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Everything about project management software platform Basecamp is designed with ease in mind. From the style and tone of its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">website copy<\/a> to its minimal, approachable design, Basecamp intends to simplify life for project managers everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Basecamp\u2019s call to action is another variation of a tried-and-true CTA \u2013 the free trial \u2013 but features some subtle, and effective, differences:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-give-basecamp-a-try-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples give Basecamp a try\" width=\"826\" height=\"552\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>&#8220;What do you have to lose?&#8221; asks Basecamp&#8217;s call-to-action<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this call to action works<\/h3>\n<p>Basecamp\u2019s CTA is effective because it simultaneously reinforces the risk-free nature of the free trial while using casually persuasive language. \u201cGive Basecamp a try\u201d is a lot less intimidating than something more direct such as \u201cStart Free Trial Now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the CTA\u2019s diction almost suggests a blas\u00e9 attitude \u2013 sort of like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d This is precisely what Basecamp is trying to achieve, as they\u2019re so confident that users will try (and subsequently love) the product, they don\u2019t need to make an aggressive pitch with a potentially confrontational CTA. Very clever.<\/p>\n<h3>8. My Perfect Resume \u2013 \u2018Create My Resume\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Writing a resume from scratch can be a pain in the ass, a fact that My Perfect Resume capitalizes on excellently with its service.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-create-my-resume-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action create my resume\" width=\"1006\" height=\"565\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>My Perfect Resume&#8217;s call-to-action benefits from the tedium typically associated with resume building<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>This call to action example, by itself, is very simple. However, its positioning alongside the step-by-step graphics above it make it extraordinarily clickable.<\/p>\n<p>The one-two-three progression flow suggests that My Perfect Resume does the lion\u2019s share of the work for you, making the \u201cCreate My Resume\u201d button a very tempting proposition for people who lack the time or inclination to write their resume themselves. A great example of how a simple CTA, combined with graphical elements, can be very compelling.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Point Blank SEO \u2013 \u2018Be Awesome\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Newsletter sign-up CTAs can be tough. Yes, you want prospects to \u201cSign Up,\u201d but asking them to sign up is, well, boring. If you\u2019re struggling to boost the readership of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/05\/creative-newsletter-names\">newsletter<\/a>, take a page out of Point Blank SEO\u2019s book:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-be-awesome-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples be awesome\" width=\"1132\" height=\"469\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Point Blank SEO&#8217;s CTA doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>This CTA is highly effective for several reasons. Firstly, rather than ask you to click a boring \u201cSign Up,\u201d or worse, \u201cSubmit\u201d button, Point Blank SEO make signing up for their newsletter fun and even somewhat comical \u2013 after all, who doesn\u2019t want to \u201cBe Awesome\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, it creates a sense of urgency and immediacy by using a direct call to action in an interesting way. This is reinforced by the navigational link to the Point Blank SEO blog to the right, which uses an exclamation mark to create excitement about a simple navigational element. Finally, the color scheme \u2013 bold orange and black \u2013 is visually striking, which further enhances the CTA and navigational cue to the blog.<\/p>\n<h3>10. KISSmetrics \u2013 \u2018Log In With Google\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>No blog post about calls to action would be complete without mentioning KISSmetrics. Arguably one of the simplest of these examples, this CTA from the KISSmetrics homepage is also one of the most persuasive:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-log-in-with-google-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples log in with Google\" width=\"818\" height=\"374\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>KISSmetrics&#8217; CTA piggybacks off Google&#8217;s credibility<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than launch into a detailed breakdown of KISSmetrics\u2019 bells and whistles, the homepage simply explains what the platform does.<\/p>\n<p>However, what makes this CTA so compelling is that it requires as little input and effort from the user as possible \u2013 just a URL. The \u201cLog In with Google\u201d button tells users exactly what they can expect, and makes it ridiculously easy for them to get started. The phrasing of the explanatory text also serves to pique users\u2019 curiosity, and the mention of Google reinforces the prospects\u2019 need for security \u2013 no mention of OAuth or any other verification technology necessary.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Quick Sprout \u2013 \u2018I Want To\u2026\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Our final kick-ass call to action example comes from Neil Patel\u2019s Quick Sprout.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly to newsletter sign-ups, encouraging users to engage with educational content can be challenging, particularly as this traffic might not necessarily be considered a qualified lead right off the bat. That doesn\u2019t make these visitors any less valuable, but it does require a different approach.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call-to-action-examples-quick-sprout-1.png\" alt=\"Call to action examples Quick Sprout\" width=\"849\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>QuickSprout&#8217;s CTA says, &#8220;What do you want? We can give it to you.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>To drive traffic to Quick Sprout\u2019s educational content, the site utilizes two simple, yet highly compelling, CTAs \u2013 both of which manipulate prospects\u2019 desire to solve a problem.<\/p>\n<p>The first appeals to the more \u201cselfish\u201d goal of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">driving traffic<\/a> to the prospect\u2019s own website. Helpfully, this CTA button offers a suggestion based on the type of user, which makes it even easier to choose one of the two options (and reduces the likelihood that the prospect will bounce away without taking any action).<\/p>\n<p>The second CTA reinforces the value that Quick Sprout\u2019s educational content can offer to agencies and consultants by creating a deeper connection with the content itself by highlighting the payoff of learning. It suggests that, by reading (or downloading) Quick Sprout\u2019s content, users can make themselves more useful (and, by extension, essential) to their clients, which strengthens the desire to become more effective at their job and capitalizes on their desire for greater job security or a bigger paycheck. Again, very clever.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Awesome<\/h3>\n<p>The best call to action phrases are clear but specific and create urgency that drives the user to action. If you have a truly irresistible offer, your call to action should sell its value.<\/p>\n<p>We hope these examples gave you some food for thought for your own CTAs!<\/p>\n<h2>Ready for more call to action examples?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (Real Examples +Tips!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">24 Unusual AND Effective Call to Action Examples You Can Copy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">7 Ways to Upgrade Your CTA<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To get your prospects to do what you want, it helps to include a compelling call to action on your website and in your marketing campaigns.
