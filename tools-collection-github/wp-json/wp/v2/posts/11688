For digital marketing agencies, this likely means that your clients\u2014who may have significantly reduced spend in their accounts or paused their campaigns entirely\u2014should begin to think about ramping back up.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Knowing <em>how<\/em> to ramp up that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/06\/google-ads-account-recovery\">Google Ads account<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> is the first step. For agencies, however, the know-how is only half the battle. Clients are understandably shaken by the economic impact of COVID-19, and the instinct to tighten purse strings on their advertising budgets is natural. So, communication around the reasons (and opportunities) for reactivating ads when the time is right is both a sensitive subject and incredibly important to your relationship. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c1981a00-de11-4b90-a7b8-696dec3599c8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19.jpg\" alt=\"two people working on a white board\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So whether you\u2019re looking for guidance for challenging client conversations or a place to start with your entire portfolio, we&#8217;re here to help.\u00a0Here are the five fundamental, data-backed talking points that we\u2019ve found to be effective when guiding our own clients through COVID-19.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Review paid search conversions data<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This point is quick, but it\u2019s important because it\u2019s a good reason to start having these conversations with your clients now. The drop-off in overall keyword searches and conversion rates in late March and early April was dramatic, but so was the rebound in late April. In fact, by the second half of the month, conversion volume on Google search had returned to nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/04\/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data\">90% of its pre-COVID level<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4535e0bc-2acd-4591-9ea1-957e686333e6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-ppc-campaign-rebound-conversions.jpg\" alt=\"COVID-19 rebound: conversions graph\" width=\"776\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This means that opportunity exists for your clients, and this opportunity is especially compelling when presented alongside the fact that many of their competitors may still not be advertising as aggressively as they were before the pandemic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">That brings us to our next point. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Check Auction Insights for competitive analysis<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Overall trends are a great starting point, but what clients really care about (and rightfully so) is their own specific situation. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2579754?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Auction Insights<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> have always provided invaluable competitive insight, but they are now more useful than ever in their ability to show clear opportunity if competitors have scaled down or paused their advertising efforts outright. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Start by showing clients their Auction Insights from a period of time pre-COVID. Here\u2019s an example of an account\u2019s impression share compared to competitors in February and early March:<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ac20f43c-4f53-424f-b6af-0b70e9a201c8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-auction-insight-february.jpg\" alt=\"Auction Insights Feb-March\" width=\"622\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Next, compare this to more recent data that reflects the impact of COVID. Here\u2019s that same account\u2019s impression share compared to competitors from April 1 to May 18:<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"310057e1-c139-4045-8cdd-5825c9c0afe3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-auction-insight-april.jpg\" alt=\"Auction Insights April-May\" width=\"652\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this case, the account\u2019s primary competitor has nearly dropped off the map entirely, and as a result, the account\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/26\/search-impression-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impression share<\/a> has shot up\u2014even while spending significantly less than before. If you can find a similar example in your client\u2019s account, it paints a clear picture that ramping up spend or reactivating certain campaigns is in their best interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Walk your client through strategy changes for account reactivation<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Change has always been a constant in the world of online advertising, and keeping up with change is always a challenge. But over the past few months, changes to online behavior has accelerated in pace with the other large-scale changes. Keeping up is a nearly impossible challenge\u2014and that\u2019s on top of all the other challenges of living through a pandemic. It can seem safer or simpler for clients to stop spending money on ads and avoid that challenge entirely right now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">That\u2019s where you come in. As an agency, you are your clients\u2019 expert guide to navigating these changes and employing strategies that will make their advertising effective at growing their business. This talking point will need to be the most detailed and perhaps the biggest conversation, so we\u2019re going to give you more to work with. Here are some key strategies to discuss with clients, showing them that you\u2019re up-to-date and can keep their account that way, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">On a related note, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">here are some ways to get to know your post-pandemic customers<\/a>, because they have certainly changed, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Use Google Trends to research changes in search terms<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For clients in many industries, search terms related to their products and services may have changed significantly as a result of the pandemic. <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/?geo=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> can provide this insight for you, allowing you to view the relative volume of your clients\u2019 core keywords and test them against other search terms that may have become more popular by comparison. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are a couple of examples that show major shifts in search terms related to the restaurant and fitness industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_narrow\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"496afbf2-2962-477d-ad16-99f0661e948f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-google-trends-restaurants.jpg\" alt=\"Google Trends &quot;restaurant reservations&quot;\" width=\"757\" height=\"399\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f4cd7f8f-40c2-4413-9b51-7a2bddd93d6e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-google-trends-yoga.jpg\" alt=\"Google Trends &quot;yoga near me&quot;\" width=\"756\" height=\"398\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This tool can also drill down to the state level, so you can view trends for your clients\u2019 geographic area. Test some core keywords against any new search terms that might be relevant for your client\u2019s business. Then, when discussing their account with them, it\u2019ll be clear that you\u2019ve already identified traffic changes and are ready to help them adapt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For national advertisers, viewing these trends at a regional level is especially important, because different parts of their target market will experience an increase in search volume at different times. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/covid19\/mobility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Community Mobility Reports<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> show detailed data on movement trends at a regional level, providing a clear view of when people in various geographies are returning to more normal levels of activity, and when it will make sense to reactivate advertising campaigns targeting those areas. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d737133d-c01b-48ad-84cc-95a5e51436cb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-google-community-mobility-reports.jpg\" alt=\"Google Community Mobility Report example\" width=\"738\" height=\"388\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Shift focus to social, display, and any top-of-funnel campaign types<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Search ads are not the only way for your clients to reach their target customers online, and some recent trends indicate that this might be the right time to explore other types of ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/s21.q4cdn.com\/399680738\/files\/doc_news\/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook\u2019s Q1 2020 report<\/a> <span lang=\"EN\">shows that more people than ever are using social media during COVID-19, and as a result the platform has reached a new record high in terms of monthly active users. At the same time, the cost of Facebook advertising has declined during the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Similarly, ad traffic on Google display, YouTube and shopping increased significantly in April, while Google search traffic was still depressed. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0fbbb093-5083-428e-96fe-09b02ef63184\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-ppc-campaign-rebound-ad-traffic.jpg\" alt=\"ad traffic during COVID-19 ppc reboudn\" width=\"788\" height=\"475\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Even if\u00a0your clients aren\u2019t seeing the same volume of traffic or conversions they\u2019re accustomed to with Google search, maintaining their online presence via these more visual, top-of-funnel campaign types is a fantastic way to stay in front of their target audience, which is online now more than ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Review ad copy (and extensions) for relevance<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before reactivating a client\u2019s campaigns, a full review of ad copy and associated ad extensions is critical. While ads cannot speak directly about COVID-19 (this will result in disapprovals with Google), they should highlight any unique <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value propositions<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> the business is offering during the pandemic (such as a shift from in-person to virtual services). Ensure all messaging in existing ads is still relevant and up-to-date. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7506719?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Callout extensions<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> are a great way to highlight quick bits of information that show your client\u2019s business is staying with the times. Think along the lines of \u201cHigh Sanitation Standards\u201d for any home services business that requires employees to visit customers\u2019 homes.\u00a0 Clickable <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2375416?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sitelink extensions<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> can also direct traffic to pages on the client\u2019s website that cover safety protocols or changes to the business\u2019s operations due to COVID. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Ensure client\u2019s website speaks to COVID-19 circumstances<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you begin driving traffic to a client\u2019s landing pages through paid ads, make sure they are acknowledging the COVID-19 situation in some way on their website. Some businesses have created dedicated pages on their site to address how their business is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/02\/marketing-during-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">operating during the crisis<\/a>, while others employ banners or blurbs on their homepages. The most important thing is simply that they acknowledge the situation in some way and speak to any changes to their business operation or safety protocol as a result. At this point, a website that does not share any information about the impact of COVID-19 makes the business appear disconnected and outdated\u2014or, worse, out of business. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Employ the 80\/20 rule<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The famous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kevinkruse\/2016\/03\/07\/80-20-rule\/#5bd456003814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80\/20 rule<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> is often applied to all sorts of business cases, and this is a great time to remember it. Review past performance of your client accounts, and focus on the campaigns, ad groups, and keywords that drove the best results historically. Focus on reactivating the top 20% and ignore the rest. Clients will feel more comfortable knowing that you\u2019re taking a smart, tempered approach to their reactivation, and sticking with the top performing components of their account will put them in the best position to see good results.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Stay up-to-date with reopening in key areas<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As countries and states reopen different businesses at different times, staying current with each client\u2019s industry and geographic status is vital to know when you can make a strong case for ramping their advertising back up. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/us\/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive map from <em>The<\/em>\u00a0<em>New York Times<\/em><\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> not only shows which states have reopened but also provides specific details as to which types of businesses can operate.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Again, leverage Google Trends to ground your case in data. A search for certain businesses, such as those in the beauty and personal care industry, may reveal only a slight uptick across the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5507b963-c264-4e74-83fe-0429479ef91f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-salon-near-me.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;salon near me&quot; in US\" width=\"759\" height=\"405\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Viewing the same search at the state-level in a state where those businesses have been allowed to reopen, however, may show a much stronger resurgence.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0311066c-2337-4e71-aea0-c7651f8eba75\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-during-covid-19-salon-near-me-colorado.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;salon near me&quot; in Colorado\" width=\"760\" height=\"408\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Knowing any restrictions your client businesses face, and when those restrictions are lifted, ensures that you can present a reactivation strategy at the right time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Find out if your client is eligible for any credits<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Providing your clients with expert guidance and maximizing their return on ad spend is nearly as good as it gets \u2026 but <em>nothing <\/em>beats free ads. That\u2019s exactly what some ad platforms are offering to help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/01\/small-agency-strategies-during-covid-19\">businesses survive COVID-19<\/a>, and helping your clients obtain these offers will go a long way during this challenging time. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google Ads credits for SMBs: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google is leading the charge with $340 million in ad credits for SMBs.

Their page states that they are \u201cstill working through eligibility details\u201d for other countries, so this is worth keeping an eye on. The page also promises new resources coming soon for businesses that were not able to obtain a grant in the first round of applications. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">5. <span lang=\"EN\">Set proper expectations for the reactivation period<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As your clients become ready to reactivate their advertising, it\u2019s important to set the expectation that performance will not immediately pick up where it left off. Their online advertising landscape has almost definitely changed, and their account will need to adapt to those changes. One of the most important things you need to do is to <strong>advise your clients that there will be a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/13\/learning-period\"><strong>learning period<\/strong><\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Any time an account experiences significant changes, it will take time for the ad platform\u2019s algorithms to adjust to things, such as bidding strategy and campaign structure. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are three other ways you can set expectations for your clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Evaluate current search volume and compare to pre-COVID levels<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Use Google trends to determine how current search volume on your client\u2019s core keywords compares to the same time period last year, and set expectations accordingly. There simply may not be as much available, or the nature of those searches may have changed (as mentioned above), so be sure to keep their expectations in line with these developments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Highlight current metrics with WordStream\u2019s New Business Center<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/27\/agency-new-business-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordStream\u2019s New Business Center<\/a> <span lang=\"EN\">is primarily used for generating proposals to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/27\/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19\">pitch prospective clients<\/a>, you can also use this tool to estimate traffic and conversion volume for your current accounts. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The New Business Center pulls real-time data for its impression, click, and CPC estimates, as well as its industry benchmarks.
