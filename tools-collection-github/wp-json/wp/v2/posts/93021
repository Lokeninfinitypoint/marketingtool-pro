It\u2019s primarily a CPM bidding model (cost per 1,000 impressions), which allows you to set a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/26\/marketing-budget\">daily budget<\/a> and bid for visibility across the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Reddit Ads Manager also supports CPC (cost per click) and CPV (cost per view) bidding for certain campaigns, like those optimized for engagement or video views. More on that later.<\/p>\n<p>Note that Reddit does have minimums:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum daily spend: $5<\/li>\n<li>Minimum bid: Varies by objective but often starts around $0.20\u2013$0.50 CPM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udcaa <strong>Reddit can be a great source of website traffic.<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a> for more<\/p>\n<div id=\"average-reddit-cpm\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is the average Reddit ad cost?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/online-advertising-costs\">Online advertising costs<\/a> are never cut and dry\u2014and Reddit ads are no exception\u2014so the best answer to this question is to provide a range. Since Reddit Ad CPMs vary depending on your targeting, ad type, and competition, we generally say that <strong>campaigns typically range in CPMs from $0.50 to $15<\/strong>, but advertisers have reported CPMs as low as $0.20 and as high as $100+, especially for premium placements (like front-page takeovers).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a chart of ranges from various sources:<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CPM range<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.level.agency\/perspectives\/reddit-advertising\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$0.50 &#8211; $5<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/auq.io\/knowledge-base\/reddit-advertising-cost\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auq.io<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$0.50 &#8211; $10<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/aimers.io\/blog\/reddit-ads-cost\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aimers<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3.50 &#8211; $15<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/dreamdata.io\/library\/reddit-ads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dreamdata<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$5.00 and up<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/attanomedia.com\/resources\/cost-to-advertise-on-reddit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attano media<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$5.00 &#8211; $8<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/ladder.io\/blog\/reddit-ads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ladder<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiment = $94.35 CPM<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddiquette.com\/how-much-do-reddit-ads-cost\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rediquette<\/span><\/a><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$0.20 &#8211; $100<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<div id=\"reddit-ad-costs-by-ad-type\"><\/div>\n<h2>Reddit ad costs by ad type<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have a feel for how Reddit ad costs compare to other social media platforms, let\u2019s go a layer deeper and take a look at average costs by ad type.

Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key factors that influence your CPM and overall ad performance:<\/p>\n<h3>Audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Reddit offers granular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">targeting options<\/a>, and your selections play a major role in determining ad cost. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broad targeting:<\/strong> Here, you\u2019re targeting general interests (gaming, technology, or entertainment). These typically have lower CPMs because you&#8217;re reaching a wider pool of users, which reduces competition in the ad auction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Narrow targeting: <\/strong>Here, you\u2019re targeting specific subreddits, device types, or precise geolocations. This increases specificity but also competition. The more niche your audience, the higher your CPM is likely to be.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our advice? Start broad to gather performance insights, then layer in subreddit or interest-based targeting once you know where engagement is strongest.

Here are your options and how they impact Reddit ad costs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Premium placements: <\/strong>Front Page Takeovers or Trending Takeovers give you tons of visibility across the platform, but they come at a hefty price (five to six figures per day). These are typically reserved for enterprise campaigns or major product launches.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-feed promoted posts: <\/strong>These appear within users&#8217; home feeds or subreddit threads, and are a better fit for small to mid-sized businesses. They function similarly to native ads, allowing for flexible budgeting and optimization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp\" alt=\"Reddit advertising cost - Ad for an intelligence test on Reddit.\" width=\"351\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93027 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp 351w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer-176x300.webp 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In-feed placement example (and good content for the r\/law subreddit if you ask me).<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Campaign objective<\/h3>\n<p>Reddit&#8217;s ad platform lets you choose from several objectives, and each one affects your bidding strategy and cost. Let\u2019s break them into two groups:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness-based objectives:<\/strong> Objectives like reach or impressions generally lead to lower CPMs, since you&#8217;re paying for visibility, not engagement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance-based objectives:<\/strong> Objectives like conversions, clicks, or app installs usually require higher bids to remain competitive, but you\u2019re also getting solid engagement. Reddit will prioritize showing these ads to users more likely to take action, which increases value (and cost).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Quality and relevance<\/h3>\n<p>Reddit is a community-driven platform, perhaps the most community-driven out of all the social media platforms, so relevance matters more here than on many other ad networks. What that means is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ads should fit in:<\/strong> Ads that feel native, align with subreddit culture, and generate upvotes, comments, or click-throughs can reduce CPMs over time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ads shouldn&#8217;t stir the pot:<\/strong> Ads that are downvoted, reported, or ignored may get deprioritized by Reddit\u2019s delivery algorithm, which can drive up costs or hurt delivery altogether.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Quick tip: Consider testing multiple ad variations with community-minded copy and creative. Redditors respond well to authenticity and humor that respects subreddit norms.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-cat.webp\" alt=\"Reddit advertising cost - Funny ad on Reddit.\" width=\"364\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93028 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-cat.webp 364w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-cat-182x300.webp 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Authenticity and humor <a href=\"https:\/\/aimers.io\/blog\/reddit-ad-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exhibit A<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"5-tips-to-maximize-reddit-advertising-roas\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 tips to maximize Reddit ad ROI<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/drive-traffic-from-reddit\">drive traffic from Reddit<\/a> at optimal costs, here are some final tips:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be authentic<\/strong>: Reddit users value transparency and do not like being \u201csold to.\u201d Use a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\"> conversational tone<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remember the communities<\/strong>. Reddit ads are particularly effective for SaaS products, B2B tech, gaming and entertainment, niche e-commerce brands, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/17\/direct-to-consumer-marketing\"> direct-to-consumer<\/a> products. That doesn\u2019t mean that if you aren\u2019t in that category, you won\u2019t be successful, but you may need to work a little harder to match your messaging to the tone, interests, and culture of the communities you&#8217;re targeting. Which leads me to my next tip\u2026<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engage in the community<\/strong>: Try blending in by participating in relevant threads before running a campaign. Get familiar with the culture so you can find the best ways to resonate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test multiple subreddits<\/strong>: A\/B test targeting to discover where your audience actually converts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use video or GIFs<\/strong>: Reddit users engage more with visual storytelling than static banners, so add some movement into the mix.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>The verdict: Are Reddit advertising costs worth it?<\/h2>\n<p>Reddit advertising presents a unique opportunity for brands that want to (and can) lean into community culture. While costs are generally lower than those of other platforms, success depends more on messaging, market fit, and authentic creative content than on pure budget.<\/p>\n<p>So it can be a low-risk arena to test out ad experiments, but if you&#8217;re looking for plug-and-play campaigns requiring minimal creative effort, Reddit may not be your best bet.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious to test Reddit for your brand, start small, engage organically, and optimize from there.
