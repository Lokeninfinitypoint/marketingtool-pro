Budgeting helps you navigate these, from late payments to getting the rug pulled out from under you. Here are the key benefits of having a small business budget:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Financial health check<\/strong>. It lets you know if you have enough funds for generating revenue, operating expenses, and expansion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Achieve long-term goals.<\/strong> Know whether you need to cut expenses or increase revenue to achieve your strategic, operational, and financial goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Grow your business<\/strong>. Investors or lenders will first look at your income and expenses before investing in you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maintain financial security<\/strong>. It helps keep the doors open in case of a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/recession-proof-small-business-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recession<\/a>, off month, a downturn, slow payments, and delayed checks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Capitalize on opportunities<\/strong>. With a budget in place, you won\u2019t miss out on any valuable opportunities for profitability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Knowing how much money is coming in and going out allows you to give every penny a \u201cjob&#8221; and use every dollar to your business\u2019s greatest benefit.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to create a small business budget in 6 steps<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you understand how important a budget is, here\u2019s how you can create one so you can ensure smooth business operation and facilitate efficient cash flow:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Separate your business finances from your personal finances<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the cardinal rules to succeed in business. It\u2019s tempting for small business owners to mix business and personal finances, but it almost always leads to disaster. Disaster in three forms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stagnation:<\/strong>\u00a0Without an accurate view of your financial position\u2014that is, how the business is performing with regard to its objective, you\u2019re not likely to progress.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Taxation: <\/strong>It helps you manage things like business expenses for taxation purposes<\/li>\n<li><strong>Litigation: <\/strong>Mixing budgets blurs the legal line between you (the business owner) and your business. It protects you from liabilities and your personal assets in case of litigation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But how do you do that? Here are a couple of steps you can take when creating your budget.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Incorporate your business as an S Corp, C Corp, or LLC. Then, <a href=\"https:\/\/venturesmarter.com\/what-to-do-after-forming-an-llc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">after LLC formation<\/a>, you can get your federal tax ID number and register for taxes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">(More tips on how to name a business here.<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/llc-vs-s-corp-vs-c-corp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><\/em><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/business-budgeting-basics-llc-scorp-ccorp.png\" alt=\"small business budgeting basics - c corp vs s corp vs llc\" width=\"720\" height=\"372\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64935\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/business-budgeting-basics-llc-scorp-ccorp.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/business-budgeting-basics-llc-scorp-ccorp-480x248.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/llc-vs-s-corp-vs-c-corp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply for a business checking account and credit card.<\/li>\n<li>Use separate accounting systems for personal budgets and business finance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Separating the two helps you treat your small business like an independent entity. Aside from tax advantages, you set your business up for higher profit margins. Note also that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/14\/tips-for-minority-owned-businesses\">minority-owned businesses<\/a> can register as a minority business enterprise to receive additional support.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Set aside a contingency fund for emergencies<\/h3>\n<p>Murphy\u2019s law states, &#8220;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\u201d That\u2019s why you should set aside a contingency fund for your business.<\/p>\n<p>If this isn\u2019t the first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/06\/small-business-ideas\">business you&#8217;ve started<\/a>, you know you\u2019ll always get surprise expenses when you least expect it. For example, let\u2019s say you operate a printing business. Then right after getting a life-changing contract, your main printer breaks down before you even start. That\u2019s when a contingency fund saves the day.<\/p>\n<p>A contingency fund for emergencies will safeguard your business when these unexpected costs arise. So while it\u2019s tempting to spend that extra income to buy that new MacBook you don\u2019t need, don\u2019t do it. For now, set aside some of that money.<strong> A good rule of thumb is to set aside three to six months of your small business operating expenses. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It will prepare you and your business in case one of your pieces of equipment breaks down, or you need to replace it. Of course, you could always take out a loan, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have more options.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Identify your revenue streams<\/h3>\n<p>Grant Cardone likes to say \u201cCash flow is king.\u201d Where does your money come from? How much and how often does it come in? For small business budgeting to work, you must have the answers to these questions.<\/p>\n<p>That means tallying all your revenue (not profit) sources every month. In case you don\u2019t know the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/revenue-vs-profit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">difference between revenue and profit<\/a>, revenue is all the money your business generates before expenses. After subtracting expenses, then you\u2019re left with a profit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit.png\" alt=\"small business budgeting basics - revenue vs profit\" width=\"720\" height=\"217\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64936 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit-480x145.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sum up your revenue for the year and divide it by 12 to find your monthly income or revenue. Using this information, you can look at how your revenue changes over time. This will help you find and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/7394-seasonal-business-stay-profitable.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manage seasonal patterns<\/a> and downturns.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Determine your fixed costs<\/h3>\n<p>The next step in creating a small business budget is to include all your fixed costs. Fixed costs are recurring costs that are vital for your business operations. These operating costs either come up every day, week, month, or year. That includes everything from rent, debts, utilities, and payroll costs to taxes and insurance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs.png\" alt=\"small business budgeting basics - fixed costs\" width=\"720\" height=\"450\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64934 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs-480x300.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/investinganswers.com\/sites\/www\/files\/_750x422_crop_center-center_none\/fixed-costs-examples.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That said, no two businesses are the same. So take some time to identify any <a href=\"https:\/\/bench.co\/blog\/accounting\/fixed-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other fixed costs <\/a>necessary to run your business. Once you\u2019ve identified them, sum them up to get a precise figure of your fixed costs on a month-to-month basis. If your business is new, then you can project these values.<\/p>\n<p>But ensure you factor in these monthly expenses as part of your business budget. That way, you can set aside money to cover them. Once you\u2019ve done that, the next step is subtracting them from your revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Determine your variable costs<\/h3>\n<p>As you went through your fixed costs, you probably noticed other inconsistent expenses in your business. These inconsistent costs are known as variable costs or expenses because they change depending on how you use them. They include utilities,\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/online-advertising-benchmarks\">advertising costs<\/a>, professional development , supplies, your salary, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg\" alt=\"how to create a small business budget - fixed vs variable costs\" width=\"720\" height=\"482\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64938 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs-480x321.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancemoney.com\/a-guide-to-fixed-and-variable-costs-of-doing-business-393479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For example, you might increase production costs to get more raw materials to match the increasing popularity of certain products.

This paints a clear picture of how they fluctuate depending on business performance so you can make accurate predictions.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Create a profit and loss statement<\/h3>\n<p>After gathering all the data above, it\u2019s time to assemble all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle to make sense of it all. That means creating a profit and loss (P&amp;L) or income statement, like the one shown below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement.png\" alt=\"how to create a small business budget - profit loss income statement\" width=\"720\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64939\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement-480x310.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingcoach.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/profit-and-loss-statement-example-qa@2x.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard of a P&amp;L statement, and it\u2019s probably giving you a headache just thinking about it. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. That\u2019s because you\u2019ve already done the heavy lifting by collecting all the data points. All that\u2019s left is to sum up your revenue streams and subtract the total of all your expenses for the month.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, you\u2019ll get a positive figure in the end\u2014in which case, congratulations because you\u2019re making a profit. If you get a negative figure, don\u2019t worry about it. Why?
