But you\u2019re running a business, so some of it needs to get people to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can overcome this challenge:<\/p>\n<h4>Address the needs and pain points of your audience<\/h4>\n<p>Some people wake up thinking they need cold-pressed juice. Others wake up thinking they want to eat something healthy but don\u2019t have time to cook. Your content should tap into those real-life desires.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the difference:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp\" alt=\"addressing pain points okay vs better content example\" width=\"936\" height=\"201\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-480x103.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first statement is informative, but the second one speaks to a specific need. Shift your message to why your product or service helps, and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see people take action.<\/p>\n<h4>Use headlines that hook people<\/h4>\n<p>Think of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">headlines<\/a> like a storefront. If your signage is bland, people walk by. But if it\u2019s compelling or sparks curiosity, they step inside.<\/p>\n<p>See the difference:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp\" alt=\"okay vs better headlines for prompting action in content\" width=\"936\" height=\"180\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91208\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-480x92.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Test different headlines and see what resonates with your audience. Try formulas like these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Question-based:<\/strong> Tired of Feeling Bloated?

But not always in a pushy, \u201cbuy now\u201d way.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you post a blog on how to naturally boost your immunity with juice. Instead of ending it with a friendly sign-off, give people a reason to act. Say something like \u201cWant to try an immunity-boosting juice?

The owner of a juice bar might think \u201cWe sell smoothies, so our <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-audience\/\">target audience<\/a> is health-conscious people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s too broad, and it\u2019s not that simple. Are they busy professionals grabbing some juice before work? Gym-goers looking for a protein boost? Different people need different messages.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to get inside your audience\u2019s head:<\/p>\n<h4>Do audience research<\/h4>\n<p>Instead of making assumptions, do some actual research. And your content will be better for it.<\/p>\n<p>Look at the customers coming through the door. See who\u2019s placing orders online. Are they mostly young professionals? Students? Parents?<\/p>\n<p>Check out the conversations in places like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">Reddit threads<\/a> and Facebook groups. Scope out the reviews of your competitors to see what people are saying about products like yours.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want to understand who you should target with your content marketing?<\/strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Create buyer personas<\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gathered some info, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">create buyer personas<\/a>. Map out who your actual audience is, so you can talk to them like real people.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp\" alt=\"definition of and info about buyer personas\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/buyer-persona-definition-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example for that juice bar: One persona could be \u201cFran, the Fitness Enthusiast.\u201d She\u2019s 30 years old and lives in the city. She regularly hits the gym at 6 a.m. and needs a smoothie right after. Fran also loves organic ingredients and reading about personal health.<\/p>\n<p>When creating content for this persona, you\u2019d talk about protein blends, superfoods, and the benefits of adding things like turmeric for recovery.<\/p>\n<h4>Use analytics to track audience engagement<\/h4>\n<p>If your content isn\u2019t working, the analytics will tell you. Google Analytics, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/05\/social-media-metrics\">social media insights<\/a>, and email open rates also tell a story. Which pages and posts get the most engagement?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you post a reel about a new kale smoothie, but it flops. Meanwhile, a post about the best juice combos for glowing skin gets a lot of action. That\u2019s a clue that your audience might care more about one thing over another. Adjust your choices for content accordingly.<\/p>\n<h4>Ask your audience for feedback<\/h4>\n<p>Nothing beats real conversations with your audience. Run a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quick Instagram poll<\/a>, ask for feedback at checkout, or include a one-question survey in your email newsletter.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp\" alt=\"email asking for feedback on upcoming offer\" width=\"1200\" height=\"642\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ask-for-feedback-email-980x524.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ask-for-feedback-email-480x257.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People may share their opinion if they feel like your brand is listening to them. Plus, their answers will give you content ideas.<\/p>\n<div id=\"differentiating-content-from-the-competitors\"><\/div>\n<h3>Challenge #3: Differentiating content from the competitors<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-differentiate-content\">stand out<\/a>. The good news is you don\u2019t need to do any crazy marketing tactics. You just need to be real with your content. Stories create emotional connections, and sharing your expertise builds trust. Do both, and people will remember your content.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to start differentiating yourself:<\/p>\n<h4>Tell a story<\/h4>\n<p>Numbers and stats can help build credibility. But if you want your content to leave a mark, give storytelling a go. Research suggests that personal stories and gossip make up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soocial.com\/storytelling-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 65%<\/a> of our conversations. It\u2019s just how people connect.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re researching information about brakes on your car. As a reader, what do you think would be more memorable&#8211; a dry, factual post about brake repairs? Or an anecdote about a driver who avoided a major accident thanks to a quick visit to a trusted mechanic?<\/p>\n<p>Make your content memorable by weaving in real stories. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.thebrandshopbw.com\/brand-storytelling-statistics-and-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55%<\/a> of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.<\/p>\n<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a mechanic shop owner. Instead of just saying that regular oil changes extend the life of an engine, bring it to life with a real example. Maybe you had a customer who hadn\u2019t changed their oil in 15,000 miles, and their engine was about to fail. Sharing a story makes the point hit home.<\/p>\n<p>And you\u2019re not limited to just <em>your<\/em> experiences. A glowing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/19\/customer-testimonial-examples\">customer testimonial<\/a> about how your shop diagnosed a transmission issue when another shop couldn\u2019t figure it out? That\u2019s more convincing than simply talking about your services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp\" alt=\"descriptive customer testimonial for an auto mechanic shop on website\" width=\"1200\" height=\"774\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-980x632.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-480x310.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/superiorautoservice.net\/testimonial\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>People remember stories more than a list of benefits. If someone hears about how your shop helped a stranded driver get back on the road in time for a job interview, that sticks. And when they eventually need car repairs, guess who they\u2019ll think of? Hint: you.<\/p>\n<h4>Give away knowledge and assets<\/h4>\n<p>Some businesses keep their knowledge locked up, so to speak. They\u2019re afraid that customers won\u2019t need them if they reveal too much. But people <em>want<\/em> to see that you\u2019re an expert.<\/p>\n<p>And the best way to show them? Give them real, valuable insights.<\/p>\n<p>Running that mechanic shop, you already know most car maintenance content out there is predictable. So, offer something people <em>aren\u2019t<\/em> seeing out there. Maybe a breakdown of how to spot shady repair shops, or an insider\u2019s guide on which warning lights need immediate attention and which ones can wait.<\/p>\n<p>Love free stuff? So does everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">downloadable guide<\/a>, like a DIY road trip safety checklist or a printable maintenance log for tracking oil changes and tire rotations, gives people something practical.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing knowledge doesn\u2019t mean giving away your business. It proves you know your stuff!<\/p>\n<div id=\"creating-content-consistently\"><\/div>\n<h3>Challenge #4: Creating content consistently<\/h3>\n<p>Consistency builds momentum and keeps your audience engaged. But who has time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas\">brainstorm content ideas<\/a> when you\u2019re juggling so many other things?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you need a plan.<\/p>\n<h4>Develop a schedule and stick to it<\/h4>\n<p>If content is an afterthought for you, it probably won\u2019t happen. So, block out time to plan, create, and post. Or hire someone to do it for you. Whether it\u2019s twice a week or twice a month, consistency matters.<\/p>\n<p>For a juice bar, that could mean every Monday is a post of behind-the-scenes video of your team prepping fresh fruit. Wednesdays are for sharing a customer\u2019s favorite juice order with a fun caption. And on Fridays, you drop a weekend promo.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp\" alt=\"content plan template outline from wordstream\" width=\"767\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp 767w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-plan-template-wordstream-480x563.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Get our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-plan\">content plan template<\/a> to help you get started and stay on track.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Set aside dedicated time for content creation<\/h4>\n<p>There will be times when you\u2019re waiting for a free moment to sit down and work on content, and it never comes.<\/p>\n<p>So, set a time each week to create content in bulk for the future. Make it part of your routine, so it doesn\u2019t feel like another last-minute task.<\/p>\n<h4>Develop a \u201cbank\u201d of ideas and log them as they come to you<\/h4>\n<p>Ever had a great idea for a piece of content, only to forget it in an hour? That\u2019s why you need a bank\/library\/whatever to save ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Use an app on your phone, a Google spreadsheet, or even a notebook to jot down ideas as they come up. Hearing that more and more customers are raving about your peanut butter acai bowl? Make a note to feature customer favorites.<\/p>\n<p>Before you know it, you\u2019ll have a list saved of content ideas to pick from.<\/p>\n<div id=\"producing-high-quality-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>Challenge #5: Creating high-quality content<\/h3>\n<p>If your content is just a slightly different version of what\u2019s already floating around online, what\u2019s the point? Your goal should be to rise above all the noise, but this is no easy feat&#8211;it\u2019s a top challenge in the content world, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1366088\/top-content-marketing-purposes\/\">per Statista<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to create something that\u2019s both useful and high quality:<\/p>\n<h4>Aim to create something better than what\u2019s already out there<\/h4>\n<p>Before you start writing, Google the topic you\u2019re about to cover. What\u2019s ranking? What\u2019s missing from the top-ranking content? Is anything outdated?<\/p>\n<p>If every article about \u201cWhy your car won\u2019t start\u201d just lists the usual stuff (dead battery, no gas, etc.), you should go beyond that. Include real customer examples, troubleshooting steps, and when it\u2019s time to call a mechanic.<\/p>\n<p>The more helpful and detailed your content is, the better it will be by comparison.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp\" alt=\"okay vs better content example\" width=\"936\" height=\"247\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91209\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-480x127.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Support claims with data and research<\/h4>\n<p>Anyone can say they\u2019re the best mechanic in town, but proving it is what convinces people. So, support your content with real data, stats from trusted sources, and even case studies.<\/p>\n<p>For example, instead of saying, \u201cTire pressure affects fuel efficiency,\u201d you could say:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDriving on underinflated tires can <a href=\"https:\/\/afdc.energy.gov\/files\/u\/publication\/gas-saving_tips.pdf?fbb3c63ad5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower gas mileage by 3%<\/a>, according to the US Department of Energy. That could cost you an extra $100 a year at the pump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Numbers can make your content credible.<\/p>\n<h4>Create detailed outlines for each piece<\/h4>\n<p>Ever start writing an article, only to have no idea where it\u2019s going next? That\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t have an outline prepared.<\/p>\n<p>Give yourself (or whoever\u2019s writing) some direction. Here are some steps to guide you in putting together a good outline:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research your topic. Collect data, stats, and insights that support your arguments.<\/li>\n<li>Determine the main theme. This will be the foundation of your outline.<\/li>\n<li>Break down the main points you want to cover.<\/li>\n<li>Organize ideas into a hierarchical structure.<\/li>\n<li>Arrange your ideas in a logical order that flows and makes sense.<\/li>\n<li>Fill in supporting details like examples and quotes from reputable sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"aligning-content-with-the-buyers-journey\"><\/div>\n<h3>Challenge #6: Aligning content with the buyer&#8217;s journey<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a> describes the stages that a person might go through before buying, including awareness, consideration, and decision.

If you want your content to work, it should meet people where they are.<\/p>\n<h4>Awareness stage<\/h4>\n<p>At this stage, people aren\u2019t searching for your business specifically. They\u2019re looking for a solution to their needs. Maybe they\u2019re Googling things like \u201cbest ways to boost energy naturally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Your job is to create content that answers these broad questions without pushing a sale. At this stage, your CTA should be light and educational, like \u201cFollow us for more nutrition tips.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Consideration stage<\/h4>\n<p>Now, they\u2019re interested. They want a smoothie, but they\u2019re weighing their options. Should they make their own at home or head to a local juice bar? This is where you show what makes your product the best choice.<\/p>\n<p>Your CTA should nudge them forward, like \u201cCheck out our menu to find your perfect smoothie.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Decision stage<\/h4>\n<p>At this stage, they\u2019re ready to buy. But maybe they need one last reason to choose you. A one-time deal, a convenient option (like online ordering), or a little extra reassurance could do the trick.<\/p>\n<p>No more soft-sell CTAs. This is where you give a push, like \u201cOrder now and pick up in 10 minutes!\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"promoting-your-content-effectively\"><\/div>\n<h3>Challenge #7: Promoting your content effectively<\/h3>\n<p>The <em>concept<\/em> of promoting your content sounds easy.
