You&#8217;re basically taking the buyer&#8217;s journey, layering on the offers in your marketing funnel, and then stirring in your buyer personas, all to paint a detailed story of the physical and emotional experience of your brand <strong>as experienced by the customer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s unpack each of those elements, shall we?<\/p>\n<h3>1. Buyer persona<\/h3>\n<p>In order to capture the intentions, experiences, emotions, and actions of your customers at each point in their journey, you need to understand <strong>who<\/strong> they are to begin with: their lifestyle, what motivates them, what keeps them up at night, what makes them tick. This is what a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer persona<\/a> is\u2014a fictional character with a life and a brain and a heart who represents your ideal customer.<\/p>\n<p>This is the context you need in order to pinpoint the highly-specific information in a customer journey map. Which is why you need to create separate customer journey maps for each persona. Business Owner Betty is going to be driven by a completely different set of values, motivations, and desires than Marketing Manager Mara.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Marketing funnel<\/h3>\n<p>The second element of a customer journey map is your marketing funnel. This is a visual representation of how leads turn into customers and customers into loyal customers for your business. It&#8217;s broken down into the different stages of this process and what you offer at each stage.<\/p>\n<p>There are a bajillion different ways of naming the stages of the marketing funnel, but in general, they are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Awareness<\/li>\n<li>Interest\/consideration<\/li>\n<li>Evaluation<\/li>\n<li>Desire<\/li>\n<li>Action\/conversion<\/li>\n<li>Retention<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/customer-journey-map-templates-examples-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"customer journey map - marketing funnel\" width=\"340\" height=\"443\" class=\"wp-image-64567 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. The buyer&#8217;s journey<\/h3>\n<p>The last element of a customer journey map is the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> buyers&#8217; journey<\/a>. While your marketing funnel is the top-to-bottom, business-focused path, your buyer journey is the left-to-right, customer-focused narrative. Here are the five stages of the buyer journey as it pertains to customer journey mapping:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Awareness:<\/strong> The customer is aware of their problem and searching for ways to solve it or the symptoms associated with it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:<\/strong> The customer is now aware of the solution to the problem, and your particular solution, but they&#8217;re still researching it to see if it&#8217;s right for them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision<\/strong>: The customer is ready to buy and has decided that your product solves what they need.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service:<\/strong> The customer uses the product or service your business offers and receives support as needed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:<\/strong> The customer is satisfied with your product or service and continues using you for this particular need.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-buyers-journey.png\" alt=\"customer journey map - buyer journey\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-buyers-journey.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-buyers-journey-480x269.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Place all three in a blender and what you get is a customer journey map.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/wordstream-free-editable-customer-journey-map-example.png\" alt=\"customer journey map example - editable, by wordstream\" width=\"720\" height=\"711\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64566 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/wordstream-free-editable-customer-journey-map-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/wordstream-free-editable-customer-journey-map-example-480x474.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1LaqGYSRKR8xW4z7Ixqj26VYfNPpc8QKVXTxvpbsZ39A\/copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Get the blank customer journey map template here.<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"&quot;how-to-create-customer-journey-map\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to make your own customer journey map<\/h2>\n<p>So now, provided you know your customer personas and which journey you&#8217;re covering, you can create a customer journey map. You&#8217;ll do this by breaking down your buyer&#8217;s journey into the five stages listed above and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">collecting the below data points<\/a> for each one.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Touchpoints<\/h3>\n<p>Touchpoints are the online and offline mediums through which a customer encounters and interacts with your business, like phone calls, pages on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\">your website<\/a>, social media posts, surveys, flyers, and the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-touchpoints.png\" alt=\"customer journey mapping - customer touchpoint examples\" width=\"720\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63687\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-touchpoints.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/customer-journey-map-touchpoints-480x342.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are a number of ways a customer can interact with your business at any stage, but for the purpose of your map, just include 1-3 of the core ones. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:\u00a0<\/strong>Blog posts, social posts, ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:\u00a0<\/strong>Reviews, product pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision: <\/strong>Phone conversations, emails, pricing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service: <\/strong>Help articles, live chat support, customer support reps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention: <\/strong>Help articles, newsletter, account rep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By listing these out first, you&#8217;ll have the context you need in order to establish subsequent data points like pain points, desires, actions, and expectations.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Pain points<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">Customer pain points<\/a> are the specific problems your customers are experiencing\u2014problems for which they&#8217;re seeking a solution. Of course, your final product or service solves for a certain set of pain points, but in the case of customer journey mapping, you&#8217;ll also want to address certain pain points that arise in their interactions with your business.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a company that has a tracking cat collar with an app. Example pain points for your customer along their journey might be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness: <\/strong>Tired from chasing the cat around the yard.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration: <\/strong>No way to explore the app without purchasing the collar.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision: <\/strong>Confusing collar size ranges.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service: <\/strong>App drains phone battery.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:\u00a0<\/strong>Collar takes a long time to charge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p>An important note: Don&#8217;t get pain points confused with solutions. For example, &#8220;needing a trackable cat collar&#8221; is not a pain point. Being tired of chasing your cat around the yard is; the collar is the solution.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions.png\" alt=\"customer journey map - pain point example\" width=\"720\" height=\"496\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64556 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions-480x331.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And remember: Your customer journey map isn&#8217;t meant to be all rainbows and unicorns. It&#8217;s okay if your pricing packages are hard to understand or if your waiting room is small. The point is to identify areas of improvement and\/or communicate them to stakeholders so you can resolve them.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Desires<\/h3>\n<p>Your customers&#8217; desires aren&#8217;t for a solution to each pain point. They are the reason, the greater benefit they attain as a result of solving the pain point. For example, the customer who is afraid to let their cat out isn&#8217;t directly desiring a trackable cat collar; but rather a solution because they have a desire to make their cat happy.<\/p>\n<p>Desires may also refer to what the customer is looking for <em>in<\/em> the solutions to the pain points along their journey, such as to be able to chat with support online.<\/p>\n<p>Back to our cat collar example, here are some desires:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness: <\/strong>A happy and safe cat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:\u00a0<\/strong>A free trial or explainer video.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision: <\/strong>Visual sizing chart.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service: <\/strong>Be able to use other apps concurrently.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention: <\/strong>Car charging option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='heading-more'>4. Actions<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='learn-more-content'><ul><\/ul>\n<p>Now, given the customer&#8217;s pain point and desire, what action are they going to take at that touchpoint? What action is the customer looking to complete at each stage in the journey? For this section, think about how hard or easy it is for them to do so. The goal, of course, is to reduce friction here as much as possible and make it easy to move on to the next action.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:<\/strong> Read a blog post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:<\/strong> Compare product features.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision:<\/strong> Make a purchase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service<\/strong>: Track their cat and get the most out of their purchase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:<\/strong> Upgrade the collar or app.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='heading-more'>5. Expectations<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Given the touchpoint and action they&#8217;re looking to take, what are your customers&#8217; expectations here? This is different from their desires. The desire is what they want for themselves; the expectation is what they&#8217;re looking for out of their interaction with you. You can identify many expectations based on standard best practices and user experiences, but you&#8217;ll also want to look at your reviews, conduct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">surveys<\/a> and ask questions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:\u00a0<\/strong>A helpful blog post with additional resources, but not sales pitches.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration: <\/strong>Reasonable prices, a pricing chart with features.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision:\u00a0<\/strong>Ability to pay online with credit card.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service:\u00a0<\/strong>Fast customer support.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:\u00a0<\/strong>App updates and notifications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note: Not every unmet expectation leads to disappointment or a complaint, so make sure you ask the right questions to uncover these expectations as well\u2014since meeting these will create a distinguished customer experience.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='heading-more'>6. Emotions<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='learn-more-content'><ul><\/ul>\n<p>These are not the emotions you want your customer to feel. It&#8217;s the emotions they actually feel at each stage, based on the pain point, touch point, and whether or not their expectations were met. Again, this is not meant to show perfectly happy customers at every stage. Customer journey mapping is about visualizing the journey so you can identify areas of improvement and harness what works.<\/p>\n<p>If applicable, you may want to point out one positive and one negative emotion at each stage. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness: <\/strong>Satisfied, even delighted with the fun and friendly tone of the blog posts and website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration: <\/strong>Impressed with collar but doubtful about the app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision:\u00a0<\/strong>Super-confident after talking to rep, but confused and concerned about choosing a size.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service: <\/strong>Grateful for the extensive knowledge base, but frustrated at not being able to chat with someone online.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='heading-more'>7. Business goal\/KPI<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Now it&#8217;s time to identify what your business is trying to achieve at each stage in the buyer&#8217;s journey. This is sort of like the third (desires) and fourth (actions) steps, but for you. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be able to pinpoint specific, measurable goals for each stage. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:<\/strong> Create awareness; website sessions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:<\/strong> Increase traffic; pageviews, leads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision:<\/strong> Drive purchases; number of orders, average order value.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service<\/strong>: Improve reputation; customer reviews and referrals<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:<\/strong> Reduce churn; customer lifetime value.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='heading-more'>8. Teams involved<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Last but not least, you&#8217;ll want to indicate who is involved at each stage of the journey. This will help your business to organize actionable steps for making the improvements identified in the exercise with clear owners. This, of course, will all depend on how your business is structured. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:<\/strong> Content and SEO teams<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration:<\/strong> Product, sales, and acquisition teams<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decision:<\/strong> Sales team<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service<\/strong>: Sales and customer success teams<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retention:<\/strong> Content and customer success teams<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div><br \/>\n<a id=\"templates\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Free customer journey map templates<\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways to present the information, depending on your business model and who you&#8217;re presenting the information to.<br \/>\n<a id=\"ws-template\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>1.
