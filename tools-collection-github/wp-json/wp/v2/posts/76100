According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-seo\">TikTok<\/a>, you should post between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/en-US\/blog\/tiktok-creative-ultimate-guide?redirected=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one to four<\/a> times per day.<\/p>\n<p>If that feels like a lot, it is. Especially when you consider that posting <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/how-often-post-to-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three to five times<\/a> per week on Instagram Reels is the norm.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019ll help to remember that your videos don\u2019t need Avatar-level production quality. Even TikTok says that authenticity is more important than big-budget production.<\/p>\n<p>A simple background and your phone\u2019s camera are enough if you have good information to share.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from a psychologist.\" width=\"432\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76132 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple.jpg 432w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, as you\u2019ll learn next, most brands aren\u2019t posting to TikTok nearly that often.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1TikTok is great, but it\u2019s not the only way to drum up more sales.

So of course, it says to post multiple times each day. But how often do brands post in the real world?<\/p>\n<p>SocialInsider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialinsider.io\/blog\/tiktok-vs-reels-vs-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conducted a study<\/a> comparing TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts. Three interesting points emerge from the report:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brands post on TikTok about 16 times per month on average.<\/li>\n<li>That\u2019s just over one post every two days, a far cry from TikTok\u2019s suggestion.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s still double the pace they post on other short-form video platforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rivaliq.com\/blog\/tiktok-benchmark-report\/#title-videos-per-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review by RivalIQ<\/a>, the average brand was only pushing content to TikTok 1.75 times a week. Even the most active brands posted just five times every week, according to that data.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - graph showing how often to post on TikTok\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76104 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The takeaway is that you probably don\u2019t need to hit TikTok\u2019s posting quota. But you should consider a higher posting frequency than you use on other short-form video platforms.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ideal\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to find your ideal TikTok posting frequency<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen that the recommendations and data for how often you should post on TikTok are all over the place. Instead of relying on outside sources to set your schedule, let\u2019s look at a few ways you can determine the absolute best posting frequency for your unique situation.<\/p>\n<h3>Be real about your creative capacity<\/h3>\n<p>The key to growth on TikTok is landing on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/07\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp\">For You Page<\/a> (FYP) of as many viewers as possible. That\u2019s how new content, and companies, get discovered.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - the FYP on TikTok\" width=\"313\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76105 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp.jpg 313w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp-166x300.jpg 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To get there, you have to share content people want to watch. If that means slowing down a little and posting less frequently, that\u2019s okay. If you push a bunch of posts up that people scroll past, you\u2019ll just have more videos no one sees\u2014and a bunch of wasted effort for your troubles.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider your type of content<\/h3>\n<p>The type of content you post is an important consideration of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\">TikTok marketing strategy<\/a>. Does your audience crave 30-second comedy clips? Or do they want longer Q&amp;As with your team of experts.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - Interview TikTok\" width=\"772\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76106 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors.jpg 772w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors-480x372.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 772px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Those longer videos take more to produce so you\u2019ll be able to post less often. Plus, your viewers might get fatigued with too many deep dives in a week\u2014which could push them to scroll past your multiple posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Review your industry\u2019s competitiveness<\/h3>\n<p>Some categories like beauty and interior design are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">more popular on TikTok<\/a>. That means two things where posting frequency is concerned:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>There\u2019s an appetite for more content<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s more competition<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So if you\u2019re in a busy space on TikTok, you\u2019ll need to nudge your posting schedule up.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure where your industry lands? Look at popular accounts in your field to get the idea. If they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-tiktok-followers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting followers<\/a> with a couple of posts each week, that\u2019s a good target to start with.

These tips will help you create a pipeline of creative greatness with less time and effort.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use Duet and Stitch<\/h3>\n<p>One of the worst-kept secrets of successful TikTok creators is that you don\u2019t have to come up with every novel idea on your own. In fact, TikTok encourages collaboration with two features called Duet and Stitch.<\/p>\n<p>A Duet lets you add your video to an existing TikTok, showing each side-by-side.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image13.png\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok stitch\" width=\"348\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76108 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image13.png 348w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image13-175x300.png 175w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/11\/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok\">Stitch<\/a> is similar, but instead of playing next to an existing TikTok, your video plays after it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image11.png\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok Stitch\" width=\"368\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76109 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image11.png 368w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/image11-184x300.png 184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In both cases, you build on an existing, successful video which is way easier than thinking up brand-new concepts.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from PUMA. The brand showed a barista\u2019s hack for brewing coffee and PUMA\u2019s hilarious result while trying to copy it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from Puma.\" width=\"927\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76110 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma-480x274.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Work with other brands and creators<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to do all the heavy lifting of social media marketing yourself. Find a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">popular creator<\/a> and let them introduce your brand and products to their audience.<\/p>\n<p>Minute Maid racked up nearly 20,000 likes on this collab with Spencerx.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from Minute Maid\" width=\"379\" height=\"596\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76111 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1.jpg 379w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1-191x300.jpg 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry about finding the biggest TikTok stars. Look for micro-influencers that have an engaged following that would likely love what you do.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udc4b Emotional content is more influential and engaging.

Repurpose content from other platforms<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re already publishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels<\/a> or long-form video content to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/15\/youtube-algorithm\">YouTube<\/a>, then you have some assets that\u2019ll speed up TikTok posting.<\/p>\n<p>Take a Reel, tweak it a bit, and repost it on TikTok.

Use TikTok ads<\/h3>\n<p>Paying for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">TikTok ads<\/a> won\u2019t necessarily help you post faster. But it could change how often you should post on TikTok in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because with a paid post and the right bid strategy, you can place your content in front of a very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/23\/tiktok-ads-targeting\">targeted audience<\/a>. So you could get away with posting less because each ad will be seen by the very people who want to engage with your brand and buy what you sell.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of an ad from Hollister\" width=\"398\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76113 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1.jpg 398w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And if you need inspiration for your ads, just creep <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/14\/tiktok-ads-library\">TikTok\u2019s public ad library<\/a>. You\u2019ll see how other brands tackle TikTok.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Jump on the trend train<\/h3>\n<p>Since its earliest days, TikTok has been all about the trends. Viral dances and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/07\/tiktok-hashtags\">hashtag challenges<\/a> still rule on the platform.

That\u2019ll do three things to catapult your success:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give you more chances to land on the FYP<\/li>\n<li>Give the TikTok algorithm plenty of content to index<\/li>\n<li>Give you more data to learn from quickly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Try to create enough content to post at least once per day for the first two or three weeks that you\u2019re on the platform.

Batch and schedule content<\/h3>\n<p>Assuming your entire job isn\u2019t creating videos for TikTok, you probably have to jump in and out of the app to edit and post your content. Switching contexts from other tasks to TikTok like that can slow you down.<\/p>\n<p>An alternative is to create posts in batches, then schedule them throughout the week or month. That would gain you some efficiency in your workflow.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, TikTok has a content scheduler in the desktop version of the app.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-batch-1.jpg\" alt=\"How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of TikTok scheduler\" width=\"810\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76115 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-batch-1.jpg 810w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-batch-1-480x356.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 810px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/en-US\/blog\/introducing-video-scheduler-now-you-can-plan-tiktoks-in-advance?redirected=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure when to schedule content, this guide will help you find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20absolute%20best%20times%20to%20post,a.m.%20on%20Thursday%2C%20and%205%20a.m.%20on%20Friday\">the best time to post on TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Find your flow on TikTok<\/h2>\n<p>Should you post on TikTok every day?
