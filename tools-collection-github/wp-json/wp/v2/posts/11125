From your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/01\/homepage-design\">homepage<\/a> to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/23\/best-404-error-pages\">404 page<\/a>, every part of your website should be doing <em>something<\/em> to help engage your customer.<\/p>\n<p>The same rule applies to creating a coming soon landing page. These landing pages can announce new products or a new company\u2014but the challenge is to create a landing page that gets your prospective customer\u2019s attention without overwhelming them. Striking the right balance between revealing information and withholding it can be hard.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing20page20generation20speed20resized.png\" alt=\"speed landing page generation\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this post, we go over what you need to know to create a coming soon page that helps you convert visitors into future buyers.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a coming soon landing page?<\/h2>\n<p>A coming soon landing page is a temporary landing page that\u2019s announcing a new product or service. It\u2019s meant to pique interest, but also to get your customer to act on something.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-pages.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page example\" width=\"800\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeaverbuilder.com\/create-coming-soon-landing-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, it\u2019s not enough if your coming soon landing page just announces your new service. You want it to also get a sign up (or some sort of action) from your customer. This means an email submission. Or downloading an ebook. Or registering for an event.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because launching your product or service is a party, and the coming soon page is the party invite.<\/p>\n<p>That means there are also things you\u2019ll want to avoid in your coming soon landing page. Here are two key things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t just put up a generic maintenance mode template. <\/strong>Every part of your website should be doing at least two things. By putting up a simple in construction template, you\u2019re telling your customer that you&#8217;re in construction but nothing else. Stay away from coming soon landing page templates, and instead focus on making something that matches your brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t over promise or over reveal. <\/strong>Remember, your coming soon landing page is like a movie trailer. You don\u2019t want to give away the whole plot!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now that we\u2019re clear on what a coming soon landing page and what to avoid, let\u2019s look at what makes a coming soon page a winner.<\/p>\n<h2>5 tips for creating a winning coming soon landing page<\/h2>\n<p>Here are our five best tips for creating compelling coming soon landing pages that will entice your prospects\u2014and keep them coming back!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Be compelling, not overwhelming<\/h3>\n<p>With a coming soon landing page, less is more. The first message is: You\u2019ll like this new product <em>because of X. <\/em>The second message is: To stay in the loop, <em>do Y<\/em> (as in sign up for our newsletter or product launch).<\/p>\n<p>To do this, focus on your headline and a short descriptor. Both should speak to what you\u2019re offering and how it\u2019s going to help improve your customer\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s look at how TeekTak does this in the example below.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-example.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page TeekTak example\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webfx.com\/blog\/web-design\/coming-soon-pages\/\"><em>Image<\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webfx.com\/blog\/web-design\/coming-soon-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The headline:<em> Your Freelance Business, Simplified<\/em>. This\u00a0hits the right emotions. Any freelancer can tell you the hassle of logging hours and using different invoices for each client. And while that emotional resonance is felt right away, TeekTak adds just enough of a descriptor to put real-life examples in our head: Time tracking. Invoicing.<\/p>\n<p>Then, TeekTak has a nice clean place to put your email address, with a clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a> (&#8220;Join Waiting List&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>\ud83d\udce3 Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Plus, customers who want more information can click on the CTA button \u201cPlay Demo Video.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. Have only one form to fill out<\/h3>\n<p>A coming soon landing page is different from a traditional landing page. A traditional landing page can get away with two or three forms to fill out.<\/p>\n<p>But when you\u2019re announcing the arrival of a new site or product, you want your customer\u2019s focus to be laser-tight\u2014because you\u2019re only offering one thing: an email signup.<\/p>\n<p>The more you give a user to register on your coming soon landing page the greater the risk of losing them. There are only so many things for a customer to do on the page. Let\u2019s say you have a coming soon landing page up, plus your site has several other pages (About us, FAQ, Contact Us, etc). Companies have shown that <em>not<\/em> including those navigational links can increase conversion by <a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/blog\/a-b-testing-case-study-navigation-menu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is because by cutting distractions the reader is focused solely on the core message of the coming soon page. So there should be social media buttons (more on this below) and there should be one form to fill out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip<\/strong>: Set up a splash page that triggers before the user leaves your page. You can set this to go off after a few seconds.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Set a countdown<\/h3>\n<p>While a coming soon landing page is unique, there\u2019s still the same mechanics of getting someone who lands on your page to convert.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about how the\u00a0 top 25% of landing pages can convert more than<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate#:~:text=going%20to%20go%3F-,But%20what%20is%20a%20good%20conversion%20rate%3F,rates%20of%2011.45%25%20or%20higher.\"> 5%<\/a> of their visitors. So don\u2019t settle for other oft-quoted numbers, like 2% or 3%.<\/p>\n<p>One way to help increase your coming soon pages conversion rate is to set a countdown.\u00a0<strong>You can do this by setting an actual, physically changing countdown clock. <\/strong>Or, if you don&#8217;t know the exact date of launch,\u00a0 you can be more general and say \u201carriving this fall\u201d or \u201cout in time for Christmas.\u201d<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NFWucjkKeRI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The point is the same\u2014a coming soon landing page can look stagnant and forgotten without a countdown. There is no context for the customer to understand how soon is soon.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make it shareable<\/h3>\n<p>We like putting sharing social media buttons on coming soon pages for one specific reason.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More than any other landing page, you\u2019re trying to get the word out about your coming soon page.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your new product or site is likely solving someone\u2019s problem, and so you want to create buzz about your new solution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip<\/strong>: Increase the number of social shares your landing page will get across key platforms by creating a giveaway. On this giveaway, customers can enter by sharing your page on Facebook, retweeting it on Twitter, or posting about it on Instagram.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Make it mobile<\/h3>\n<p>As of this year, over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50%<\/a> of all web traffic comes from a mobile device. That number may even be higher, depending on your industry.<\/p>\n<p>But whether you\u2019re targeting B2B or B2C customers, you want to think \u201cmobile first\u201d when you\u2019re designing your landing page.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of killer coming soon landing pages<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to get ideas for creating your own coming soon landing pages is to check out great examples. Here are four killer landing pages that you can learn from!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Arche Travel<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-arche-travel.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page Arche Travel example\" width=\"650\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seedprod.com\/coming-soon-pages-wordpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Notice how the eyes go to the Subscribe CTA button in the middle of the screen? It\u2019s great placement, because it keeps the user focused on both the intent (subscribe to our mailing list) and the message (take a vacation).\u00a0If the CTA button was aligned on the right of the page, it\u2019d take our focus off the ocean landscape. This landing page also has social sharing buttons, which is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to improve this page:<\/strong> Incentives are important ways to convert people on your page. What incentive does the customer get by signing up for this newsletter?<\/p>\n<h3>2. LandApart<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-landapart.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page LandApart example\" width=\"662\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/learn\/coming-soon-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another striking landing page. Notice how these coming soon landing pages are very visually oriented?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re launching a business or website, you likely don\u2019t have very many images to share. Instead, you can use WordPress templates or plugins to create these very visually-first landing pages where the whole of the landing page is one crisp, clear, thematically relevant image.<\/p>\n<p>One last thing about the image: Look at how the image matches the target audience. This is a site for people who want to camp\u2014and when you get to this landing page, you know you\u2019re in the right spot.<\/p>\n<p>This landing page also touches on something we haven\u2019t talked about yet: exclusivity. This is in a similar vein as setting a countdown. There\u2019s urgency implied with exclusivity. One of the CTA buttons reads \u201cRequest invite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, LandApart may accept everyone who requests an invite, that\u2019s not the issue or the point. The point is it creates urgency for the user, plus it gives more incentive to sign up. People want this, so I\u2019m interested as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notice that this landing page has two CTA buttons<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You can request an invite (to join), or if you\u2019ve already joined, you can proceed to the beta testing site. Think about, psychologically, the effect of this on the user.There are two doors that lead into a VIP lounge, one door leads to the VIP lounge where you want to be, and the other leads to the offices where you sign up for the VIP lounge.<\/p>\n<p>These are mutually beneficial CTA buttons because the \u201cGo to Beta\u201d button serves as an incentive for the \u201cRequest an Invite\u201d button.<\/p>\n<p>There technically isn\u2019t a countdown button on this landing page, but a countdown button isn\u2019t needed. The same with social media sharing buttons. This landing page experience won\u2019t be improved by being able to share it on Twitter or Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to improve this page:<\/strong> This is a highly-effective coming soon landing page. Well, <em>almost<\/em> nothing. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/19\/split-test\">split test on the landing page<\/a> with different colors for the CTA buttons.<\/p>\n<h3>3. LAB Petite<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-lab.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page LAB Petite example\" width=\"650\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seedprod.com\/coming-soon-pages-wordpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We like LAB Petite\u2019s coming soon page for several reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First, look at the copy. \u201cAre you ready for the best modern handmade goods for your little ones? From clothing to toys, we&#8217;re going to showcase modern makers from around the world who make great things for kids. Sign up below to be informed when LAB Petite launches.\u201dThis copy gets the point across, and it also directs the user to act.<\/p>\n<p>Second, LAB petite uses a countdown clock on their page. We really like the countdown page here because who loves to be reminded how long until they can get what they want? Kids. It makes this site launch sort of an event for the family.<\/p>\n<p>Third, this LAB Petite page has a strong CTA that resonates with its copy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to improve this page: <\/strong>We notice LAB Petite is leveraging social media buttons, which is great. But to get a customer to share this on Twitter or Instagram, we think they need to offer an incentive. The incentive could be a coupon or a raffle or a limited offering of a gift with purchases over a certain amount.<\/p>\n<h3>4. App Manager 5.0<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-app-manager.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page App Manager 5.0 example\" width=\"650\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wishpond.com\/post\/115675436858\/coming-soon-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is a great example of a landing page when you don\u2019t have a stock image that can be used, and you don\u2019t want to just show someone with their phone. App Manager 5.0 created a simple, easy to understand graphic that illustrates the features of their app.<\/p>\n<p>The CTA button is slightly exclusive: \u201c<em>Get on the List!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The copy offers an incentive: if you get early access, you\u2019ll get perks that are only available for their early subscribers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to improve this page:<\/strong> No recommendations here! This page has a great CTA. It has a clear and compelling copy. It offers an incentive and creates urgency with its countdown. A+<\/p>\n<h2>What comes after the coming soon landing page?<\/h2>\n<p>The coming soon page\u2014in case it wasn\u2019t obvious\u2014is the very beginning of the relationship between you and your customer.\u00a0You don\u2019t just set up a coming soon page and call it a day. The point Is to attract interest, increase brand awareness, get new email subscribers, and more.<\/p>\n<p>So what comes after the coming soon page? Emails.<\/p>\n<h3>Email sequences to follow up on your coming soon landing page<\/h3>\n<p>A coming soon page ought to get you some information from your customer. In this day and age, ideally you\u2019ll get an email address. You want an email list of potential customers: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salecycle.com\/blog\/stats\/18-essential-email-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">59%<\/a> of customers said email marketing has motivated them to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Now you can communicate updates to your potential customer\u2014customers who showed an interest. You can create an automated sequence that increases as the date gets closer and closer to the launch date.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coming-soon-landing-page-email.jpg\" alt=\"coming soon landing page follow-up email example\" width=\"403\" height=\"516\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appcues.com\/blog\/product-launch-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can share updates on construction (if you\u2019re making a physical product). You can share updates on new features or added accessories.<\/p>\n<p>By leveraging the information you got on the coming soon landing page, you can increase the likelihood of having a successful launch.<\/p>\n<h2>Now, create your own killer coming soon landing page!<\/h2>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed this guide on creating killer coming soon landing pages. To recap, you want to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be compelling, not overwhelming<\/strong>. Your coming soon page is a short teaser, not a full commercial. Get to the main benefit quickly, but don\u2019t oversell.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have only one form to fill out<\/strong>. Streamline the process and ask only for what\u2019s most important\u2014the customer\u2019s email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set a countdown<\/strong>. If you don\u2019t want a physical countdown timer on your page, that\u2019s fine. Just mention in the copy a general idea of when you\u2019re launching.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it shareable<\/strong>. Make sure your landing page is shareable. But, also give your customer an incentive to share it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it mobile<\/strong>.
