Well, we have done some digging and these five tips that will ensure your filters are not only acceptable, but phenomenal at engaging your target audience!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Set a plan with specific goals<\/h3>\n<p>Just blindly creating Snapchat filters for your businesses radius is likely not going to be super effective at engaging your audience. And, worse, it could feel random or even obnoxious to Snappers. This is why having a specific plan in place as to what the goal of your filter is and why you want people to use it will be most effective.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, are you a floral shop running campaigns around Mother\u2019s Day flower arrangements? Then a couple weeks pre-Mother\u2019s Day when folks are starting to think about sending out deliveries may be a good time to sponsor a Mother\u2019s Day related Snapchat filter with this reminder.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c8fd62c-c7f2-429b-a625-04f00168632c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/snapchat-filters-example.jpg\" alt=\"Mother's Day Snapchat filter\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The bottom line is that having a goal set and purpose for your filter will ensure it will actually spark interest and benefit your bottom line.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Put yourself your customer\u2019s shoes<\/h3>\n<p>Would you, as a potential customer, use this Snapchat filter? This is the question you should always ask as you are creating your Snapchat Geofilter. If it does not feel like something your audience members would actually use, then what is the point?<\/p>\n<p>Making it fun, entertaining, and timely are some ways to ensure your customers will use it. Perhaps playing off a recent SNL skit or incorporating some holiday related content that gets your audience members to feel warm and fuzzy inside. Always thinking about how to relate most to your audience members, and getting into their mindset will ensure your business Snapchat filters resonate.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Follow the specs outlined by Snapchat<\/h3>\n<p>While this one might sound obvious, it can be easy to overlook. Why waste time and money designing your beautiful Snapchat filter to have it disapproved by the platform? Here are the artwork guidelines <a href=\"https:\/\/support.snapchat.com\/en-US\/article\/odg-howto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outlined by Snapchat<\/a> that you need to follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>File dimensions: 1080px wide by 2340x high<\/li>\n<li>Max file size: 300 KB<\/li>\n<li>DPI: 72 (*error message is DPI too high)<\/li>\n<li>File type: PNG with a transparent background<\/li>\n<li>Ensure your filter only takes up roughly 25% of either the top or bottom of the screen (Snapchatters want to see themselves!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Snapchat also provides are longer list of submission guidelines and tips <a href=\"https:\/\/support.snapchat.com\/en-US\/a\/submission-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Simplicity is best<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice the last bit of advice in Snapchat\u2019s list of guidelines for filter approval includes ensuring your filter takes up no more then 25% of the frame at the top or bottom. This is for a reason! Your audience members are using Snapchat primarily for selfie-taking and do not want a huge logo of your brand draping across their face.<\/p>\n<p>Stick to simple designs that are relevant and do not take up tons of space. If you really want your target audience to use your filter, you need to ensure they are not overly salesy. Remember, the main reason people use filters is not to promote your business.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a great example from The Detroit Zoo.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cc17fc5d-1c7c-4378-9480-412e4add4c76\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/snapchat-filters-example-zoo.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Zoo Snapchat filter\" width=\"356\" height=\"632\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>5. Evaluate and improve as time goes on<\/h3>\n<p>Just like with all of your marketing campaigns, you should be evaluating the effectiveness of your Snapchat filters. Luckily, Snapchat has a built-in analytics tool to gain insight into how your filters were used and viewed by Snappers. To take a look at your metrics click on the three-line icon on the top left-hand corner, select \u201cMy Orders,\u201d chose your filter, and view the metrics. You\u2019ll be able to evaluate filter metrics like swipes, uses, views, and overall usage. These analytics can also be downloaded to a CSV.<\/p>\n<h2>Set up your Snapchat filters today!<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have all the information handy, it is time to conquer the world of Snapchat filters. Your audience could use some new and fun filters in this new normal we are all living in.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this guide, we&#8217;re telling you everything you
