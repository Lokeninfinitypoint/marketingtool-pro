Before making the change, I had no idea it would be as successful as it was since it went against what I thought I believed about creating a quality organic landing page experience.\u00a0Interrupting flow, even before making a solid case for benefits and the USP, and repeating offers seemed somewhat counter-intuitive and\u00a0heavy-handed at the time. But then, that&#8217;s why we A\/B test, right? We were able to replicate the results on other pages on the site as well, which only reinforced the practice. Moral of the story: if users are ready to convert, don&#8217;t make them wait b\/c you may lose them. Instead, try giving them more than one option to convert on a page.<\/p>\n<p><em>Ken Lyons<\/em><em> is Co-Founder of\u00a0MeasuredSEM.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Kim\"><\/a>A\/B Split Test All Aspects of Your Business!<\/h2>\n<p>Oooh. My favorite A\/B tests. Where to begin. There are too many to just pick one, so I\u2019m going to have to share 3! (Can I share 3?) These are all examples of the kinds of A\/B tests were you say, huh?! what?-that-can\u2019t-be-right,-run-the-test-longer!! \u2013 that kind of A\/B test. OK here they are in no particular order:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>EXTRA STRENGTH SEO CONTENT A\/B TEST:<\/strong> Being an SEO-type, I often try to jam-in a lot of stuff useful information into our web pages. Why say in 1 sentence, what you could say in 3 paragraphs, right! Like take a look at my free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">AdWords Grader<\/a> application, and scroll down the page \u2013 you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a ton of content beneath the sign-up form. Now, some marketers here at WordStream, who have a really keen eye for design aesthetics, user experience, etc. found my content strategy to be flat-out bizarre-looking. So, we tested removing all the extraneous FAQ content that appears below the fold, to see how that impacted sign-up conversion rates. The variant that contained the 2000-word FAQ below the fold won. We were ABSOLUTELY FLOORED.<\/li>\n<li><strong>EXTRA SECURE LOGIN AB TEST: <\/strong>Speaking of the AdWords Grader, the way that tool works is you just log into your Google Ads\u00a0account and we analyze the performance of your Google Ads\u00a0account and provide you with a helpful report card that shows areas of strength, as well as areas where you can improve. We recently upgraded the account login mechanism to leverage a newly released OAUTH extra-super-secure Google Ads\u00a0account authentication mechanism, thinking that we would grade more Google Ads\u00a0accounts. But the A\/B test fell flat. The new super-secure OAUTH-based Google Ads\u00a0authentication did pretty poorly (possibly because it added steps to the sign-up process) so, we ended up reverting back to the regular secure Google Ads\u00a0login.<\/li>\n<li><strong>PRODUCT TRIAL LENGTH AB TEST:<\/strong> My company sells PPC management software. You can sign up for a free 7-day trial. We got some complaints that 7 days wasn\u2019t long enough to test it out. So we extended the trials to different time lengths, like 14 days, 30 days, etc. We measured prospect connect rates \u2013 the percentage of qualified customer prospects our sales organization is able to book a demo with \u2013 and we found that the connect rates actually fell. So, we reverted back to the 7-day trial model. Maybe they found the longer trial overwhelming?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Please keep in mind that I\u2019m not saying that you should adopt any of the above AB test findings for your business. What worked for us is most likely not the same as what works for your organization.

Yet, in this one campaign, visitors actually <em>wanted<\/em> to know the features of the product we were selling. So depending on your target audience, the stream of traffic, the message of your ad, your product etc., <strong>it might actually make sense for you to focus on features instead of benefits<\/strong>.

It came mostly out of frustration and stubbornness. A change in marketing laws for one of my lead gen clients made it illegal for us to use the word &#8220;Apply&#8221; in ad copy because the customers weren&#8217;t technically applying at that stage. After struggling for a month or so to find a synonym for &#8220;Apply&#8221; that performed nearly as well, and wanting to sneakily work &#8220;Apply&#8221; back in,<strong> I decided to make up a word<\/strong>. &#8220;PreApply&#8221; was born. And yes, I used that capitalization. Amazingly enough, CTR and conversion rate increased by 27% and 11% respectively, and CPA decreased by 8%. I&#8217;m not sure whether customers felt they were taking a smaller first step, or if there was some other appealing factor, but it worked. In the end, a change in advertisement law actually led to increased performance and a happy client.<\/p>\n<p><em>Michelle Morgan is a PPC Specialist at <a href=\"http:\/\/clixmarketing.com\/\">Clix Marketing<\/a>.

It was a dual purpose test: by splitting it up this way, we got leads from one page and continued viral exposure on the other (the tweets send people back to the landing page where they could get the ebook and repeat the cycle).<\/p>\n<p>The email version converted at 22% vs. 18% for the pay with a tweet version. While asking people via an inline survey which mechanism they\u2019d prefer, 45% said email, leaving me slightly confused by email winning the AB test.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not the exciting part.<\/p>\n<p>We decided to run a 3rd test, where we had <a href=\"http:\/\/get.unbounce.com\/the-ultimate-guide-to-ab-testing\/\">a single page with the same 2 two options<\/a>, so that we could see how the numbers correlated when people really had a choice. Despite the close results in both the survey and initial A-B test, <strong>the results from the final test were shocking<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Result: <\/strong>In the new test 85% of people opted to give their email address.<\/p>\n<p>After further analysis, we also noticed that people would tweet, and then immediately delete it from their stream.

This pair of Google ads show how even the\u00a0<strong>commas<\/strong>\u00a0between the words make a tangible difference to your bottom line. The difference is effectively about 8%, which in this particular example was probably about $500 per year.<\/p>\n<p>This stuff matters.\u00a0Why guess when you can test?<\/p>\n<p><em>Perry Marshall\u2019s Chicago company, Perry S.

First we saw the initial control page that a client had set up, and we learned that in addition to the trust icons (as seen in logs, associations, etc.) below the form, there were several others that we actually thought would convey even more trust and authority. The client had a relatively new\/unknown offering so we thought really loading up on trust symbols as soon as the visitor reached the page would help with conversion and wanted to integrate the additional symbols into the page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ab-test-wireframes.png\" alt=\"A\/B test wireframe\" width=\"378\" height=\"954\" \/><\/div>\n<p>First we created Variation A which leveraged the extra trust symbols above the fold in conjunction with the benefit statement, and removed the \u201chero shot\u201d that had been in its place (which didn\u2019t seem to be conveying much to the visitor).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Variation A <em>lost<\/em><\/strong> by a few percentage points to the existing landing page.<\/p>\n<p>We still thought the additional trust icons could provide a lift if implemented properly, so we created Variation B, which kept the hero shot above the fold, and instead incorporated the new trust icons into an expanded trust section just below the form.
