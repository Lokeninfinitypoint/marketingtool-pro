You can do this in a few different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Programmatic: <\/strong>Here, automation is used to serve OTT ads across multiple networks through <a href=\"https:\/\/clockworktalent.com\/blog-top-ten-demand-side-platform-for-programmatic-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demand-side platforms<\/a> (DSPs) like Rocket Fuel, MediaMath, APPNexus, TubeMogul, and more.<br \/>\nProgrammatic delivery has better targeting, and can be less expensive, but you have less control over where your ads appear.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Platform direct: <\/strong>This is where you would purchase ads directly from the provider of the OTT device (such as Roku or Amazon Fire TV from our connected TV illustration).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Publisher direct: <\/strong>Here, the exchange happens directly with the OTT service provider (our OTT streaming services above).<br \/>\nDirect means of OTT advertising give you more control over where your ads are placed, but\u00a0can be costly and don&#8217;t afford as much widespread exposure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"03e3c8b6-f4b2-4566-8aa9-44724dac47c0\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-ott-advertising-programmatic-platform-publisher.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"362\" alt=\"ott advertising methods - programmatic, platform direct, and publisher direct\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsflyer.com\/use-cases\/measurement\/ott-media-buying-test-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of OTT advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>There are many reasons advertisers are turning to over-the-top ads as an effective means of generating revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Ad-supported OTT services are on the rise<\/h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.coxmedia.com\/4-things-local-businesses-should-know-about-over-the-top-tv-advertising\">Cox Media<\/a>, the growth rate for ad-supported streaming services in 2020 nearly doubled the growth rate for ad-free streaming services. The pandemic contributed to this, yes, but the trend continues. In fact,\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">OTT streaming increased by <span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.conviva.com\/WP_2021_Q1_State_of_Streaming_Success-Page.html\">115% in 2021<\/a><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\"> when compared to the previous years.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a result, many media providers are realizing the need to either start streaming content or come up with an ad-supported version of their service.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Consumers prefer ad-supported streaming<\/h3>\n<p>But consumers don&#8217;t like ads. So why are\u00a0ad-supported streaming services growing? Well, consumers are turning to streamed content just so they can watch video on demand. After all, you can do that with\u00a0cable\/satellite TV these days. It&#8217;s also to save money. So it makes sense that these &#8220;cord cutters,&#8221; as they&#8217;re called,\u00a0prefer seeing a few ads if it means free (or cheaper) content.<\/p>\n<p>And this was true even before the pandemic. A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/deloitte.wsj.com\/articles\/ad-supported-streaming-video-takes-off-01601924532\">Deloitte<\/a> study showed that 62% of consumers preferred less expensive (or free) ad-supported services over more expensive ad-free services.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"503a4ab0-6426-4071-a5ad-617d57cac7da\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-ott-advertising-deloitte-study-ad-supported-content.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\" alt=\"what is ott advertising - survey showing consumers prefer ad-supported content\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Even before COVID, 62% of consumers preferred the cheaper,\u00a0ad-supported streaming servicess.<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another and interesting fact is that according to Nielson, <a href=\"https:\/\/ottwatcher.com\/streaming-platforms-leading-the-way-in-on-screen-diverse-representation-nielsens-report\/\">streamed content is more diverse and inclusive<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>3. Better targeting<\/h3>\n<p>With traditional cable TV advertising, the only way to target is by choosing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.groundtruth.com\/glossary_term\/what-are-designated-market-areas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designated market area<\/a> (DMA). These are large regions (there are just 210 aross the entire U.S., meaning you&#8217;ll inevitably be reaching locations you don&#8217;t need (or want) to.\u00a0With OTT advertising, you can target:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zip codes (much like with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">PPC geotargeting<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Devices<\/li>\n<li>Demographics<\/li>\n<li>Behaviors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0fdce68e-81e6-4862-a857-d4724133153e\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-ott-advertising-dma-map.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"443\" alt=\"what is ott advertising - designated market area map\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/thevab.com\/storage\/app\/media\/Toolkit\/DMA_Map_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. OTT advertising works without third-party cookies<\/h3>\n<p>Not only is streamed content becoming more popular, but it also provides opportunities for cookieless targeting. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, there\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/29\/contextual-display-advertising\">contextual advertising<\/a>\u2014which does not require cookies because you\u2019re targeting categories of TV\/video content rather than individuals.<\/li>\n<li>Second, streaming subscription services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beet.tv\/2020\/11\/ott-platforms-point-way-for-cookie-less-future-tubis-mark-rotblat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collect a sufficient level of first-party data<\/a> from users (upon registration and logged-in activity) to allow for effective targeting. So you\u2019re using their first-party data without actually having access to it.<\/li>\n<li>Third, there are still ways to report on the effectiveness of your OTT ads using <a href=\"https:\/\/tinuiti.com\/blog\/data-privacy\/ott-advertising-targeting-and-measurement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IP addresses and timestamps.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/08\/google-floc\"><strong><em>Learn more about the deprecation of third-party cookies here.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. OTT video\u00a0ads have higher completion rates<\/h3>\n<p>Viewers cannot skip OTT ads, install ad blockers, or change the channel (they&#8217;re only on one), so the chances of your ad being watched all the way through are much higher. Yes, they could leave the room, but with consumers viewing content on mobile devices (on the train or in the car, for example), this is not an option. You might be concerned that this creates a poor experience for your audience, but remember, they prefer ad-supported content because they&#8217;re getting it for free. In other words, they know what they signed up for.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1551eb15-738a-43a9-a549-f9037860c1d8\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/OTT-advertising-meme.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" alt=\"what is OTT advertising - show on peacock\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6. Measure and optimize<\/h3>\n<p>If you deliver your OTT ads programmatically, you&#8217;ll be able to view performance analytics so you can understand what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. This way, you can do away with ineffective and money-wasting campaigns, make adjustments to improve existing campaigns, and scale your most successful campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Save money<\/h3>\n<p>With the targeting capabilities of OTT advertising, the higher completion rates, and the ability to measure and optimize, these types of\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/05\/video-ad-ideas\">video ads<\/a>\u00a0give\u00a0you plenty of opportunities to make the most of your budget and\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">maximize your advertising ROI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, it&#8217;s just one more component you can add to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">cross-channel marketing strategy<\/a>. Marketing across <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-cross-channel-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple channels<\/a>\u00a0helps to increase your brand awareness, and the more channels you have working together to enhance the others&#8217; performance, the more successful your overall paid media strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Is OTT advertising for local businesses?<\/h2>\n<p>While over-the-top advertising might seem like an advanced marketing strategy unfit for small or local businesses, the facts below just might change your mind.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s a better form of local TV advertising<\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, local TV advertising has been an effective marketing strategy for local businesses for years. OTT advertising is the same thing\u2014just with much better targeting and reporting. Remember, you can target by zip code if you want to.<\/p>\n<h3>Production costs may be lower<\/h3>\n<p>In addition, video ads on the internet have a different look and feel than video ads on traditional TV. So between stock video, animation, voiceovers, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/15\/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners\">easy video editing software<\/a>, you can create modern and appealing video ads\u00a0without having to film any footage whatsoever.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s not just for big brands<\/h3>\n<p>Most people don&#8217;t initially associate over-the-top or streamed advertising with small or local businesses, as it seems to be an advanced strategy only for the big brands. But keep in mind that OTT advertising includes\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/23\/youtube-advertising-tips\">YouTube advertising<\/a>, which can be done through the Google Ads platform. And even if you choose to advertise on other OTT networks, you can do so through a programmatic advertising provider.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e9123162-d0d5-457f-b88b-fecee7f59efb\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ott-advertising-phoebe.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"220\" alt=\"what is ott advertising- phoebe buffay meme\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Cord cutters prefer local OTT ads<\/h3>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https:\/\/streetfightmag.com\/2020\/01\/23\/ott-will-transform-how-local-businesses-connect-with-their-customers\/\">Street Fight article on the topic<\/a>, Ramandeep Ahuja, co-founder of ZypMedia shares that\u00a0a poll they ran\u00a0with The Harris Poll found that 62% of viewers of free or ad-supported streaming preferred local ads over national.

Target your personas<\/h3>\n<p>When you know your audience well, you can use language, images, and topics that resonate with the individuals in your audience. Be sure to consider all of your customer personas when coming up with OTT video ad scripts and ideas.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be relatable<\/h3>\n<p>For the most part, traditional TV commercial ads feel &#8220;distant&#8221; from us. We feel like a brand is advertising to us. With online video ads and personalized targeting, viewers expect more relatable and personable content.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Market with emotion<\/h3>\n<p>This is a best practice for any form of marketing, but video is the most effective medium for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">marketing with emotion<\/a>. Use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/01\/high-converting-landing-page-images\">emotional images<\/a>, emotional music, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional words<\/a>\u00a0to have a memorable and meaningful impact on your viewers. Can I say <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\">emotional<\/a> one more time? (Yes.)<\/p>\n<p>And yes, humor is an emotion.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"387cbedb-cb76-47f4-a82a-81b704233253\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ott-advertising-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"413\" alt=\"example of an OTT ad\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/quickframe.com\/blog\/creative-tips-ctv-ott-video-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Test and optimize<\/h3>\n<p>As you can see with\u00a0&#8220;Version A&#8221; in the example above, you should also A\/B test your OTT ads to identify which ones garner the most engagement. This is easy for YouTube ads since you manage them through Google Ads and can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/20\/youtube-studio-reports\">report on them via YouTube Studio<\/a>. However, as mentioned a few times in this post, you can easily manage and measure your OTT ads for other networks through programmatic delivery.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use voiceovers<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a best practice with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/14\/facebook-video-ad\">socia media video ads<\/a> to make it so that the message is communicated\u00a0without the sound on. This is true for OTT ads, but you also have to remember that even though people can&#8217;t skip your OTT ad, they can tune out, switch to a different device while it&#8217;s playing, or go in the other room. So it&#8217;s important to have voiceover in your ads that convey the message with sound, as this will still afford your brand some form of exposure to your viewer (and the mere exposure effect is one of many <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">psychological marketing effects<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h2>Does OTT advertising make more sense now? Let&#8217;s recap.<\/h2>\n<p><strong>What is OTT<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>OTT means over-the-top, because it is content that bypasses, or goes over the top of the set-top box (more familiarly known as the cable box).<\/li>\n<li>Over-the-top (streamed) content is delivered through an OTT streaming service, which can follow various models: TVOD (Google Play), AVOD (Hulu), SVOD (Netflix), or MPVD (Sling).<\/li>\n<li>OTT devices include smart phones, laptops, desktops, tablets, or connected TVs (which include smart TVs or any regular TV using an OTT stick (Roku) or gaming console (XBOX).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Why OTT advertising?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ad-supported streaming services are on the rise<\/li>\n<li>Consumers prefer ad-supported video content as it is the most cost-effective option.<\/li>\n<li>The number of ad-supported OTT households is set to surpass the number of pay TV households by 2024.<\/li>\n<li>Benefits of OTT advertising include targeting, analytics, cookieless advertising, and higher ROI.<\/li>\n<li>OTT advertising is a great marketing strategy for local businesses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tips for OTT video ads<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go with the programmatic method of OTT advertising as you can get the widest exposure at the lowest cost, and have insight into performance metrics.<\/li>\n<li>Get familiar with pricing models, such as per 1000 impressions, views, complete views, and hours\/seconds.<\/li>\n<li>Target your personas, market with emotion, be relatable, use voiceovers, and test and optimize.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of OTT is so close to us and yet so far away.
