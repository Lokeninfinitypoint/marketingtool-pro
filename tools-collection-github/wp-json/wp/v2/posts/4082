I need to be ahead of my competitors! I need to show up all the time for this keyword! I need to be in the top 3 or I won\u2019t be seen! Wrong, wrong, wrong, and, yes, wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Too many marketers and business owners react emotionally to Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords). Oddly enough, they have the data available to make accurate decisions, but they let their egos get in the way. Bidding to a specific position in Google Ads is B.S. There, I said it (Google Ads gurus freak out\u2026now). But\u2026I have data to back it up.<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/27\/google-sunsets-average-position\">average position<\/a> is a dependent variable. Here\u2019s why \u2013 your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversion rate<\/a> is not influenced by any of AdWords\u2019 metrics. Your click-through rate, average position, impression share, quality score etc. have no influence on your conversion rate. None. So what does this tell us? Your average positions need to be determined by your conversion rates and CPA goals and nothing else. You can\u2019t predetermine the output of the equation before solving the problem. In other words, bidding to position is an anecdotal guess, and why guess when you can be empirical? Time to debunk these myths with actual data.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dd4fe4d1-c079-40cb-9ede-d463a0bed20b\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dont-bid-to-position-1.jpg\" alt=\"bid to position myth\" width=\"1024\" height=\"527\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Myth: I need to be in position 1!<\/h2>\n<p>To be blunt, I hate this. My first question is, why? I understand this logic for your brand terms where your ROAS is 1000%, sure, you want to own that position. Aside from that, you should only own the top position if it is maximizing your profit. Period. There\u2019s no other reason to own it, unless your whole initiative is for branding, but I\u2019d advise against that, as there are much better branding options. If you\u2019re limited by budget, you\u2019ll actually get more clicks within your budget by bidding down, and if you\u2019re not limited by budget, and you don\u2019t have a killer ROI, then you are just letting your ego get in the way of your business sense.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through an example and data to illustrate. We\u2019ll use a basic <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/23\/get-more-leads-with-ppc\">lead generation<\/a> example, as e-commerce adds additional layers of complexity that I\u2019ll address later.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a car insurance broker in Boston, you should have a determined <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/16\/quality-score-cost-per-conversion\">cost per acquisition<\/a> goal to satisfy your business objectives. Let\u2019s use $100 per lead. You then need to look at your current conversion rate in your Google Ads\u00a0account and use that as a starting point, say 5%. Next, you will use this information to determine your Max CPC. Use this formula: Max CPA x Conversion Rate = Max CPC, $100 x 5% = $5. If you have enough data, you can, and should, determine this at the keyword level. From here, your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/16\/how-adwords-works\">ad rank is determined by this formula<\/a>: Max CPC x Quality Score = Ad Rank<\/p>\n<p>So what does this tell us about ad rank? First, let\u2019s look at the variables that affect ad rank in order of our ability to control them:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ad Extensions \u2013 Easiest to control and implement (negligible effect)<\/li>\n<li>Max CPC \u2013 Easy to control and implement, just a little more complex<\/li>\n<li>Quality Score \u2013 Moderate ability to control (CTR, Landing Pages, etc.), takes time, a number of different variables beyond control<\/li>\n<li>Competition \u2013 No Control<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>But again, <strong>these are all the variables that determine the ad position, not the other way around<\/strong>. So what this really tells us is that we need to control what is within our control, and your ad position will be the <strong>output<\/strong> not the <strong>input<\/strong>. Targeting a certain position without considering these factors is nothing but a bad guess.<\/p>\n<p>For e-commerce, there are whole host of other variables at play. But still, at the most fundamental level, the Max CPC formula still holds true. However, you will need to determine target CPAs based on another set of variables before arriving to the basic formula. These variables include, but are not limited to \u2013 Product Margin, Average Order Value, Return On Ad Spend, Lifetime Value, Landing Pages (Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youshouldtestthat.com\">www.youshouldtestthat.com<\/a> via Chris Goward <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrisgoward\">@chrisgoward<\/a> at ClickZ NYC). This perhaps is a topic for version 2 of this post, but these variables only further my point.<\/p>\n<p>Now, my point would be false if in fact the claims I\u2019ve heard countless times about ad rank were true, but they aren\u2019t. You do not convert clicks more in position 3 because \u201cpeople read these ads\u201d and, no, you aren\u2019t proving you\u2019re the best in position 1, and enticing people by \u201cbeating\u201d your competition. <strong>The truth is that there is no correlation between ad rank and conversion rate. <\/strong>Your conversion rate is the same in position 1 as is in position 3.<\/p>\n<p>In the regression below, you can see that average conversion rate remains flat regardless of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/14\/goodbye-average-position\">average position<\/a>, R squared = 0.002, suggesting no correlation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c0423b37-48e5-43a6-959d-04f88c1da1f5\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/conversion-rate-by-ad-position-myth-1.png\" alt=\"adwords conversion rates by position\" width=\"942\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Of course, being in low positions will cause your volume to be limited, but you need to look at other factors beyond your bid before you decide to push up in position. What then can you control? Your offer, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>, price, the UX of your site, quality score (to an extent), and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/09\/adwords-tips-for-seasonal-businesses\">seasonality<\/a> are good places to start. <strong>You need to get these factors under control before you go after top positions, not the other way around.<\/strong> If you\u2019re aggressive and willing to accept a higher CPA to test, then sure, go for it to collect data, but if you have a strict CPA goal that leads you to profitability, you simply can\u2019t play in a position that is out of your price range if you want to hit your goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Myth: I need to show up all the time for this keyword!<\/h2>\n<p>This same argument then holds true for impression share. To illustrate this point, let\u2019s revisit our previous example. We\u2019ve determined that our Max CPC can only be $5 based on our target CPA and conversion rate. Car insurance brokers in Boston often see an average CPC of $40+. Your $5 Max CPC bid will likely gain you &lt;10% impression share, meaning you\u2019ll be lucky to grab a click a day.<\/p>\n<p>So what is the solution here? Bid up to first page? <strong>No.<\/strong> Be seen in the top 3? <strong>No.<\/strong> You may be tempted to push your impression share higher, as you\u2019re currently losing 90% of your potential impressions due to ad rank (i.e. your competition). As John Gagnon (Bing Ads Evangelist @jmgagnon) shared at the ClickZ conference in NYC, if you see \u201c% Lost due to bid\u201d in Bing or in Google\u2019s language \u201cImpression Share lost due to ad rank,\u201d your bid might not be high enough to even enter the <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">auctions<\/a> you want to be in. What John said makes total sense. My challenge to marketers then is not can you pay to be in the game, but rather, <strong>is your offer even good enough to be in the game?<\/strong> Increasing your impression share won\u2019t improve your conversion rate. So, throwing money at your bids to attract more volume will only cause you to close your business doors before ever being competitive. In this regression, we see no correlation between conversion rate and impression share.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"924e5474-ddaf-4330-b1fd-439dbfb4c1a2\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/impression-share-conversion-rate-myth-1.png\" alt=\"conversion rate vs impression share\" width=\"942\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Myth: I need to be in the top 3 or I won\u2019t be seen!<\/h2>\n<p>Two things are important here. First, people click on ads below position 3. A client of mine had 43,000 clicks last month in average position 4.4. Second, average position doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re always in that specific position. There can actually be high variance here, and your positioning may actually look something like this for an average position of 3.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f23aadd5-5e2b-46ad-8493-89e476a77418\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/average-position-impression-share-1.png\" alt=\"adwords myths\" width=\"614\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Yes, your volume begins to drop as your average position declines, but if you\u2019re in a big volume space (e.g. travel), you can get the volume you need. If you\u2019re in a low volume space (e.g. local dentist), a low position may only drive a handful of clicks a day. But again, you need to get your offer right unless you just want to burn your cash.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the big takeaway? <strong>Don\u2019t bid to position, bid to profitability.<\/strong> Stop listening to your ego and the Google Ads gurus, and start listening to what your data tells you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Should you bid into top positions to increase your conversion rate?
