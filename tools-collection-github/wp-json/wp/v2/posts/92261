I\u2019ve been using them ever since they launched and have seen great results for all kinds of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>A common struggle I hear is that people can set up and launch Facebook lead generation campaigns, but they\u2019re unsure how to optimize them afterward. While every business is different, you likely fit into one of two categories when trying to optimize your Facebook lead ads. You either want more leads or higher lead quality.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll talk about strategies that can help you achieve whatever you\u2019re interested in, as well as some best practices for everyone to pay attention to.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-ad-text-creative\">Focus on your ad text and creative<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type\">Choose the right form type<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-intro\">Create a form introduction that pops<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-question-strategy\">Add the right questions to your form<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#master-lead-follow-up-strategy\">Have a strong lead follow up strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-overview\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to optimize Facebook lead ads<\/h2>\n<p>Use these five<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Facebook lead ad optimization strategies<\/a> to help your business source more high-quality leads from<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the Meta Ads platform<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-ad-text-creative\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Focus on your ad text and creative<\/h3>\n<p>Before we get to the form itself, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/facebook-lead-ad-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your Facebook lead ad copy and creative<\/a> are an important starting place. This is the impression you\u2019re going to make on your audience, and it needs to align with your optimization goal.<\/p>\n<h4>Facebook lead ad copy and creative tips for everyone<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use highly engaging visuals<\/strong>: This could be for static images, carousels, or video. Make sure you\u2019re standing out from the crowd.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make the most of your copy<\/strong>: Use emojis or numbers in text to stand out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test different text lengths<\/strong>: All industries and customer personas are different. Some want longer copy, others want something more succinct. Test different permutations and see what works best for your folks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use vibrant, contrasting colors<\/strong>: More often than not, the ads I see work best have some sort of high contrast in the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/website-color-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> color scheme<\/a>. This creates a harsh experience that can often get users to stop scrolling and see what your ad is about.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Format creatives for each placement size<\/strong>: There are lots of different placements on the Meta network, and they let you upload custom creatives for each. There\u2019s no reason you should deal with dead space around the top and bottom, or sides of your visual assets. Try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-image-prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using AI to create and upload images or videos<\/a> that fit each dimension for each placement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Use the power of AI to optimize your Facebook lead ads<\/strong> with our free guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key ways to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h4>How to adjust your Facebook assets for higher lead volume<\/h4>\n<p>To get more form fills, you need more people clicking on your ads. To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve click-through rate<\/a>, try some of these tactics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make your ads broadly appealing<\/strong>: Try to strike a tone of \u201call are welcome.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Change your offer<\/strong>: Test different things to give away. What does your audience want the most that you\u2019re willing to \u201cgive away\u201d? If you\u2019re not seeing the volume you want, you might need to have something more appealing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Play on your audience&#8217;s emotions<\/strong>: If someone is going to work with you, are they happy, sad, fearful? While I would suggest you use some level of discretion so as not to be manipulative, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using emotion<\/a> in ads can get users to engage and convert more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use social proof or industry awards:<\/strong> Showcase yourself through either reviews from your customers or awards you\u2019ve won for your business. These help you differentiate yourselves from your competition and show that others think your products or services are high value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>How to optimize your Facebook ad copy and creative for better lead quality<\/h4>\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-quality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher-quality leads<\/a>, our tactics need to be a bit different. We still want highly attractive and engaging creatives, but there are some tweaks on the theme to attract only the right users. The biggest thing to remember with tactics to improve lead quality is that you\u2019ll almost always see less overall lead volume, but your percentage of high-quality leads should be better, bringing up your batting average.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tell your audience who you\u2019re a good fit for:<\/strong> Speak only to the users you want to engage with. If your product only works for certain groups of people, call that out. Have a minimum spend on our site that lower budget folks can\u2019t afford? Make that known.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Incorporate your ideal persona in creatives<\/strong>: Don&#8217;t stop at ad text. If you\u2019re able to visually showcase your actual target audience, do that in the imagery.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Change your offer to fit a narrower one<\/strong>: Move away from the \u201ceveryone is welcome\u201d offer and promote something only a serious buyer would want.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Choose the right form type<\/h3>\n<p>Whenever you build a new lead gen form on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Ads<\/a>, the first choice you have is what type of form you want to use. There are two choices for this: <strong>more volume<\/strong> and <strong>higher intent<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook lead ads - form type screenshot\" width=\"849\" height=\"267\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92265 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp 849w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type-480x151.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>More volume Facebook lead ad forms<\/h4>\n<p>The \u201cmore volume\u201d option is going to align perfectly with anyone trying to get a higher number of lead-gen forms submitted to their campaigns. This form, as Meta says, is quick to fill out and submit on a mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>There are almost no breakpoints with these forms (the only exception would be with your question strategy, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute). These should be free-flowing and easy to zip right through.<\/p>\n<h4>Higher quality Facebook lead ad forms<\/h4>\n<p>While the options for this form are almost identical to the more volume option, a &#8220;higher Intent&#8221; form adds a step in the form submission process that acts as a speed bump for the user.<\/p>\n<p>During this review step, the user can see their information based on the answers they provided to the questions and is reminded that the information they see is going to be submitted to your business. Additionally, the user has to slide the submit arrow rather than simply clicking a Submit button. A subtle change, but a meaningful one.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp\" alt=\"optimize facebook lead ads - user answer review options\" width=\"850\" height=\"409\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92271 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-480x231.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This review step, while fairly basic, does a good job of reminding the user what this form is for and scaring off users who are less serious about engaging with a company. Just like I warned above, you\u2019ll likely see fewer form fills with a higher intent form type, but the users who do submit should be higher quality since they were given the option to back out and didn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-intro\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Create a form intro section that pops<\/h3>\n<p>The intro of a lead gen form gives even more text space for you to set the stage for your potential customers. Think of this greeting in much the same way you thought about the ad copy and creative itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udea8\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Looking for more ways to improve your Facebook lead ads?<\/strong> Start with an instant account report using our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h4>Facebook lead ad form greeting tips for everyone<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using the ad image is fine: <\/strong>If you have the design capabilities and bandwidth and want to design new images for the forms, that\u2019s great. They likely will perform really well. But I\u2019ve been using the same image from the ads for a long time and haven\u2019t seen any slowdown in performance because of it. We talk a lot about making sure your ads look their best in all placements, and this is one of them, but this is likely one of the few scenarios that you can let it slide.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook lead ads - background image for form intro\" width=\"711\" height=\"361\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92266 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp 711w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads--480x244.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Set the stage in the greeting<\/strong>: Let the user know who they\u2019re engaging with and what they\u2019ll receive in return once they fill out the form. This should be a continuation of the messaging in your ad creative, but you get more of an opportunity to talk to your prospective customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook lead ads - form greeting\" width=\"705\" height=\"501\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92267 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp 705w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ad-tips-480x341.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>How to make your Facebook lead ad form intro appeal to more people<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re aiming for more volume, the best thing you can do in this section is to echo the same \u201call are welcome\u201d message you used in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, if you\u2019re really trying to limit the friction in your lead gen forms, you could test not using the greeting text at all and sticking only with the image. There\u2019s a blue toggle in the upper right of the greeting where you can turn it off, and users will go straight from the image to the form fields.<\/p>\n<h4>How to make your form greeting attract more high-quality leads<\/h4>\n<p>To improve lead quality, I suggest you use the greeting every time and use it to further prequalify your customers. Keep adding information that will help weed out the users who are less serious and focus only on those with higher intent.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-question-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Add the right questions to your form<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve got the form type down, the biggest differentiator in optimizing your Facebook lead ads is going to be the questions you add to your forms. Everything matters in this section, from the types of questions you ask to the substance of them. Note: Only ask for relevant information!\u00a0No matter your end goal, keep your questions focused on data points that are most important for you to know or helpful to your sales teams. Don\u2019t get distracted.<\/p>\n<h4>Optimize your Facebook lead ad form questions for increased lead volume<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on the prefill questions:<\/strong> All questions in this section will be auto-filled by Meta if it knows the information based on someone\u2019s profile information. By using these questions, you\u2019ll limit the work your audience has to do to fill out the form since there\u2019s a higher likelihood of the information populating for them in the form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask fewer questions:<\/strong> The fewer questions you ask (or the less amount of information you ask for), the better chance you\u2019ll see an increase in volume. Depending on your business, you might be able to get away with only a first name and phone number or a name and email. Even a form with two fields can be valuable if you have the right follow-up in place.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep the information high level:<\/strong> Using prefill questions can help, but the less invasive you are in the form, the more likely you are to get users to fill it out. If your sales team is willing and able to get the other needed information out of the customers on the phone, then keep it simple here and let them do their thing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp\" alt=\"optimize facebook leads - contact field option\" width=\"733\" height=\"666\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92264 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp 733w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form-480x436.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Try question strategies to get higher-quality leads<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019re gonna take pretty much everything from the \u201cmore volume\u201d section here and turn it on its head.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leverage the custom questions:<\/strong> Make the user think about their answer and type something in, or make a choice. Everything in the questions section is going to require you to craft the question and provide the space for the answers. Or, in the case of multiple choice, you get to select the possible answers too.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp\" alt=\"optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic\" width=\"803\" height=\"367\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92268 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp 803w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic-480x219.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask more questions:<\/strong> Follow the best practice of keeping all questions relevant, but ask for more in the form. Users who are less serious won\u2019t want to take the time to answer five or more questions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get the details in the form:<\/strong> Do the job of a salesperson. Ask about the budget, timeline, and other important details right in the form. The serious buyer knows this information is necessary for you to do your job, so they\u2019re willing to share it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leverage conditional logic:<\/strong> In the first image of this section, you can see there\u2019s a toggle in the upper right for conditional logic. With this activated, you can choose how the form will react based on how the user interacts with it. You can either send them a follow-up question, complete and submit the form, or send the user to an end page and not submit the form. This lets you create an entire experience directly in the form and allows them to choose the next step.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give the user an out:<\/strong> While it might seem strange to let people opt out of submitting the form, it\u2019s actually in your best interest. Many times, forms get opened by accident, and the user isn\u2019t sure how they got there. In your questions, specifically multiple choice, give the option (or something similar to) \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d then send the user to an end screen. They\u2019re let off the hook in a nice way, and your sales team isn\u2019t reaching out to folks who don\u2019t want to talk to them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic.webp\" alt=\"optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic option\" width=\"837\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92270 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic.webp 837w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic-480x233.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 837px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"master-lead-follow-up-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Master your lead follow up<\/h3>\n<p>Your job isn\u2019t finished once you receive someone\u2019s form. It\u2019s on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/03\/lead-nurturing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> your nurture sequences<\/a> and sales team to close the leads that are coming through from your campaigns. For this stage, we don\u2019t really have any different strategies for volume or quality plays, but here are some overall best practices that you should be doing when you generate leads through Meta Ads.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offer a timely follow-up:<\/strong> As crazy as it sounds, if you\u2019re not following up with your lead gen form submissions within about 24-48 hours, they\u2019re likely going to forget they interacted with you in the first place. Be sure to reach out as soon as possible to keep the user engaged with your company, whether it\u2019s through an email nurture sequence or a sales call follow-up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make the next step logical and meaningful<\/strong>: Speaking of that next step, make sure it\u2019s the right fit for your initial call to action. Someone who downloaded an infographic likely doesn\u2019t want to talk to a salesperson right away. On the flip side, someone who opted for a demo likely doesn\u2019t want to get tons of content from you right away. Use your follow-up to further the conversation with the potential customer in a logical way; don\u2019t jump around the funnel too much.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remove users after a period of time<\/strong>: Regardless of how interested they were when they filled out the form, there are going to be people who simply don\u2019t want to engage anymore for one reason or another. Set up safeguards to remove people from sales call sheets and email nurtures after a certain amount of time with no activity. It\u2019ll save your team&#8217;s time and not leave a bad taste in the potential customer\u2019s mouth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Optimizing your Facebook lead ads can be easier than you think<\/h2>\n<p>No matter what your goals are, there are plenty of strategies you can use to improve the performance of your lead generation campaigns on Meta Ads.
