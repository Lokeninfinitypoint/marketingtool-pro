Yet.<\/p>\n<h2>What is The Feed?<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, the feed is Google\u2019s answer to Facebook\u2019s News Feed and Twitter\u2019s, well, Twitter-ness.<\/p>\n<p>A reality: <strong>Search is all about intent.<\/strong> This positions Google as the apex ad platform, a place where advertisers can reach prospects at any point during the sales cycle based on the words typed (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">or spoken<\/a>) by those prospects. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">The ROI is awesome<\/a> because you&#8217;re only bidding on terms that show intent relevant to your wares.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to news, though, people prefer a little bit of serendipity. Google doesn\u2019t really <em>do<\/em> serendipity. Sorry, <em>didn\u2019t do<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"00588758-181d-4ec2-ae51-b057c84f67c1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-feed-serendipity-2.png\" alt=\"google feed brings serendipity to search\" width=\"738\" height=\"467\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per Google, the feed\u2019s goal is to make it \u201ceasier than ever to discover, explore and stay connected to what matters to you\u2014even when you don\u2019t have a query in mind.\u201d How does it accomplish this? The cards in your feed are \u201cnot only based on your interactions with Google, but also factors in what\u2019s trending in your area and around the world. The more you use Google, the better your feed will be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Incentivized activity? Limitless utility? Tell me that isn\u2019t the foundation for a new revenue stream and I\u2019ll never believe another word you say.<\/p>\n<p>Before I get to the speculation about how the feed-as-ad-platform might exist, some credit where credit is due.<\/p>\n<h2>The Feed: The First Step Towards A Balanced Media Diet<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike Twitter (where I get most of my news), the feed can grow and evolve <em>without<\/em> exacerbating the curated media <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/11\/filter-bubble-destroying-democracy\/\">echo chambers in which the majority of us reside<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Again, here\u2019s Google: \u201cTo provide information from diverse perspectives, news stories may have multiple viewpoints from a variety of sources, as well as other related information and articles.
