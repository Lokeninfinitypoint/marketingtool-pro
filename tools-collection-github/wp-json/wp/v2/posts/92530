Determine the topic(s) for your newsletter<\/h3>\n<p>Your newsletter is your chance to build a strong, meaningful connection with your customers. For small businesses, it is a unique opportunity to stay in front of customers without navigating social media and search engine algorithms, where they have to compete against some of the biggest brands. <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-trends-2025\/\">Email marketing<\/a> puts you on a level playing field, and it\u2019s only up to your creativity whether you\u2019ll get noticed.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s not about selling every second. You need to offer value to your customers.

Draft a hook-worthy introduction<\/h3>\n<p>Once subscribers open your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-checklist\/\">email marketing newsletter<\/a>, the introduction or hook is your chance to grab their attention from the get-go. Whether you use a bold statement, a surprising fact, or an intriguing question, make it something that piques readers\u2019 curiosity and makes them think, \u201cI need to know more.\u201d You can also use humor as a way to show your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a> and make your newsletter more relatable.<\/p>\n<p>But remember: the introduction is setting the tone for what\u2019s next. If your intro promises something exciting, your content better deliver.<\/p>\n<div id=\"close-out-with-a-strong-call-to-action\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Close out with a strong call to action<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve created the perfect hook with the introduction and your newsletter content is exciting and engaging\u2014great job! The question the reader has is: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d If you don\u2019t provide a clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a>, you leave readers hanging.<\/p>\n<p>To capitalize on the momentum, make sure you use a strong call to action. Whether checking out a product, reading a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/06\/irresistible-blog-post-titles\">blog post<\/a>, or signing up for an event, make it clear and easy to follow.<\/p>\n<p>When announcing their new collection, Cotopaxi used a straightforward call to action for subscribers to sign up and get early access. If you have a goal in mind you want to achieve, don\u2019t overwhelm customers with different calls to action.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-call-to-action-example.webp\" alt=\"newsletter call to action example\" width=\"478\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93046\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-call-to-action-example.webp 478w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-call-to-action-example-205x300.webp 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Need help creating click-worthy CTAs?<\/strong> Free guide download\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"add-in-graphics-and-the-right-layout\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Add in graphics and the right layout<\/h3>\n<p>We live in a visual world, and people are visual creatures. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2014\/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MIT research<\/a> shows that the human brain processes images in 13 to 33 milliseconds, 60,000 times faster than text. Graphics and layout add a visual punch to your newsletter\u2019s content. They\u2019re what make it scroll-worthy and not just another wall of text.<\/p>\n<p>Graphics can help you break things up, highlight key points, or add personality. The right mix of text and visuals can guide your reader\u2019s eyes, keep them engaged, and help your message hit home without overwhelming them. Focus on simple, smart design, and expect more clicks and a bigger impact.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/user-generated-content\">User-generated content<\/a> or authentic-looking visuals can be a great way to make your brand feel real. People can tell when something\u2019s been overly staged or looks too \u201cperfect.\u201d Authentic visuals make your brand feel more relatable and down-to-earth, which is exactly the vibe you want if you\u2019re building trust.<\/p>\n<p>Take BANGS shoes, for example. They use natural-looking visuals that give the person-next-door vibe. Their messaging is aligned with their visuals\u2014focusing on the small things, staying true to yourself, and being unique.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-example-graphics.webp\" alt=\"newsletter example with graphics\" width=\"346\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93045\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-example-graphics.webp 346w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-example-graphics-115x300.webp 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"choose-a-compelling-subject-line\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Choose a compelling subject line<\/h3>\n<p>The subject line serves as your virtual doormat. It\u2019s the first thing people see when they receive your email. If you don\u2019t get the subject line right, everything else becomes a waste of time because your newsletter will end up in the trash or stuck in the pile of emails left unread.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line<\/a> click-worthy? A solid email subject line should sum up the key message, the value, or the point of the email in a way that makes people want to click. Easier said than done, though, right? Here are some best practices to help you write attention-grabbing subject lines for your newsletter.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it short.<\/strong> Data shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/audiencepoint.com\/what-percentage-of-emails-are-opened-on-mobile-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50-60%<\/a> of email opens come from mobile devices. So, if you want to convey the right message, no matter the device the readers are using, keep your subject lines short.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use emojis (carefully).<\/strong> When done right, using emojis in your subject lines can grab attention and add personality. Today, emojis are an integral part of people\u2019s communication, which makes them relatable. The best part? They are great at triggering emotions. But remember, you should use them strategically and not overdo them. For some brands, such as Drunk Elephant, emojis are part of the brand personality, which makes them instantly pop up in the inbox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-subject-line-emojis.webp\" alt=\"newsletter subject line with emojis\" width=\"900\" height=\"556\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-subject-line-emojis.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-subject-line-emojis-480x297.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spark curiosity.<\/strong> Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it\u2019s what gets your newsletter opened. Tease just enough to make people wonder what\u2019s inside, but don\u2019t give it all away. But be careful\u2014you have to find the right balance. Readers will think they\u2019re getting clickbait if you make it too cryptic. Keep it intriguing, not frustrating.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use A\/B testing.<\/strong> There\u2019s no shortcut or secret formula for a good-performing subject line. To find what works for your newsletter subscribers, test different variations, wording, length, or emojis, and see which gets the best response. The jewelry brand Maison Miru frequently uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/11\/copywriting-ab-tests\">A\/B testing<\/a> for different subject lines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ab-test-newsletter-copy.webp\" alt=\"newsletter a\/b test example\" width=\"730\" height=\"694\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93044\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ab-test-newsletter-copy.webp 730w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ab-test-newsletter-copy-480x456.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 730px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"add-intriguing-preview-text\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Add intriguing preview text<\/h3>\n<p>The preview text is one of the most underrated elements of a newsletter, and it\u2019s often either left out or filled in with random text. And let\u2019s not forget the frequently used \u201cview this email in your browser.\u201d Preview text is like the backstage pass to your email\u2013it\u2019s the little teaser that gives people a sneak peek at what&#8217;s inside. If your subject line got them curious, the preview text is your chance to seal the deal. Be clever, compelling, and make it count.<\/p>\n<p>The Sill, a house plant delivery brand, uses newsletter preview text to create a sense of urgency and give readers a glimpse of what to expect. You can spot them using preview text such as \u201cjust days left to save\u201d or \u201climited stock available\u201d to urge plant lovers to seize the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill.webp\" alt=\"newsletter preview text example from the sill\" width=\"900\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93048\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill-480x187.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"close-out-with-your-footer-elements\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Close out with your footer elements<\/h3>\n<p>The footer of your newsletter is the last thing people see, but it\u2019s also your last chance to engage. Unfortunately, many small businesses treat the footer as an afterthought rather than a prime real estate for reinforcing your brand and giving readers other ways to connect with you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the essential elements of a newsletter footer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contact details:<\/strong> Include an email, physical address, or both, so people know how they can reach out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email preferences\/Unsubscribe link:<\/strong> You are legally obliged to include the unsubscribe link. So, if people want to opt out, make it easy for them to do so.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Legal disclaimers:<\/strong> If you have any legal disclaimers, especially for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/promotion-ideas\">promotional newsletters<\/a>, include them in the footer to ensure compliance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media links:<\/strong> Give readers another way to connect with you and stay in the loop on your updates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The footer of your newsletter doesn\u2019t need to be boring. Take Smalls, the fresh human-grade cat food delivery brand, for example. They use the footer to add all the necessary elements while being playful and engaging. Even more important, they make it easy to reach out to them, whether through text or email.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-footer-example.webp\" alt=\"newsletter footer example\" width=\"489\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93049\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-footer-example.webp 489w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-footer-example-480x589.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 489px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"best-practices-for-stand-out-newsletters\"><\/div>\n<h2>Bonus: 6 tips and best practices for newsletters that stand out<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered all the key elements, it\u2019s time to share tips and best practices to help you create an outstanding newsletter.<\/p>\n<div id=\"send-personalized-newsletters\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Send personalized newsletters<\/h3>\n<p>According to Ascend2, email comes out on top when it comes to the digital channels seeing the most impact from personalization, with about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingcharts.com\/customer-centric\/personalization-customer-centric-224553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 in 10 (62%)<\/a> of marketers saying so. Personalization is more than just using someone\u2019s name at the top. It\u2019s about making customers feel like you get them.<\/p>\n<p>From recommending products based on past purchases to sending content aligned with their interests, personalization makes your readers feel seen. The skincare and beauty brand Tatcha collects birthday information when subscribers sign up for its newsletter. They use the information to offer customers a birthday discount on their next purchase.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha.webp\" alt=\"birthday newsletter example from tatcha\" width=\"519\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93050\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha.webp 519w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha-480x647.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 519px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 <strong>Get copywriting psychology insights in our free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download\">25+ Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"take-customers-behind-the-scenes\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Take customers behind the scenes<\/h3>\n<p>Behind-the-scenes content is your golden ticket to turning your product from a faceless item into something people can connect with. Show them how the magic happens\u2013whether it\u2019s the design process, the craftsmanship, or the people behind it all. People love knowing the story behind what they\u2019re buying, and letting them in on the process makes them feel like they\u2019re part of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>The furniture and accessories brand Swoon Editions did this by showing the step-by-step process of making one of their most iconic designs, the Ziggy cabinet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example.webp\" alt=\"newsletter behind the scenes example\" width=\"496\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93051\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example.webp 496w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example-480x677.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 496px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"use-quizzes-to-engage-subscribers\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

A well-designed quiz can give people a reason to open your email, click around, and learn more about your products or services in a way that feels interactive.<\/p>\n<p>The best part: you get valuable insights into your readers&#8217; preferences and behaviors, which gives you a goldmine of information to personalize your next newsletter. The skincare and beauty products brand Bliss uses a quiz to help subscribers find the perfect product for their routine.

Create a freebie<\/h3>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love free stuff? Offering a freebie, whether it\u2019s a downloadable guide, an exclusive discount, or a sneak peek of something new, is a great way to add value and keep your readers coming back for more. Moreover, this will boost engagement and get people excited about what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p>Gainful, a personalized and curated sports nutrition supplements brand, has created a cookbook with recipes for healthy meals and snacks that include its products.

Use storytelling<\/h3>\n<p>If you want people to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/marketing-newsletters\">subscribe to and engage with your newsletter<\/a>, don\u2019t share just promotions and limited-time deals. People want a story they can connect with. Small business owners have the best stories. So why not share them with your readers? Whether it&#8217;s how your company started, a customer success story, or the journey behind a product, a good story humanizes your brand and makes readers care.<\/p>\n<p>The superfoods brand, NoonBrew shared a personal story from its creative director about her struggles with insomnia. A well-told story creates an emotional hook that keeps people reading and makes them more connected to the brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-storytelling-example.webp\" alt=\"newsletter storytelling example\" width=\"255\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93054\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-storytelling-example.webp 255w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/newsletter-storytelling-example-109x300.webp 109w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"involve-subscribers-and-offer-an-incentive\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Involve subscribers and offer an incentive<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t make your newsletter a one-way street. Use it to build relationships with your customers.
