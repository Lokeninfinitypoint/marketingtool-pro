So, let\u2019s get to it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-create-a-social-media-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to create a social media strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019re clear on what a social media strategy is and why it\u2019s important, let\u2019s get into the steps to create one of your own. Here are the essentials for developing a social media strategy that works for you and your business.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write your mission statement<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re likely familiar with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a> for a business. It\u2019s a concise, clear statement of the brand\u2019s purpose, values, and goals. But documenting this guiding principle for your marketing is worthwhile, too.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/11\/content-marketing-mission-statement\">content marketing mission statement<\/a>, start your social media strategy doc by crafting one that\u2019s specific to these channels. Here are a few questions to help you get started brainstorming:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is your social media content funny or formal?<\/li>\n<li>Is your personality quirky, irreverent, or all business?<\/li>\n<li>How does your social media content relate to other marketing channels?<\/li>\n<li>What type of content do you share on your social accounts?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And when you\u2019ve got all your answers down, use this formula to start drafting:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>[Your brand]\u2019s social media presence is where [your target social audience] can find [type of content] and [other type of content] for [benefit].\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Developing a concise statement that defines your social media content and why it matters will also help you with the rest of your strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Set your goals<\/h3>\n<p>Your time, efforts, and budget are all valuable and limited resources. For your social media strategy to be effective, you need to put those resources to the best use for specific goals. In <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/data\/harris-insights-report-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 2023 State of Social Media Marketing<\/a>, Buffer reported the top three <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media marketing objectives<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building brand reputation (selected by 66% of survey respondents).<\/li>\n<li>Understanding customers (65%).<\/li>\n<li>Improving competitive positioning (63%).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are great places to start if you\u2019re unsure what you\u2019d like to get from your brand\u2019s social media presence. Once you have your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-objectives-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">objective<\/a>, it\u2019s time to set some goals. SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1.webp\" alt=\"Social media strategy - SMART goal visual.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88059\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, if your following on TikTok hovers around 1,000 and you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/20\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok\">posting regularly<\/a>, a good goal for building brand awareness could be to get 250 more followers on the platform by the end of the quarter.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, this strategy is meant to focus your social media efforts and ensure you get the results you need without wasting your time. So, keep this part simple if it makes sense for your time or your company. Think more followers, posts, and engagement\u2014and these can be incremental gains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc40 Free Guide! &gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Find &amp; Define Your Target Audience<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Define your audience<\/h3>\n<p>You need to define your audience to grow your followers and engage with your community. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-audience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target audience<\/a> on social media is a part of your company\u2019s target audience, so a good place to start with this step is pulling out your buyer personas and mapping these to your social.<\/p>\n<p>Which platforms do each persona spend time on? What type of content does each persona engage with? This will be a good starting point for defining your audience and brainstorming content.<\/p>\n<p>But your brand\u2019s target audience isn\u2019t a direct translation of your social media\u2019s target audience. Your persona, endearingly referred to as Brad the Builder, never goes on TikTok, for instance. Why make a bunch of videos with him in mind? That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful to go one step further.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve aligned your channels with buyer personas, look at your followers on each platform and figure out patterns. Do the people following your account have similar ages or job titles? What about their educational backgrounds or geographic locations?\u00a0 This will help you hone in on your target audience\u2014and hopefully even develop your own social media personas for content creation.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Audit your accounts<\/h3>\n<p>Before you get any further in your planning, you need to take the time to do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-audit\">social media audit<\/a>. This should be comprehensive, but it doesn\u2019t need to be an exhausting endeavor.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where to focus your social media audit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confirm you have access to all of your accounts:<\/strong> First things first, make sure you have up-to-date credentials for your social media accounts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Review your profiles:<\/strong> Are the cover and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/linkedin-banner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banner photos<\/a> on brand and high res? Is pinned content relevant? Are you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide\">optimized for search<\/a>? Make sure this is all set.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dive into your audience:<\/strong> Note everything you learned from reviewing your audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get familiar with your performance: <\/strong>Check your analytics for patterns, identify content that works well, and remember anything that regularly tanks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This gives you a baseline understanding of your social media performance so that you can focus on growing.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Check out your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have a handle on how your own social media is working, you need to figure out the landscape. Check out your major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">competitors<\/a> and do a similar audit. Sure, you don\u2019t have access to all the analytics, but you can still see follower counts, posting schedule, and engagement metrics, including likes, shares, and comments. What\u2019s working well? What do you like? What isn\u2019t getting engagement?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop.webp\" alt=\"Social media strategy - examples of two soda brands' marketing.\" width=\"455\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88060 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop.webp 455w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop-233x300.webp 233w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop-400x516.webp 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can bet that competitors like Poppi and Olipop keep tabs on each other\u2019s social profiles.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Then, use all this information to inform your content planning, leading us to the next step in your social media strategy.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want an in-depth look at what your competitors are doing online?<\/strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Plan your content pillars<\/h3>\n<p>Content pillars are themes or topics that your account will consistently create social media content about. That includes new posts, re-shares to amplify other posts, and reactions to trending stories related to these topics.<\/p>\n<p>The topics will be specific to your brand, but there are several common types of content pillars.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Educational:<\/strong> This content will teach your audience about your niche. Think breakdowns of your expert knowledge in videos, posts, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-threads\">Threads<\/a>. Remember, this should be about your area of expertise, not directly about your product or offering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entertaining:<\/strong> Think memes, gifs, and trend videos for entertaining content. With this type of content, you want your audience to pause scrolling, notice your brand, and even laugh and follow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Promotional:<\/strong> Your product tutorials, case studies, testimonials, and new release updates are all examples of promotional content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engaging:<\/strong> This type of content includes direct engagement with your audience. Think about conversations with followers, response videos to comments, and user-generated content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you try to post all of the types of content we just covered in the table above, you\u2019d be busy\u2014and your social media profiles would look scattered.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth the time to designate content pillars. This focus will help you more easily brainstorm and create content, identify trending stories to engage with, and find complementary accounts to engage with online. And by staying consistent, you\u2019ll let your audience know what to expect by following your brand. This will help with brand recognition, the first step to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/brand-loyalty\">brand loyalty<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy.webp\" alt=\"Social media strategy -Social media post from Maha.\" width=\"824\" height=\"590\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88061 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy.webp 824w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy-480x344.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A great example of educational content from <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C8rwU0-OLI3\/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Maha Copy<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When coming up with these content pillars, remember to choose topics relevant to your brand and your audience.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re running a small marketing agency. For educational content, you might want to focus on copywriting for your expert tips and create content around this. And for the engaging category, you might run a weekly AMA \u201coffice hours\u201d where your followers submit marketing challenges and you give your on-the-spot advice. This helps you know where to focus your efforts, and it helps your audience know what to expect.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Document your tone and voice guide<\/h3>\n<p>Content pillars help develop consistency that makes your brand and social media content more recognizable. A clear tone and voice guide will help with this, too, by ensuring you maintain your distinct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings.webp\" alt=\"Social media strategy -Funny social media post.\" width=\"442\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88062 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings.webp 442w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings-221x300.webp 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Is your brand serious, studious, or silly?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your guide can include how you capitalize and punctuate posts, what types of slang or casual language you use, and even key terms to use regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your tone will shift slightly across your platforms. For instance, your brand account on LinkedIn should sound more professional than your brand account on TikTok or Snapchat. If you want to include these platform-specific differentiations in your tone and voice guide, all the better.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Settle on your core channels<\/h3>\n<p>Your social media strategy needs to identify the platforms on which your brand will be active. But you don\u2019t need to post with the same frequency everywhere. Focus on your core channels instead.<\/p>\n<p>You might need to do some work to figure out which should be your core channels. Consider where you have the most followers, where your competitors are most active, and where your target customers spend most of their time. Then, once you\u2019ve identified your primary channels, you can turn your attention to setting a schedule and brainstorming content. In other words, create your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">content calendar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Create a content calendar<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re scheduling your social posts in a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite, you can use these to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media calendar<\/a>. But your content calendar doesn\u2019t need to be on a social platform or a scheduling tool\u2014a Google Sheet works perfectly well. The main thing is organizing your content, cadence, and schedule.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here\u2019s what you need to include for each piece of content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dates and times:<\/strong> Specify when each post will go live, including the time of day you plan for each post to go live. Remember, time of day matters when it comes to engagement. Here\u2019s a guide to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-time-to-post-on-social-media\">best times to post on social media<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content type<\/strong>: Indicate whether it\u2019s an image, a video, a carousel, a status update, a poll, or something else. This will let you track how often you post different types of content and help you with performance analysis later.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Platforms<\/strong>: Record which social media platform the content will be posted on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Post details<\/strong>: Her,e you\u2019ll want to track the copy and the primary visuals for each post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Campaign<\/strong>: If your post is a part of a more extensive marketing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-campaign-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign<\/a>, make sure to note that in your calendar.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target audience<\/strong>: Include the specifics of the audience you\u2019re appealing to with social media content. For example, you might be posting for current customers or members of your community with a certain job title.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, your calendar should be a tool for you to make planning, tracking, and reviewing your social media content easier.<\/p>\n<h3>10.

Schedule progress reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Set up regular progress reviews to see how your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performance metrics<\/a> stack up against your goals. These could be monthly or quarterly, and they should also be annual. But it\u2019s important to make sure they\u2019re on your calendar so you\u2019re accountable for checking in.<\/p>\n<p>By checking in on your social media performance regularly, you\u2019ll be able to adjust your strategy to improve your performance. If something isn\u2019t working, you can pivot. If something is really working, double down.
