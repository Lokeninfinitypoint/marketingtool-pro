Penny. Counts! That\u2019s right, if you want to thrive in PPC advertising, you need to <strong>stretch that budget of yours as far as you can. <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-scheduling-cat-stretch-budget-1.png\" alt=\"ad scheduling stretch budget like this cat\" width=\"500\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Like so.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, as a PPC consultant, it\u2019s no surprise that my clients are always looking for tips, tricks, or tools to help them save money\u2014some of which become a gold mine for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Well, we have had one of those tools hiding right under our noses for a while, and it\u2019s called ad scheduling (formerly known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/30\/ad-scheduling\">dayparting<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">). It&#8217;s a simple concept, but implementing it can get hairy. There are fine details that you need to know to prevent any costly mistakes.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So in this post, I\u2019m going to uncover the money-saving magic, as well as the finer details\u2014of ad scheduling. We&#8217;ll talk about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">What ad scheduling is and how it saves you money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">How to set up ad scheduling in\u00a0Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The perks, drawbacks, and important details you need to know for best results.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">All of the above with plenty of pro tips sprinkled in. So let\u2019s get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What is ad scheduling?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By default, all ad campaigns across platforms are due to run 24\/7. Ad scheduling is the practice of limiting your campaigns to run only on certain days of the week and hours of the day. This way, you can ensure your ads are only showing during specific days\/times that you know you\u2019ll get the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">highest return on ad spend<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ad scheduling saves you money by only showing your ads on the days and times they best perform.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, I can look at my data to identify that Mondays between 9am-5pm is my best converting time. But on the opposite end, I spend on clicks on Sundays at 3am that are not converting. Therefore, I may want to adjust my ads to only run on weekdays from 9am-5pm, and not on weekends when I know this will be wasted spend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\"><em><strong>W<\/strong><\/em><em><strong>ant to save even more money? Found out how with our Free Google Ads Performance Grader!<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The perks of ad scheduling in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Ad scheduling<span lang=\"EN\"> in Google Ads is assigned at the campaign level for any campaign type. This even includes <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/30\/google-smart-shopping\">Smart campaigns<\/a>, which is a huge advantage. Why? Because while Smart campaigns do the heavy lifting for you, you\u2019re not able to control much since they run on their own via Google\u2019s algorithm. With ad scheduling, you can still regain at least some control over the campaign\u2019s behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google ad scheduling can apply to any campaign type, including Smart campaigns.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Additionally, being able to set this solely at the campaign level regardless of campaign type will help unify your ad groups and make things easier to manage at a high level. Ad schedules can get quite in depth, so the more you can make your scheduling strategy cohesive across your campaigns, the better. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Google Ads\u00a0scheduling drawbacks<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before you set up scheduling in Google Ads, there are three things about time zones you need to know:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Google ad schedules default to the time zone your account is set to. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Once you set up your Google account, the time zone you set cannot be changed later on. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You can only choose one time zone.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What this means is, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-ads\">running Google ads<\/a> in multiple time zones, you\u2019ll need to stretch your ad schedule to cover both zones. So if you want your ad to show on both the east and west coast from 1-4pm in both time zones, you\u2019ll need to do the math and set your ad schedule for 1pm-7pm. This isn\u2019t ideal if you don\u2019t want to run past 4pm on the east coast. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">In some cases with Google Ad scheduling, wasting spend is unavoidable. But if you do the math, you can mitigate this as much as possible.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One possible workaround would be to create separate campaigns and adjust those ad schedules zones accordingly, but this <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">account structure<\/a>\u00a0get hairy and you\u2019ll still need to do the math.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to set up ad scheduling in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Before you set up your ad schedule, use the tools available to you to identify the best one for your business and campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>1. View your historical data<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The key initial step to setting up a strong ad schedule is to analyze your historical data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First, select the campaign you\u2019d like to apply this to on the far left dark gray panel of the Google Ads screen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Under the \u201cSettings\u201d option (you may have to click \u201c+More), you\u2019ll then select the \u201cAd Schedule\u201d section<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-google-ads-setup-1.png\" alt=\"view historical data for google ads scheduling\" width=\"800\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You\u2019ll then see four different sections:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ad Schedule:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Where you click into to actually set up or adjust a new or current ad schedule assigned to your selected campaign.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Day &amp; Hour:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> A combination of data with both information on best\/least performing days and times together.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Day:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Average data on performance by day of week without hour.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Hour:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Average data on performance across the 24 hours in a day, regardless of what day of week it is. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When I want to help my clients set this game-changer up, I first point them to the last two in the above list\u2014the Day subsection and the Hour subsection, separately\u2014to evaluate their time-based performance thus far. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling-day-and-hour-1.png\" alt=\"google ads scheduling day and hour tab\" width=\"500\" height=\"799\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is because while the combined \u201cDay &amp; Hour\u201d subsection is helpful, it doesn\u2019t tend to provide the full picture, which is why we recommend looking at the other sections with the data broken out and draw your own conclusions from there. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Look at the \u201cDay\u201d and \u201cHour\u201d sections separately to get a full picture of your data.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>2. Consider additional scheduling factors<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Aside from using data to see what historically works, you also need to take into account other factors that might not be accounted for in the data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is where small business owners have a greater advantage when using this tool than I do as a consultant, because they have further insights into their business as to what days\/times are best for them. For example, if you know your business is only open on weekends or vice versa, you can adjust your ad schedule accordingly. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Select your schedule<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you identify what days and times you want to schedule your ad you can navigate over to the ad schedule subsection to set it up. Click the blue edit pencil and Google will provide a drop down with any and all available options for days and hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-google-ad-schedule-1.png\" alt=\"google ads scheduling ad schedule tab\" width=\"800\" height=\"379\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">With this you can even take it a step further and break it up. You could set ads to run in the morning, take a pause during lunch hour, then enable again in the afternoon. <strong>We encourage you to play around with different combinations <\/strong>to see what options you have and what you think would work best for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">The perks of ad scheduling in Microsoft Ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As with Google Ads, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/01\/microsoft-ads-optimizations\">Microsoft Ads<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> also allows you to apply an ad schedule to any campaign type at the campaign level. But overall,<strong> Microsoft gives us more flexibility with ad scheduling<\/strong>. How?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Not only does it allow us to set at the campaign level, but it can also be set at the ad group level. Additionally, you can even apply <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ads.microsoft.com\/#apex\/ads\/en\/56831\/1-500\">ad schedules<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> to individual<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/advertising\/guides\/ad-extensions?view=bingads-13\"> ad extensions<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Another major advantage of Microsoft Ads schedules over Google Ads schedules is that <strong>your ad schedule dynamically adjusts to the timezone of the viewer. <\/strong>That\u2019s right, while it may take more finesse to incorporate all timezones into your scheduling plan on Google Ads, over on Microsoft, the platform does the heavy lifting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">One note&#8230;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One thing to note here is that if you\u2019re leveraging <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/25\/bing-ads-scheduled-imports\">Microsoft Auto Import <\/a><span lang=\"EN\">to copy your Google Ads components over to Microsoft, then you\u2019ll quickly find that you\u2019ll want to <strong>manually manage your ad schedules between platforms<\/strong> since you\u2019ll most likely be setting them up differently.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to set up Microsoft ad scheduling<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">On top of giving us much more to play with when it comes to ad schedules, <strong>Microsoft also has two different spots where you can create and adjust ad schedules<\/strong>. The first being the campaign level settings, and the second being the actual ad schedule section on the left hand panel. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-microsoft-ads-setup-1.jpg\" alt=\"ad scheduling microsoft ads setup window\" width=\"800\" height=\"392\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once there, the setup is essentially similar to Google Ads where you can layer and select individual or groups of days\/times that you prefer to run. Just like we talked about with Google Ads, you may want to hop into the Ad Schedule section for Microsoft and evaluate the Day and Hour data sections.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-setup-microsoft-ads_0-1.png\" alt=\"how to set up ad scheduling microsoft setup tab\" width=\"800\" height=\"274\" \/><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to apply ad schedule bid adjustments on Google &amp; Microsoft<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Even if you want to run ads 24\/7, you can still leverage ad scheduling through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/09\/combined-bid-adjustments\">bid adjustments<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Both Google and Microsoft Ads allow for this. You can <strong>use this feature to\u00a0pay more or less per click during specific hours on certain days<\/strong>, depending how you\u2019d expect to perform. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, one workaround would be to set up an ad schedule that would still be inclusive of all hours and days. Then, add on schedule sets of what days or hours you\u2019d want to bid up or down on to manage those separately. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Or, even if you still wanted to leverage ad schedules to stop running 24\/7 you can still apply bid adjustments on a more restrictive ad schedule. However, with any<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2732132?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> bid adjustment<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, they will only be taken into account if the campaign is on a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/30\/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual\">manual <\/a><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/30\/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual\">bid strategy<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ad schedule bid adjustments can only be made if a campaign is on a manual bidding strategy.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, though the requirement is to have a manual bidding strategy to try out this loophole, it\u2019s truly not one size fits all and there are opportunities for bid adjustments for every account type!<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-bid-adjustments-1.png\" alt=\"bid adjustments in google ad scheduling\" width=\"800\" height=\"621\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see in the example above, <strong>you will have to isolate all the days separately<\/strong> to continue to run 24\/7, then break up the specific day you would like to apply a bid adjustment to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to set up ad scheduling in Facebook Ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Not to be confused with Facebook Ad Set <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/205560842812859\">start and end dates<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, ad scheduling<span lang=\"EN\"> on Facebook shares similar spend-restricting qualities with Google and Microsoft.
