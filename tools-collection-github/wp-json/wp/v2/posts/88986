In addition to impacting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel\">brand YouTube channels<\/a>, podcasts, and more, shifts in creator communities mean changes to partner and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing<\/a>, which brings us to the next video marketing trend for 2025.<\/p>\n<div id=\"video-creators-expand-monetization\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Video creators will expand monetization beyond brand partnerships<\/h3>\n<p>In 2024, creators continued the existing trend of placing more content behind a subscription and\/or paywall to generate direct revenue from fans. That\u2019s in addition to, or instead of, relying on brand sponsorships<\/p>\n<p>Last year, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/news.patreon.com\/articles\/celebrating-another-year-of-connecting-creators-and-their-real-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 million fans paid<\/a> for access to content from more than 300,000 creators on Patreon each month. Substack hit <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/substack-users#substack-paid-subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">49 million subscribers<\/a> on the platform in January 2024, and while the content is primarily copy and images, the platform has supported video since early <a href=\"https:\/\/on.substack.com\/p\/video-on-substack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022<\/a>. In 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/03\/28\/substack-community-fundraising-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axios<\/a> reported that there were more than 17,000 Substack newsletter writers, with the top 10 creators earning $25 million annually, a jump from $7 million in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram even offered accounts with more than 10,000 followers the option to host a one-to-many chat in a free, private <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/introducing-broadcast-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram broadcast channel<\/a> beginning in 2023, a tool that grew in 2024. By creating more exclusive content, influencers can cultivate a greater sense of community\u2014and, with paywalls, generate more revenue directly from their fans and followers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp\" alt=\"Video marketing trends - Instagram post from coffee content creatior.\" width=\"739\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88996 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp 739w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization-480x390.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Coffee content creator Lance Hedrick posts sponsored videos on Instagram and creates exclusive<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/lancehedrick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <em>Patreon content<\/em><\/a><em>, generating about $7,000 monthly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The platforms that support these exclusive communities and revenue generation, like Patreon and Substack, will continue to grow. So, in 2025, we\u2019ll see more exclusivity with video content, including vlogs, product reviews, and more.<\/p>\n<p>This shift behind a paywall has the potential to influence influencer marketing. This could mean more opportunities for better quality engagement in exclusive communities and creators who are less interested in smaller deals or working with new brands because they have diversified their revenue streams.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re still considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">which influencers you work with<\/a> this year, be sure to check out content that appears publicly versus in an exclusive community.
