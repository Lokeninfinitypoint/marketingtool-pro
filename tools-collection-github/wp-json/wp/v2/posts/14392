The majority of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing<\/a> campaigns look very organic, so people trust them as much as their friends. Thus, influencers help to build meaningful relationships with consumers: <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-2019-benchmark-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">82% of marketers<\/a> believe that influencer marketing campaigns bring buyers; <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/1794068\/INspired.%20Collective%20Bias%20eBook.%202017.pdf?submissionGuid=b6f37f39-b07f-4088-86b2-087748171297\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60% of consumers<\/a> have been influenced by a social media post or a blog review; the worldwide Instagram influencer market value is estimated to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/748630\/global-instagram-influencer-market-value\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.38 billion US dollars<\/a> in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Since customers trust opinion leaders more than branded content, it\u2019s important for ecommerce companies to work with them. For example, J.Crew collaborated with Melanie Elturk, popular fashion blogger and CEO of Haute Hijab. In partnership with the brand, Melanie created a post with a brand tag, featuring J.Crew\u2019s stuff. With over 235k engaged followers, the company was able to enter an already-established community of loyal fashion lovers who fit their target market.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da255eff-eac1-46ba-b720-0767a8178e2b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-social-media-influencers.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram social media influencer example\" width=\"794\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BtoU1oHHvud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, J.Crew has posted the same image on their business profile, showing fans and visitors that fashion bloggers choose the brand. As a result, it helps to build brand credibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Post user-generated content<\/h3>\n<p>Another buzzworthy trend in ecommerce is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">user-generated content<\/a> (UGC): <a href=\"https:\/\/crowdriff.com\/user-generated-content-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85%<\/a> of people find UGC to be more influential than branded content, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tintup.com\/blog\/38-mind-blowing-stats-effectiveness-user-generated-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">64%<\/a> of potential buyers actively seek out UGC before making a purchasing decision. When a company shares pictures created by users, it\u2019s a sign for potential clients that the product meets customers\u2019 needs. Even better, the post feels more sincere, as it\u2019s focused on a client, not a brand. Simply put, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onlinemarketinginstitute.org\/blog\/2018\/06\/6-reasons-encourage-ugc-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">encouraging followers<\/a> to create photos isn\u2019t an option for companies that want to provide social proof; it\u2019s a must-do.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, UGC is not just about featuring an item (which can be great for fashion brands); it\u2019s also about showing <em>how<\/em> your product works.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at <em>GoPro<\/em>, for example. The company motivates customers to share the videos and images they capture to show the best one-off on their Instagram account. For users, it\u2019s a perfect way to spread a word about themselves across 15 million followers. For the brand, it\u2019s an opportunity to provide other people with social proof.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b66bf87-96f8-4555-b84a-1bee831b933a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-user-generated-content.jpg\" alt=\"user-generated Instagram post example\" width=\"823\" height=\"430\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BuG6Rx3Hwqc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Share reviews and feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Customers have unlimited product purchase choices, and it can be difficult for them to make the right choice until they read <a href=\"https:\/\/gameranx.com\/features\/id\/13030\/article\/why-do-we-really-read-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumer guides<\/a>\u2014reviews. With the rise of social media, users have an opportunity to share their opinions and beliefs individually within a community without being interrupted. What is more, humans are social creatures, so they want to let others know about their experiences in order to help other customers make the right purchase decision. At the same time, the majority of buyers look for online reviews to learn from customers\u2019 experiences.\u00a0 All in all, online reviews are about social proof, so trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\">sell goods on Instagram<\/a>, it\u2019s important to share <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/08\/customer-feedback-ad-copy\">customer feedback<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works for <em>Frank Body<\/em>, a company that offers different coffee-based skin care products.

To cut through the noise, it\u2019s important to know what users\u2019 interests and intentions are.<\/p>\n<p>The solution? Trends! Knowing (or even predicting) trends helps to look before the masses have trained their eyes. When you keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.falcon.io\/insights-hub\/industry-updates\/social-media-updates\/instagram-marketing-trends-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram trends<\/a>, you can use them to your advantage, and top ecommerce brands know it for sure.<\/p>\n<h3>Use ephemeral content<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/instagram-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram content<\/a> is constantly evolving\u2014from overly-polished branded images to UGC photos, brands have to know what type of content works better for their target audience. Back in 2016, posting images to your newsfeed was a great idea. For now, companies need to create the FOMO (fear of missing out) effect with ephemeral content that lasts for 24 hours. Any proof needed? According to the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/instagram-stories-is-now-being-used-by-500-million-people-daily\/547270\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">update<\/a>, over <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500 million accounts<\/a> use Instagram Stories daily.<\/p>\n<p>This means a growing demand for short-lived content. With ephemeral content, not only will you stay up-to-date, but you will also beat the Instagram algorithm, delivering your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/08\/brand-story\">brand message<\/a> to the target audience. Plus, there are different business-specific features that allow brands to grow online.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <em>LUSH<\/em> avoids clogging up the main feed with content and the company posts Instagram Stories to provide followers with more information about their products. What is more, the brand explains how to use their stuff\u2014worried customers can understand everything they need to know about products, and therefore purchase faster.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"86f3718c-fa0a-4c2c-8415-c337a7581188\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brand-ephemeral-content.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram ephemeral content example\" width=\"809\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17845838236357763\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For a variety of reasons, ephemeral content is on its rise, and ecommerce brands can make the most out of this trend by using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">Instagram Stories<\/a> in different ways: show off their products, teach customers how to use their stuff, announce the product launch, offer time-limited discounts, and much more.<\/p>\n<h3>Run vertical video advertising campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>With the growth of social shopping, brands need to understand how consumer behavior has changed. For example, modern customers would like to watch vertical videos instead of horizontal ones, as they hold their phone upright <a href=\"http:\/\/data.wurfl.io\/MOVR\/pdf\/2014_q4\/MOVR_2014_q4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">94% of the time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Take care of your customers, and they will choose your brand. Here\u2019s one example: In 2017, Michael Kors brand wanted to inform its millennial audience about its new Michael Kors Access smartwatches, so the company targeted young women with custom Instagram Stories that varied in length, resulting in a 24x lift in ad recall and 8.8x increase in favorability.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"423784cd-f836-48cd-8f3d-7eb14d9e47f1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-vertical-videos.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce vertical video example\" width=\"433\" height=\"816\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/success\/michael-kors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Michael Kors marketers were able to predict <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martechadvisor.com\/articles\/social-media-marketing-2\/the-rise-of-vertical-video-content-on-social-media\/\">the rise of vertical video content<\/a>, so they engaged their target audience <em>and <\/em>outperformed competitors. For other brands, it\u2019s a good example of how to run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/24\/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns\">Instagram marketing campaigns<\/a> and bring better business results.<\/p>\n<h3>Communicate via direct messages<\/h3>\n<p>In 2018, Instagram rolled out various features to improve communication via direct messages. Now, it\u2019s possible to send GIFs, voice messages, share Stories or posts, and even do a video chat\u2014this means huge marketing potential for companies that want to sell on the platform. Once you get a question about your company or product, it\u2019s easy to start a conversation via direct messages and make your potential customer feel special.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, there\u2019s already a standalone <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/uy\/app\/direct-from-instagram\/id1315182410?ref=producthunt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Messenger app<\/a> for iOS. It\u2019s no wonder ecommerce brands such as <em>Kendall and Kylie<\/em> invite people to slide into direct messages\u2014it has become a great way to establish long-term connections with customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2ac8df36-b559-4bb6-82dd-e4deedab1491\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-instagram-direct-messages.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram ecommerce brands direct messaging example\" width=\"776\" height=\"507\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re a big brand, it\u2019s more likely you will get many direct messages daily, so it\u2019s important to ensure these messages don\u2019t get buried in the inbox. It\u2019s important to reply to the inquiry once you get it, and the best way is to do it without spending much time. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/instagram-quick-replies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram quick replies<\/a> feature, you can make the most out of Instagram Direct interface for businesses accounts and answer frequently-asked questions, provide customer support, or thank followers for joining your community.<\/p>\n<p>It goes without saying that modern users crave <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized experiences<\/a>, so communicating via direct messages helps to improve the customer journey, and therefore increase customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway: <\/strong>Instagram is rolling out more and more features, so users content preferences change. Keeping up with trends is a proven way to give your followers what they want, so that you can bring your business to the next level.<\/p>\n<h2>Ecommerce brand lesson #3: Better customer experiences lead to more sales<\/h2>\n<p>Whatever marketplace you choose, it\u2019s important to ensure your customers get positive experiences at every single step of the customer journey\u2014from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">brand awareness<\/a> to customer loyalty. When selling on Instagram, it\u2019s even more important to improve the buying process: The platform has been a photo-sharing place for many years, so not all customers are used to buying on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Better customer experience means customer satisfaction, which means more sales and more revenue. All in all, your profile must be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webcreate.me\/optimize-instagram-ecommerce-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimized for ecommerce<\/a> if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/05\/instagram-ecommerce\">sell on Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Show off your product<\/h3>\n<p>When shopping online, customers can save time and money. However, the main problem for online buyers is that they can\u2019t see or try the product physically before purchasing. It\u2019s hard to say whether it can fit or not. While it can be a real pain for customers, top ecommerce brands know how to deal with this problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Showing off products matters. <\/strong>The more details you provide, the better understanding of your product customers have. Right now, brands can take photos of their product from different angles and upload a post with multiple photos or videos. Here\u2019s <em>Adidas Originals<\/em> shows this strategy in action:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e4073218-6ebb-4e0a-beaf-4ad4eba2883b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-product-images.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce brands product images on Instagram\" width=\"798\" height=\"597\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/adidasoriginals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the company has posted several photos to introduce YEEZY BOOST 700 SALT, showing off the sneakers from all the sides and including a multi-image post to provide specific details. This helps interested followers learn more about the item even before they buy these shoes.<\/p>\n<h3>Make the navigation easier<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re starting from zero on Instagram, it\u2019s easy for visitors to look through every single post. You simply don\u2019t need the navigation, and it makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>But for large (or more experienced) brands, the navigation is highly important. Why? Because your followers need to look through too many posts to find what they\u2019re looking for. To increase impulse buying, ecommerce brands need to simplify the buying process. The easier it\u2019s to find a product, the more people will buy.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Stories Highlights, Lululemon can deliver a positive shopping experience to its customers\u2014everything is grouped into Highlights and a person can jump into a circle that can provide valuable information. For example, I don\u2019t need to scroll over 2600 posts to find what\u2019s new: I just tap on \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d highlights and watch the stories. Awesome!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ef2341b7-abf3-4ff3-88dc-dff9bb5e8bbb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-instagram-highlights.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram highlights example\" width=\"770\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lululemon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Note that there are dozens of ways to organize your Highlights, and everything depends on your creativity: You can post new arrivals and items on sale or highlight collections and other featured items. Just think about your potential customers\u2019 needs, try to predict their queries, and create Stories Highlights that satisfy the needs!<\/p>\n<h3>Optimize in-app purchases<\/h3>\n<p>More and more ecommerce features appear on Instagram, making it easier for users to give social shopping a try\u2014not only can they <strong>discover<\/strong> products in-app, but they can also <strong>buy<\/strong> items on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>For companies, this means huge sales potential: It\u2019s a cost-effective and fast way to turn followers into buyers.

So, to turn Instagram into a powerful sales machine, the following things can help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add action buttons to your bio (Shop Now)<\/li>\n<li>Insert shop link in bio<\/li>\n<li>Use shoppable tags<\/li>\n<li>Include Instagram Stories product stickers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want your followers to buy on Instagram, think about their needs and try to make this process easier and simpler. Use Instagram\u2019s ecommerce features to help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway: <\/strong>While companies can offer almost the same products,\u00a0 customer experience is what makes them different from each other. If you can provide a positive customer experience, it\u2019s more likely people will choose your brand over hundreds of competitors on the market.<\/p>\n<h2>Ecommerce brand lesson #4: Listen to your customers\u2014on Instagram<\/h2>\n<p>No matter what business you have, it\u2019s crucial to know everything about your potential customers. The more you understand your target audience, the better for your company. And Instagram is a perfect place for collecting customer feedback: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bufferapp.com\/why-talking-about-ourselves-is-as-rewarding-as-sex-the-science-of-conversations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of social media posts<\/a> are dedicated to ourselves, our opinions and beliefs. For companies, it\u2019s a perfect source of candid consumer opinion, so it\u2019s no wonder ecommerce brands pay attention to their customers\u2019 feedback and make the most out of it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are three ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/08\/customer-feedback-ad-copy\">collect customer feedback<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Social media monitoring and listening<\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/news-trends\/social-media-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customers crave communication with brands<\/a>, and when they say something about your company online, they expect the brand to react. Thus, companies should not only track what their customers say online with social media monitoring but also understand what customers say about your industry as a whole with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/25\/social-listening-boolean-search\">social listening<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, social media monitoring is about tracking and responding to all digital messages sent to the company or said about any of the products and services online, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/20\/social-listening\">social listening<\/a> is about understanding the bigger picture.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <em>ASOS<\/em> has a great number of customers who share their thoughts online, and it serves as a hint for the marketers. Once people started discussing the need for a discount, ASOS couldn\u2019t ignore the demand for it and the company created a promo code for its fans:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"91b220d6-4f35-433a-9524-afb9da547a1b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-social-media-monitoring.jpg\" alt=\"social media monitoring Instagram post\" width=\"744\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BmseottgNxI\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The example above proves that customers can either tag your brand or not. If they do it, you get a notification so it\u2019s easy to take an action. But if they don\u2019t do it, it takes time and effort to find what people are saying about your company. Obviously, you can check brand mentions written online, you can use different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/08\/social-media-marketing-tools\">social media monitoring tools<\/a> to optimize the process.<\/p>\n<h3>Read comments<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.socedo.com\/4-reasons-read-followers-comments-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reasons to read followers comments<\/a> is an opportunity to find (and solve) your customers\u2019 problems. It\u2019s the way to not only take care of your customers but also improve your product or service. Moreover, taking care of the customers helps to earn trust and loyalty, and, therefore, attract more clients.<\/p>\n<p>When <em>Nike<\/em> introduced the new Nike Epic React sneakers, the company claimed that the shoes were more durable, so people wanted to give this model a try. However, it occurred that shoes could be shrunk, according to one comment on Instagram. Even though it was difficult to prove that the quality of shoes was low, it was important to solve the problem before it spread:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"252d74b0-3aa4-4106-9aaf-0c3ba2f80b4b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-instagram-comments.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce brands Instagram comments example\" width=\"797\" height=\"592\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BtlbYVkgzWS\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If the company hadn\u2019t reacted to the comment, the information would have spread among potential clients who monitor social media before making the purchase decision. In other words, it could have a negative effect on sales.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Instagram Stories polls<\/h3>\n<p>If you believe that social media isn\u2019t the best place for <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxl.com\/blog\/social-media-market-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doing market research<\/a>, we have bad news for you then. Since people are happy to share their thoughts online, it\u2019s no wonder platforms roll out features to understand them better.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Instagram has poll and question stickers that allow users to either choose from two options or tell more with open-ended questions. All in all, polls help you understand followers better and provide them with more valuable information so that you can <a href=\"https:\/\/surveyanyplace.com\/increase-customer-satisfaction-with-instagram-polls\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase customer satisfaction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Instagram Stories has a short lifespan of 24 hours, so it\u2019s a proven way to get the results fast. With the help of Instagram Stories polls and questions, <em>Sephora<\/em> asks what the customers want to read from the brand, and it doesn\u2019t take much time to produce this content to hook followers and satisfy their needs:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"38ca230d-b217-4824-b2c8-1ca69c27d56a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-brands-instagram-story-polls.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Story polls example\" width=\"779\" height=\"703\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/sephora\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway: <\/strong>Instagram is a valuable source of information that comes directly from your customers who know what they want from your company and what keeps them away from buying your products.
