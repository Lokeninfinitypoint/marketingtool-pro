Facebook advertising does this by allowing you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">target specific audiences<\/a> that are likely to be interested in your products and services by leveraging the immense wealth of data Facebook has about its users.<\/p>\n<p>First, you identify your campaign objective, or what you want your Facebook ads to actually accomplish. This might be driving traffic to your website, encouraging visitors to download your app, generating leads, or increasing sales.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified your campaign objective, you then tell Facebook to whom your ads should be displayed. This is done by what is known as <em>audience segmentation<\/em> \u2013 the process of providing Facebook with a profile of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">ideal audience<\/a> so Facebook only displays your ads to people who exhibit the behaviors and belong to the demographics you\u2019re interested in. Facebook has thousands of custom audience parameters, allowing you to create amazingly refined audience segments for your campaigns. You can also create custom audiences by uploading data on existing customers that you already have, which enables Facebook to create \u201clookalike\u201d audiences based on parameters that you choose.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"114b8ad3-7757-4659-b231-b96d8c1afb10\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook1.jpg\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook\" width=\"530\" height=\"290\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Next, you create the ads you want to run. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/08\/facebook-ads-tips\">Facebook ads<\/a> are highly visual and align with the ways in which people use Facebook, particularly on mobile devices \u2013 definitely no tiny, text-based ads here.

However, there are a couple of elements that are unique to Facebook advertising, the first of which is a concept known as <em>competitive value<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The competitive value of a Facebook ad is the sum of an advertiser\u2019s maximum bid \u2013 how much an advertiser is willing to pay every time a user takes the desired action \u2013 and the ad\u2019s <em>intrinsic quality bid<\/em>, or how much engagement an ad brings to Facebook and the user experience. Although the precise methodology behind how Facebook calculates intrinsic quality bid is a closely guarded secret, Facebook does concede that factors such as the volume of clicks, likes, and shares is included in this calculation, as is general feedback on an ad.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d9777dcc-fcde-4af5-937a-b2a23eda5873\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-maximum-bid.jpg\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work maximum bid\" width=\"442\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Other factors, such as user age and other demographic data, can<br \/>\nalso impact bid costs. Image via AdWeek.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, not every advertiser wants users to take the same action or shares the same campaign objective. This is why Facebook advertising calculates the maximum bid of an advertiser by determining the estimated cost-per-thousand impressions of an ad, or eCPM. This system allows <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-competitive-advertising\">Facebook advertisers to compete<\/a> on equal footing, regardless of objective or ad format. For more on how Facebook applies this calculation to various ads and objectives, read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/430291176997542\">this section of the Facebook for Business support documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>A Brief History of Facebook Advertising<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we know how Facebook advertising works, it\u2019s worthwhile looking back at the social network\u2019s history \u2013 and its subsequently meteoric rise to global dominance \u2013 to understand why Facebook advertising is so effective.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook Flyers<\/h3>\n<p>Many marketers mistakenly believe that Facebook first got into the advertising game back in 2012, shortly before it filed its surprisingly poor IPO (strange how quickly this was forgotten in subsequent years). However, although Facebook did indeed introduce a raft of advertising options four years ago, the history of Facebook advertising traces back to the social network\u2019s very earliest days in 2004 with what were known as Facebook Flyers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"58416ce0-7756-47a7-88d6-0e1235e82d2e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-facebook-flyer-example.png\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work Facebook Flyer example\" width=\"135\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>These cheap, simple ads were designed to be the digital equivalent of notices you probably saw on noticeboards in your college dorm or plastered around the quad. Aimed at individuals and small businesses hoping to target students at specific campuses during the early days of Facebook\u2019s burgeoning growth throughout academia, Facebook Flyers cost between $10 and $40 per day and were primarily used to advertise social gatherings (read: keggers) and other things you\u2019d expect to see in campus noticeboard ads \u2013 dog-walking services, part-time barista jobs, you get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Although it would be easy to dismiss Flyers as a way for Mark Zuckerberg to make a quick buck and cover the rising costs of the site\u2019s hosting (which was still known as thefacebook.com when Flyers were introduced), Flyers actually bore many of the hallmarks of \u201ctrue\u201d paid social ads, even way back then.\u00a0Advertisers could choose from a range of themes, precursors to the wide range of ad formats available today.\u00a0Advertisers were encouraged to include images to increase CTR, a common practice in today&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/25\/online-advertising-landscape\">online advertising campaigns<\/a>. Facebook\u00a0Flyers featured character limits (25 characters for headlines, 200 characters for ad text). Advertisers were encouraged to include links to a landing page, a paid social best practice that remains relevant and highly recommended, and\u00a0advertisers could also set budgets and determine ad visibility just as they can today. Finally,\u00a0Flyers could be targeted to Facebook users based on a range of demographics in much the same way (albeit somewhat more simplistically) they can today.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back at Facebook Flyers, it becomes a lot easier to see Zuckerberg\u2019s long-term strategy for monetizing his rapidly growing site. In 2012, there was a great deal of speculation that Facebook would monetize solely to appease investors and shareholders when the company went public, but it\u2019s obvious that this strategy was on the table from the outset.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook\u2019s Declining Organic Reach<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we know a little more about Flyers, it\u2019s important to examine how Facebook gradually strangled the organic reach of posts to essentially force companies to \u201cpay to play.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although marketers capitalizing on Facebook\u2019s organic reach suspected that things were going from bad to worse for some time, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/social.ogilvy.com\/facebook-zero-considering-life-after-the-demise-of-organic-reach\/\">the landmark Social@Ogilvy study<\/a> that was published by Ogilvy &amp; Mather in 2014 that revealed just how shocking the decline of Facebook\u2019s organic reach had become.<\/p>\n<p>Between October 2013 and February 2014, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook pages<\/a> of all types saw dramatic reductions in organic reach \u2013 a trend that came to be known by many names, from \u201cFacebook Zero\u201d to \u201cReachpocalypse\u201d:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"98804285-2220-4991-82e0-20fc53c3569d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-advertise-on-facebook-organic-reach-decline-1.png\" alt=\"how to get real facebook likes\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Aside from how rapidly Facebook\u2019s organic reach declined, the real surprise (or not) came from Facebook\u2019s official position on the matter. When asked if the decision to gradually throttle the organic reach of organic content on Facebook was a financially motivated business decision, Facebook said no. In an official blog post, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/Organic-Reach-on-Facebook\">Facebook\u2019s VP of Advertising Technology Brian Boland claimed that the decline in organic reach was caused by several factors<\/a>, including an increase in the volume of content being published on Facebook to the refinement of the News Feed algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>While these factors may indeed have contributed to \u201cFacebook Zero,\u201d some of the digital marketing industry\u2019s most prominent thought leaders weren\u2019t convinced. Jay Baer of Convince &amp; Convert <a href=\"http:\/\/www.convinceandconvert.com\/social-media-tools\/this-chart-explains-the-reachpocalypse-and-why-facebook-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank\/\">plotted the data from the Ogilvy study against changes in Facebook\u2019s stock value<\/a>, and the results certainly suggest that the decline in organic reach had a hugely positive financial impact for Facebook, whether intentional or otherwise:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10aa023f-5ac0-430b-9541-f04cadc0a029\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-organic-reach-decline-stock-price.png\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work Facebook stock price vs. organic reach decline\" width=\"633\" height=\"332\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Convince &amp; Convert<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the steady decline in organic reach on Facebook correlates almost perfectly with the steady increase in Facebook\u2019s stock price. Of course, correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but this data speaks volumes about how Facebook gained from many marketers\u2019 loss, regardless of whether this was a calculated business decision or a happy coincidence.<\/p>\n<h2>What Makes Facebook Ads So Effective?<\/h2>\n<p>So, now that we know a little more about Facebook ads\u2019 history, let\u2019s take a look at why <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/29\/adwords-ad-rotation-changes\">Facebook ads<\/a> work and are such a powerfully alluring option for digital marketers.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook\u2019s Immense Global Audience<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook has a global audience of approximately 1.5 BILLION people \u2013 around one-fifth of the entire planet\u2019s population, give or take a few hundred million. Understandably, this statistic is one of the most popular among Facebook advertising evangelists, and for good reason. No other social network comes close to Facebook\u2019s market penetration, but what\u2019s almost as exciting as the sheer enormity of Facebook\u2019s audience is the time in which it achieved this unprecedented achievement.<\/p>\n<p>The figure below, taken from Pew Research Center, shows Facebook\u2019s growth trajectory from its inception in 2004 to 2013. Note that this data focuses on monthly active users, or MAUs, not Facebook\u2019s total registered user base, which would likely be significantly larger if inactive accounts were included:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"786966c9-b26b-4b31-90bc-8ecc62ae0137\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-how-many-users.png\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook how many users worldwide\" width=\"310\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>There are two main reasons this growth in users is so important to advertisers. The first is that the larger the audience, the more granularly advertisers can target potential prospects. Unlike traditional advertising platforms, the emphasis in paid social is on finding the <em>right<\/em> people, not finding as many people as possible, a paradigm that is the polar opposite of platforms such as TV and radio advertising.<\/p>\n<p>As Facebook\u2019s user base continues to grow, the larger the potential audiences advertisers can target based on demographics, personal interests, purchasing behavior, life events, and thousands of other criteria that can improve the ROI of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/03\/facebook-f8\">Facebook advertising campaign<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason Facebook\u2019s growth trajectory is so important is that, whether you use Facebook personally or not, the platform continues to align strongly with changing media consumption habits and the adoption of consumer technology such as mobile devices. According to data from <a href=\"http:\/\/investor.fb.com\/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=940609\">Facebook\u2019s Q3 2015 earnings report<\/a>, the number of daily active users accessing the site via mobile devices was 893 million during September of last year, a year-over-year increase of 27%.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, 727 million people \u2013 almost half of Facebook\u2019s MAUs \u2013 <strong>never<\/strong> access the site from a desktop, meaning that Facebook has one of (if not the) largest mobile-exclusive monthly user bases of any site in the world.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"22e2f426-dba7-4f6d-bc92-c9276dbc6575\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-advertise-on-facebook-mobile-only-users.png\" alt=\"Why advertise on Facebook mobile only users\" width=\"515\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Data\/image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/11\/04\/47-of-facebooks-users-never-touch-the-service-on-desktop\/\"><em>VentureBeat<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that this data does NOT include usage statistics from either WhatsApp or Instagram, meaning Facebook\u2019s total worldwide mobile usage penetration is considerably larger than the data above indicates.<\/p>\n<h3>Is Facebook Dying?<\/h3>\n<p>With all the talk about growth and increasing mobile adoption, it would be remiss of me to not briefly mention the inevitable (and often unintentionally hilarious) doomsayers and their prophetic predictions of Facebook\u2019s imminent demise.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f75a7bfd-732f-4d9a-a106-a3a83f157a6e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-is-facebook-dying.jpg\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook is Facebook dying\" width=\"367\" height=\"216\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In January 2014, two researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (yes, you read that correctly) conducted a study to determine the potential longevity of Facebook as a social network, and how fluctuations in adoption and usage of social networks can reflect trends often observed in epidemiology, the study of how diseases spread (again, you read that correctly). The paper concluded that, based on declining volumes of the keyword \u201cFacebook\u201d according to Google Trends data, <a href=\"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1401.4208v1.pdf\">that Facebook was doomed and would begin to crumble like the Roman Empire as early as next year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019ll be the first to concede that my command of algebra leaves a great deal to be desired, so I\u2019ll trust the researchers\u2019 math. What I can\u2019t get behind, however, is their methodology. Basing such a bold claim \u2013 the imminent demise of the world\u2019s largest, most popular social network by 2017 in spite of established, continued, demonstrable growth \u2013 on Google Trends data alone seems flawed at best, and negligent at worst.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, the paper\u2019s publication sparked a predictable tsunami of similarly illogical think-pieces about how Facebook is dying, how the company is in trouble, and all other manner of grim tidings. Of course, apocalyptic predictions are to be expected whenever a company is doing well (or not), especially when there\u2019s all those marketers and bloggers out there desperately clamoring for pageviews. However, this doesn\u2019t mean Facebook is dying, nor should it factor into your marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4decd897-57dc-4b35-b31e-1d09a206014b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-facebook-user-growth.png\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work Facebook user growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s true that, overall, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/2015\/01\/09\/social-media-update-2014\/\">user adoption of Facebook has slowed in some parts of the world<\/a>, such as the United States and parts of Asia. However, with so many people already using the service, market saturation was bound to have an impact on Facebook\u2019s growth trajectory eventually. This is not the death knell you may have heard about, however. Facebook remains the most popular social network in the world, and slower growth is still growth. Other social networks have grown, but they\u2019re still nowhere close to even approaching Facebook\u2019s market penetration.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is also still crushing it in terms of user engagement. According to data from Pew Research Center, 70% of U.S. Facebook users access the site daily, of which 43% do so multiple times per day. In addition, 82% of the highly coveted 18-29 year-old demographic are among the most actively engaged Facebook users.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b7d7202f-63c6-4faa-adf1-901dc74bcfd2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-how-popular-is-facebook.png\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook how popular is Facebook\" width=\"776\" height=\"559\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/facebook-user-engagement-remains-high-2015-9\"><em>Business Insider<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>TL;DR \u2013 don\u2019t believe the hype.

Some Data on Facebook Costs<\/h2>\n<p>Although advertisers have many elements to consider when launching a new online advertising campaign, from potential reach to ad creative, oftentimes it comes down to cold, hard numbers. Fortunately, <strong>Facebook is one of the most cost-effective advertising platforms available<\/strong>. However, with so many ad formats available, the question of ROI depends greatly on the ad format in question. Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<p>The figure below, based on WordStream data, shows that the average cost-per-click of Facebook ads is $1.72 &#8211; a remarkably low CPC considering how effective Facebook ads can be:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"76a9ceeb-f97c-46ae-89fb-33ae366b3ab4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-cost-per-click-cpc-7.png\" alt=\"facebook posted massive increases in cost per click despite losses in impressions\" width=\"800\" height=\"692\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Facebook ads are similarly cost-effective when it comes to cost-per-action, or CPA. As we can see in the figure below, CPAs across Facebook ads vary quite widely. Some sectors offer more competitive CPAs than others. The education and apparel verticals have significantly lower CPAs than the home improvement and technology verticals:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1ee23ab4-c313-474e-9d78-69adb4c38b39\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-cost-per-action-graphic-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook ads cost per action\" width=\"800\" height=\"752\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To see even more data on Facebook advertising costs, check out the full range of WordStream data on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">Facebook advertising benchmarks for your industry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although the cost of Facebook advertising has risen in recent years, overall costs remain significantly lower in many cases than similar metrics in PPC.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2ed72982-e09b-4648-9dbb-8e316566a76b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-facebook-ads-average-cpc.png\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work Facebook ads average CPC\" width=\"1287\" height=\"423\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2015\/07\/salesforce-ads-benchmark-key-trends-across-facebook-twitter.html\"><em>Salesforce Q1 2015 Advertising Benchmark report<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The figure above highlights the average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM), cost-per-click (CPC), and click-through rate (CTR) for Facebook ads worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that in the United States, for example, the average CPM decreased considerably between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015. You\u2019ll also see that in many regions (primarily English-speaking countries), CTR actually increased alongside this decrease in CPM, indicating stronger engagement with Facebook ads in these areas. Overall, the average CPM of Facebook ads decreased by 11% worldwide during the Q4 2014-Q1 2015 period, adjusting for normal seasonality fluctuations.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Advertise on Facebook: A WordStream Case Study<\/h3>\n<p>Although statistics like those above are very interesting, and make a powerful case for incorporating Facebook into your wider digital strategy, one of the drawbacks of this data is that it\u2019s pretty far removed from the actual ads and campaigns that generate these figures.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, I asked <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mchale05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brett McHale<\/a>, WordStream\u2019s resident paid social expert, to show us an example of how effective Facebook advertising has been for WordStream \u2013 and the importance of focusing on campaign objectives, even when it seems counterintuitive.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"48a34db7-76b3-426b-99b8-86eab69c6226\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook ad example\" width=\"609\" height=\"611\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Ad creative for the Digital Marketer\u2019s Road Map campaign<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Brett recently put together a campaign for a bundle of whitepapers, blog posts, and other content resources called <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLPaidFacebookTheDigitalMarketersRoadMap.html?cid=Paid_Facebook_Audiences_Marketing_DigitalMarketersRoadMap_Download&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Paid&amp;utm_campaign=Audiences&amp;utm_content=DigitalMarketersRoadMap&amp;utm_term=Marketing\">The Digital Marketer\u2019s Road Map<\/a>. In the past, Brett had managed to achieve strong performance according to traditional metrics. However, in this campaign, Brett noticed that focusing on CTR and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/14\/facebook-relevance-score\">Relevance Score<\/a> wasn\u2019t translating into conversions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to Facebook adverting, it\u2019s important to take the metrics that they give you and reapply them to your end goal,\u201d says Brett. \u201cTake Relevance Score and CTR, for example. These two metrics are held in high regard because they are both interrelated, but if your goal is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/05\/effective-facebook-ads-for-lead-generation\">lead generation<\/a>, they become substantially less important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the past, Brett devoted a great deal of time, effort, and energy into maintaining high Relevance Scores by rotating his ad creative on a regular basis \u2013 sometimes daily \u2013 to ensure the ads being displayed in his campaigns were fresh. By paying such close attention to his campaigns, Brett was able to achieve Relevance Scores of between 7 and 9, significantly higher than the Facebook average, as well as click-through rates of between 4-5%, also much higher than the average campaign.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ed644472-54bb-4600-b600-fdf62a7fde07\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-relevance-score.jpg\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook Relevance Score\" width=\"619\" height=\"348\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The only problem was that this approach wasn\u2019t yielding many conversions, despite the campaigns\u2019 strengths according to traditional metrics \u2013 so Brett went back to basics.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI decided to redirect my focus back to the central value proposition and let the ads run to the desired audiences,\u201d Brett says. \u201cMy Relevance Score dropped back to around 4 or 5, my CTR dropped as low as 0.68%, and my Frequency would increase to 2.00 to 3.50.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ordinarily, many advertisers would be gravely concerned by this perceived drop in performance. The difference in terms of results for Brett\u2019s campaigns, however, was amazing, as evidenced by the two graphs below.<\/p>\n<p>The first graph shows performance over time for the ad sets with high CTR and high Relevance Scores:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cab865f6-3439-4ae7-9247-79ec0db99dcd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-i-advertise-on-facebook-high-ctr.jpg\" alt=\"Should I advertise on Facebook high CTR\" width=\"1036\" height=\"264\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The second graph shows performance over time for the ad sets with lower CTRs and lower Relevance Scores \u2013 but <strong>the second set resulted in 75% more conversions than the first<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ef7be2cd-ce8e-48c6-b94c-106e84147e7b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-facebook-advertising-work-get-more-conversions-on-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"Does Facebook advertising work get more conversions on Facebook\" width=\"589\" height=\"321\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Brett\u2019s key takeaway from this campaign? Focus on what\u2019s important to <em>you<\/em>, not traditional metrics that may not even apply to your campaign objectives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cApply the metrics they give you to <em>your<\/em> goals, not superficial expectations based on generalized perceptions of success that some \u2018guru\u2019 tells you,\u201d says Brett. \u201cIf your strategy is to drive clicks and lower costs in relation to the volume of people you are reaching, take the Relevance Score route. If you want leads and conversions that could turn into potential customers, focus on CPA. Stick to the fundamentals.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line: Yes, Facebook Ads Work!<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been trying to figure out whether Facebook ads even work or whether <a href=\"\/facebook-advertising\">Facebook advertising is right for you<\/a>, this guide should put your concerns to rest.
