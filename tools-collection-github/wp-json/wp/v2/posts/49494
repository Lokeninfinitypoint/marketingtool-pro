Not in the slightest. CMI makes its thank you clear with a black, bolded headline and then provides the link to download the course with \u201cas promised\u201d right after it. It also reinforces what, exactly, the user just downloaded with multiple mentions of the course name.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Next steps: 1<\/strong><br \/>\nPeople love to follow trends, so the suggestions of other popular content is a nice touch. However, there are three options to download, plus an event registration CTA, and each offer is the same color and size as the CTA to download the intended course. And then there are the options in the navigation bar. So while the copy is cohesive and it flows nicely, there is too much of it for a thank you page and users could struggle to pick where to go next.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity: 3<\/strong><br \/>\nCMI\u2019s clean graphics here take the cake. The simple imagery to go along with the selected course gives a customized feel and the page stays on-brand.

With less text and fewer options on the page, it\u2019s easier for viewers to quickly make a decision. Plus, suggesting related resources that don\u2019t require a download may convert better since these people have already completed a download once.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity: 5<\/strong><br \/>\nWrike seriously deserves full points here because it was able to make a visually appealing thank you page using abstract graphics\u2014which is refreshing. It also keeps its viewers engaged in a unique way by suggesting content to take them back to the site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5<\/strong><br \/>\nUnlike other forms of content creation, thank pages are one of the few areas where exclamation points are okay. The big, friendly exclamation point at the end of Wrike\u2019s thank you adds emphasis to its level of appreciation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6.

And why so many steps to confirm, Backlinko? I know it\u2019s the usual \u201cgo to your email to confirm,\u201d but spelling out the steps like this makes it seem like a chore.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity: 3<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO<\/a> can be daunting to some, so Backlinko\u2019s mention of \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/24\/link-building-now\">link building strategies<\/a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO tips<\/a>\u201d drives home the value of the newsletter and encourages the user to confirm their subscription. But while the content is strong and conversational, the page is visually lackluster and unappealing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 0<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is a multi-step process, and Backlinko hasn\u2019t yet thanked its user for subscribing.

RoboForm<\/h3>\n<p>This RoboForm thank you page example is for signing up to use its free product.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/roboform-thank-you-page-example.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"445\" alt=\"thank you page example by roboform\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crazyegg.com\/blog\/hack-your-thank-you-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 10<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clarity: 1<\/strong><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">The copy is brief, but the heading only indirectly confirms that the user has signed up. Plus, what did they sign up for? Why should they be glad they did?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Next steps: 1<\/strong><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">The action Roboform wants you to take is super clear: to join their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\">referral program<\/a>. However, since there isn\u2019t consistency in capitalization between the two headings, it\u2019s not clear that you\u2019ll be getting one of their paid products, Roboform Everywhere, for free. Rather it sounds like by referring customers, you\u2019ll be doing them a favor and getting Roboform everywhere.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity: 5<\/strong><br \/>\nRoboform\u2019s creative elements stay consistent with its brand and compliment its adorable robot mascot nicely. And instead of a standard \u201cthank you\u201d it offers a compliment to butter up its customers\u2014which helps them stand out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 3 <\/strong><br \/>\nThis is not a standard thank you, but Roboform still gets points for still making users feel appreciated in a different way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>11. Educators for Excellence<\/h3>\n<p>Educators for Excellence wraps up our thank you page example roundup with a page made for event registrants.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/thank-you-page-examples-educators-for-excellence.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"457\" alt=\"thank you page examples: educators for excellence\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 15<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Organization: 5<\/strong><br \/>\nThe confirmation here is loud and clear. This is one of the few thank you page examples with contact information. For events, including a link for contacts is super helpful.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Next steps: 2<\/strong><br \/>\nAside from contacting for questions, it\u2019s unclear what Educators for Excellence is looking for you to do next. The three prominent CTA buttons are layered on top of all the other options within the main navigation bar and footer.<strong> <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity: 4<\/strong><br \/>\nIn terms of creative, this thank you page is clean with simple green accents\u2014which is on brand for Educators for Excellence. However, with all that text this thank you page could benefit from a visual. Perhaps a compelling picture showing what to expect at the event.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 4<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile this brand also says thank you twice like a couple of our other thank you page examples, the lack of punctuation makes me feel like something is still missing here.<strong> <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Use these thank you page examples to perfect yours<\/h2>\n<p>Use these thank you page examples as your go-to for your next thank you page brainstorm. And even though I covered a lot above, I want to leave you with some final reminders.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly confirm the action you\u2019re thanking your customers for and tell them what to expect next.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t be afraid to bullet out a few of your offer\u2019s highlights to pack a value punch.<\/li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/28\/trigger-emails\">trigger emails<\/a> to send a follow up to your leads and customers post-action.<\/li>\n<li>Think about what you can add to your thank you page as \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d like a discount code, downloadable coupon, or any other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">sales promotion<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Treat your thank you page as you would a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/02\/landing-page-tips-and-tricks\">landing page<\/a>!
