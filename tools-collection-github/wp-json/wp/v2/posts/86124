However, you can only show one search ad at a time.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say a user searches for \u201cled lightbulbs.\u201d That could match to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your generic lightbulb search campaign, which has the keyword \u201clightbulb.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Your discount lightbulb search campaign, which has the keyword [led lightbulbs on sale].<\/li>\n<li>Your dynamic ad group in a search campaign, which has ad targets on all of your LED lightbulb product pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How will Google determine which campaign \u201cwins\u201d and shows an ad?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where keyword prioritization comes in. When multiple ads are eligible to match to a user\u2019s query, an elaborate AI-powered keyword prioritization occurs to determine which campaign, ad group, keyword, and ad are \u201cput forward\u201d into the auction, to compete for that user\u2019s click.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d Optimize your keyword list to align with your business&#8217;s priorities using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-keyword-prioritization-rules\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 things to know about the Google Ads keyword prioritization rules<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the five pillars of Google Ads keyword prioritization.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Exact match keywords get top priority<\/h3>\n<p>If you have an eligible exact match keyword identical to the user\u2019s query, it will be prioritized and enter the auction above any other keywords. Think of this like \u201cold school\u201d exact match still winning the day.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the definition of exact match today is that the user\u2019s query must match <em>the intent or meaning<\/em> of your keyword. For example, if you have the keyword [google ads tool], and the user searches for \u201cAdWords tool,\u201d that would be considered an exact match (close variant), since \u201c<em>google ads<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>adwords<\/em>\u201d are synonyms. According to keyword matching rules, you would be eligible to show an ad.<\/p>\n<p>But from a prioritization perspective, \u201c<em>google ads<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>Adwords<\/em>\u201d do not exactly match\u2014they are not identical. So, your [google ads tool] keyword would not automatically move forward to the auction, especially if you have a keyword like \u201c<em>adwords tool<\/em>\u201d or even \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>\u201d elsewhere in your account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-exact-match.webp\" alt=\"keyword prioritization - exact match\" width=\"664\" height=\"243\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86161 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-exact-match.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-exact-match-480x176.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. The only time exact match means an<em> identical<\/em> match<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>adwords tool<\/em>\u201d are not identical. But what about \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>google ads tools<\/em>,\u201d the singular versus plural? Or, \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>\u201d versus a 1-letter misspelling, such as \u201c<em>gogle ads tool<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While synonyms, misspellings, and plural iterations of keywords can all \u201cmatch\u201d to exact match keywords, they are treated differently when we\u2019re talking about keyword prioritization.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Synonyms (google ads versus adwords): Not an identical match, will not receive top priority if it matches an exact match keyword.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Misspellings<\/strong><strong> (google ads versus gogle ads):<\/strong> Considered an identical match, will receive top priority when it matches an exact match keyword.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plurals<\/strong><strong> (google ads tool versus google ads tools):<\/strong> Not an identical match, will not receive top priority if it matches an exact match keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what if we\u2019re evaluating \u201c<em>google ads<\/em>\u201d versus \u201c<em>google ad<\/em>,\u201d which could be considered a synonym, misspelling, or plural? Who knows!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m serious. The best piece of advice I can give you to wrap your head around keyword prioritization rules is to think of them as a helpful guide when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">planning your campaign structure<\/a>, but acknowledge that no matter what, this will all be a bit fuzzy in practice.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Phrase match, broad match, and search themes share second place<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we understand that exact match keywords get top priority when the keyword is identical to the user\u2019s search, what happens when you don\u2019t have an identical exact match keyword?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ehanced-cpc-going-away\">Google Ads<\/a> will look for a phrase match keyword, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/03\/broad-match-type\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broad match<\/a> keyword, or a Performance Max search theme that is identical to the user\u2019s search.<\/p>\n<p>When we say \u201cidentical,\u201d the same rules apply as above: the actual letters and words of your keyword\/search themes exactly match what the user typed, including misspellings, not including synonyms or plurals.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if the user searches for \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>,\u201d and you have the keywords in your account [<em>google ads<\/em>] and \u201c<em>google ads tol<\/em>,\u201d and the Performance Max search theme \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>,\u201d the phrase match misspelled keyword \u201c<em>google ads tol<\/em>\u201d and the Performance Max search theme \u201c<em>google ads tool<\/em>\u201d would be prioritized. The exact match non-identical keyword [google ads] is not an option for this auction.<\/p>\n<p>In this example, which ad would move forward to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/16\/how-adwords-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads auction<\/a>: the search ad with the misspelled phrase match keyword, or the Performance Max ad with the identical search theme?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-broad-match.webp\" alt=\"google ads keyword prioritization - phrase and broad match\" width=\"664\" height=\"215\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86162 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-broad-match.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-broad-match-480x155.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Ad rank still matters in Google Ads\u2014a lot<\/h3>\n<p>When you have multiple keywords or search themes at the same prioritization level, the one with the highest ad rank will move forward to the auction.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/1722122?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What\u2019s ad rank, again<\/a>? The simplified answer for our purposes right now is that ad rank is a calculation of your bids and your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a>. The higher your bids, the higher your ad rank, and the more likely you are to enter the auction (and, hopefully, win the auction). The higher the quality of your ads, the more likely you are to enter and win the auction as well.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, when multiple campaigns in your account are eligible to show an ad and sit at the same prioritization level, the one with the higher ad rank will move forward to the auction and compete to show your ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-keyword-prioritization-ad-rank.webp\" alt=\"keyword prioritization - ad rank\" width=\"664\" height=\"197\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86163 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-keyword-prioritization-ad-rank.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-keyword-prioritization-ad-rank-480x142.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. AI-powered keyword prioritization: the newest part<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t talk about new Google Ads features anymore without <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talking about AI<\/a>, so let\u2019s dig into how artificial intelligence powers keyword prioritization today.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest: although we\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing what happens with identical matches, the most likely scenario in your account is going to be that the user\u2019s search is <em>not identical <\/em>to an existing keyword or search theme. This means it <em>could<\/em> match to many of your keywords, search themes, and dynamic ad targets.<\/p>\n<p>Enter AI. AI-based keyword prioritization will look at every eligible kind of targeting in your account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keywords<\/li>\n<li>Dynamic ad targets<\/li>\n<li>Search themes<\/li>\n<li>Performance Max campaigns without search themes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and choose the most relevant ones to be considered in the auction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRelevant\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201chow identical it is to the keyword.\u201d Relevant also doesn\u2019t mean <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6167118?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad relevance<\/a>, the component of Quality Score that looks at the relationship between the user\u2019s search and your ad.<\/p>\n<p>For AI-based keyword prioritization, relevance looks at the <em>meaning<\/em> of the user\u2019s search, all the keywords in an ad group, and the landing pages within the ad group. From there, machine learning would figure out which ad is most likely to entice that user\u2019s click.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-ai.webp\" alt=\"keyword prioritization - ai\" width=\"664\" height=\"349\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86160 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-ai.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/keyword-prioritization-ai-480x252.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Get ideas to optimize your account&#8217;s keyword lists and more with our free<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-keyword-prioritization-means\"><\/div>\n<h2>What this means: 3 implications of the Google Ads keyword prioritization rules<\/h2>\n<p>Full disclosure: we are now shifting from Google Ads facts to Jyll Saskin Gales&#8217; opinions. There are many potential implications of Google\u2019s keyword prioritization rules. Here are three I\u2019d like you to consider:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Lack of control in keyword prioritization<\/h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have less control than you think<\/strong> over what searches you advertise on. Those that embrace automation with a consolidated campaign structure, providing sufficient budget and data integration to power Google\u2019s AI, will see better results over the long term than those that attempt to cling to control. Sure, you could respond to this news by adding thousands of exact match keywords to your account and manually bidding, but you will spend all your time battling negatives and fiddling with bid adjustments, fighting the machine rather than getting the machine working for you. That doesn\u2019t sound like fun or success to me.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Dynamic Search Ads are less of a priority<\/h3>\n<p>Second, <strong>Dynamic Search Ads are shafted<\/strong> in prioritization. For the record, they are also shafted in the search campaign setup process. You can\u2019t create a dynamic ad group in the current Search campaign setup process; you can only add one <em>after<\/em> the campaign has been created with a standard ad group. Given this and the fact that the search component of Performance Max is already powered by DSAs, I predict that dynamic ad groups will be \u201cupgraded\u201d to Performance Max soon. If you\u2019re an advertiser who leverages a lot of DSAs, you may want to start testing alternate strategies, like broad-match keywords with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> responsive search ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Ad rank still matters<\/h3>\n<p>Third, <strong>ad rank is still one of the most important factors <\/strong>in Google Ads success. While factors like auction competition, user context, and ad assets all matter too, it&#8217;s important to remember that you have the most control over are still your bids and your Quality Score to improve your ad rank regardless of the queries you match with. That\u2019s the funny thing about Google Ads\u2014as much as features and tools change over time, the fundamentals, like Quality Score and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bid strategy<\/a>, still remain the same.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-ad-rank-formula.webp\" alt=\"google ads ad rank formula\" width=\"900\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86159 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-ad-rank-formula.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-ad-rank-formula-480x151.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>When optimizing your keyword lists, consider Google Ads keyword prioritization<\/h2>\n<p>It can be easy to only focus on your keyword match type mix without considering how Google Ads keyword prioritization can also impact what queries your ads match with.
