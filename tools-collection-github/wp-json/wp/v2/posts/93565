You know your core business inside and out. But launching a brand requires you to take on other tasks, like marketing, that may feel foreign and, frankly, intimidating.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a small business logo is one of the earliest and most crucial marketing decisions you\u2019ll make. And for those small business owners who aren\u2019t designers by trade, there are two ways to approach the task.<\/p>\n<p>One is to hire a graphic designer. These professionals understand the ins and outs of color, fonts, proportion, and other design theories that help them effortlessly create a clean, effective logo. Other business owners opt to go it alone, relying on design tools to help them craft their logo.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the path you choose, this guide can help.

It\u2019s not clearly connected to your business.

Either way, these steps can guide the process.<\/p>\n<p>Learn the basics about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/brand-perception\">representing your brand visually<\/a>, so you can have more informed conversations with your professional graphic designer or apply them yourself.<\/p>\n<div id=\"know-your-brand-identity\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Know your brand identity<\/h3>\n<p>In order to represent your brand visually, you must know how to articulate your brand identity.<\/p>\n<p>Defining it starts with answering two simple questions: \u201cWhat do we do, and why do we do it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This question will lead you to your brand\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\" rel=\"noopener\">mission statement<\/a>, which encompasses how, what, and why you do your work. This can include tangible and intangible benefits for your customers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a test prep business might literally help students perform better on their SATs. But it also helps them feel more confident on test day. And when that confidence contributes to higher scores, they gain access to more opportunities in higher education.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/foley-prep-logo-example.webp\" alt=\"foley prep logo small business example\" width=\"900\" height=\"280\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93618\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/foley-prep-logo-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/foley-prep-logo-example-480x149.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/foleyprep.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This<\/a> colorful logo makes test prep look exciting\u2014like an opportunity to expand one\u2019s mind.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your brand\u2019s mission will help you home in on other elements of your identity. If your test prep company wants to inspire confidence in its students, then your identity might be that of an enthusiastic coach or an encouraging older sibling.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, consider your brand identity in contrast with your competitors. How does the work you do (and the way you do it) stand out from what they do?<\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <strong>Need help articulating what makes your business special?<\/strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"look-to-other-brands-for-inspiration\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Look to other brands for inspiration<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have a handle on your brand identity, you can look outward. How do brands you admire represent <em>their <\/em>identities visually through their logos?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s plenty of inspiration to pull from multinational brands with instantly recognizable logos. How does a well-designed logo convey feelings or values through design?<\/p>\n<p>For example, the Nike swoosh is an abstract shape. But it mimics a checkmark and implies upward motion. It is simple and bold, which conveys grace and confidence. These are all attributes that help an athlete shine on the court or field, which ties directly into Nike\u2019s mission of empowering athletes to \u201cJust do it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can also consider logos from smaller brands you admire. Looking to your peers can help you identify themes that resonate with your audience, or you may spot a visual white space your logo can fill.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp\" alt=\"small business logo - two sparrows homestead\" width=\"900\" height=\"417\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example-480x222.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TwoSparrowsHomestead\/about\/?_rdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This<\/a> logo\u2019s old-fashioned, hand-crafted feel leans into the business\u2019s identity as a \u201csuburban farmhouse.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As an example, if you\u2019re opening a gift shop in a seaside town, how many of your competitors have a blue logo with ocean-related imagery? If you opt to take a different visual path, you stand out immediately from your peers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"start-aligning-your-brand-with-design-elements\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Start aligning your brand with design elements<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve defined what your brand represents, how can you use visual elements to convey that message?<\/p>\n<p>Return to your brand identity discussions. As you think about what your brand represents and what you want your customers to feel, how does that translate into your brand\u2019s visual identity?<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/industries\/professional-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">law firm<\/a> might want its clients to feel safe, confident, and heard. That might mean it wants its visuals to convey trustworthiness and authority?<\/p>\n<p>How can you use design elements like font, color, and graphics to evoke those feelings?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with fonts. While there are thousands of individual fonts, they can be broken down into a handful of high-level categories, each of which has its own aesthetic vibe.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp\" alt=\"logo fonts and their meanings chart\" width=\"900\" height=\"617\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/log-fonts-and-meanings-480x329.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, consider color. Different shades, hues, tints, and tones all have the power to awaken specific feelings in viewers. A pastel pink feels gentle and soothing, while a neon pink feels electric and energetic.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the psychology of color (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/12\/color-psychology-marketing\">how to use it<\/a> in your logo) can help you spark immediate emotional resonance in anyone who sees it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp\" alt=\"color psychology and emotional triggers\" width=\"723\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp 723w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/color-psychology-emotional-triggers-480x531.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 723px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.conversioner.com\/blog\/color-psychology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Last up are graphics. Do you want your logo to include an icon, drawing, or image? When considering your options, think again about how the image style ties into your brand identity.<\/p>\n<p>A cartoon might feel whimsical and playful, while an icon can convey a more serious tone. You can also experiment with different degrees of representation in your image.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a yoga studio might opt for a line drawing of a yogi sitting in the lotus position. Or if they wanted to be slightly less representational, they might select an icon of a lotus flower.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/posies-logo-example.webp\" alt=\"small business logo example - posies\" width=\"310\" height=\"452\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93622\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/posies-logo-example.webp 310w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/posies-logo-example-206x300.webp 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/posies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Posies<\/a>, a local flower shop with bright and modern bouquets, designed a logo in fuchsia with an all-lowercase sans-serif font.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 <strong>Speaking of psychology in marketing\u2026<\/strong> Get our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download\">26 Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting (with Examples)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"understand-logo-types\"><\/div>\n<h3>4.

Or, ask your professional graphic designer to work their magic!<\/p>\n<p>This part can be tricky for those without a professional background in design, but graphic design tools with AI features can help.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva<\/a> now invites users to describe an idea with words and uses AI to present options that suit the brief. The tool allows for back-and-forth, so you can ask Canva to refine its initial output until you\u2019re happy with the results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp\" alt=\"canva logo builder ai example\" width=\"900\" height=\"628\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93623\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/canva-logo-builder-ai-example-480x335.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A conversation with Canva AI, asking it to create potential logos for a fictitious residential construction firm.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"pick-a-design-and-create-a-set-of-logos\"><\/div>\n<h3>6.
