Think about what gets you excited about your product that makes it different from your competitors\u2019 products. It might be careful construction, ethically sourced materials, or all the bells and whistles you dreamed up over drinks one night. Those are features.<\/p>\n<p>Now, think about what those things do for your customer. Does careful construction mean that your product is safe for children? Do ethically sourced materials make the buyer feel good about purchasing your product? Do those bells and whistles make everyone who sees your customer with your product weep with envy? Those are benefits.<\/p>\n<p>In product descriptions, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of only describing the features of your products. But when you just list the features, you\u2019re not actually helping your buyer understand how your product will help them.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about a product page that communicates both features and benefits effectively.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-descriptions-weber-grill.jpg\" alt=\"product description for a Weber grill\" width=\"630\" height=\"454\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.weber.com\/US\/en\/grills\/gas-grills\/spirit-ii-series\/44010001.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Weber<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Open your door to the world of grilling with the sleek Spirit II E-210 gas grill.

But we\u2019re urban apartment dwellers with no space for a BBQ.<\/p>\n<p>The product description for this grill speaks to the target market (me!) by expressing how its main features address my need for a grill that can squeeze into a tiny balcony space.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Benefit<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u201cSleek&#8230;two-burner grill built for small spaces\u201d<\/td>\n<td>\u201cThe perfect size to grill up a couple of burgers for everyone in the family\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u201cConvenient side tables\u2026\u201d<\/td>\n<td>\u201c&#8230;for placing serving trays\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>\u201cPacked with [branded] features\u201d<\/em><\/td>\n<td><em>\u201cWelcome to the Weber family\u201d<\/em><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>See how the copy addresses the same primary buyer need multiple times?

The product description repeats that the grill is small and has side serving trays (features) to maximize my small space while making enough food for everyone (benefit).<\/p>\n<p>And see the last example, in italics? The copywriter also knows that I have both <em>practical <\/em>needs and <em>emotional <\/em>ones.

This is slightly thinner than the other wild hemp fabric in this item and because of its past use is beautifully soft. This front pocket can accommodate your laptop charger as well as a note book\/pens etc. making it super convenient.<\/p>\n<p>No Chemicals or Chemical Dyes<br \/>\nWe use only natural plant\/mineral based dyes.<br \/>\nWe use no bleach or other chemical treatments or dyes in our production process.<br \/>\nThe fibres are hand-harvested, washed in pure Himalayan water and hand-spun, weaved and stitched.<\/p>\n<p>SUPPORTING RURAL LIVELIHOODS IN NEPAL<br \/>\nWe work with a small group of Nepali handcrafters and local communities harvesting wild fibres to bring you these yoga accessories.

Where it really shines is the explanation of how the traditional materials aren\u2019t just beautiful, but are also practical.

Tell a story<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love a good story? Bedtime stories, ghost stories, war stories, tragic star-crossed lover stories, that-awkward-thing-I-got-mocked-for-in-middle-school stories. Telling stories, both to ourselves and others, is part of what makes us human. It\u2019s also a powerful marketing tool, especially for your product descriptions.<\/p>\n<p>This description below does so much more than introduce a backpack and explain how many items it can hold. It tells (you guessed it) a story.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-descriptions-thinkgeek-backpack.jpg\" alt=\"product description for a backpack\" width=\"678\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkgeek.com\/product\/lghk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>ThinkGeek<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>ENDOR COMMANDO<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially-licensed Star Wars merchandise<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes blending in is the best plan<\/li>\n<li>Big enough for your Ewok BFF<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pack it up! We&#8217;re deploying to Endor in the morning, and you need to find a bag big enough for the essentials with extra space for a small teddy-bear like lifeform. Hypothetically. We&#8217;re not telling you to take an Ewok back with you, but\u2026 if you find your Ewok BFF, you&#8217;ll have the option.<\/p>\n<p>This Star Wars Rebel Alliance Special Forces Rucksack is big enough to fit everything you need for your day, and then some (including an Ewok). The camo accents will make it harder for the Stormtroopers to spot you on Endor which is a huge plus, especially considering their rucksacks are (you guessed it) white. Sometimes standing out is the worst thing you can do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Product Specifications<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Star Wars Rebel Alliance Special Forces Rucksack<\/li>\n<li>Officially-licensed Star Wars merchandise<\/li>\n<li>Includes roll-top, 2 front zipper pockets, and 2 zippered side pockets\u00a0 Endor Commando Alliance Special Forces patch is prominently featured on the front<\/li>\n<li>Features faux Aurebesh on the side pocket (it would say &#8220;Restore the Republic&#8221;, but each letter is backwards) &#8211; you don&#8217;t want EVERYONE to know your true mission, do you?<\/li>\n<li>Also shows the Rebel Alliance symbol<\/li>\n<li>If you put an Ewok in the bag, don\u2019t roll the top down too tight<\/li>\n<li>Adjustable shoulder straps<\/li>\n<li>Materials: Polyester, faux leather (vegan), and silicone strap closure<\/li>\n<li>Dimensions: 18&#8243; tall x 12&#8243; wide x 5&#8243; deep<\/li>\n<li>Care Instructions: Wipe clean with a damp cloth<\/li>\n<li>Weight: 2 lb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WARNING &#8211; ENTANGLEMENT HAZARD. Keep away from very young children. Do not place around neck.\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead of telling you \u201cthis backpack will make you feel like you\u2019re in Star Wars,\u201d the copywriter instead tells a story that makes you imagine that you\u2019re in Star Wars already\u2014before you even buy the product. One of the bullet-point features promises that the backpack can fit your Ewok BFF, and this is recalled in the description below. In the middle of the standard specs at the end of the description, between the dimensions and weight, is a final note on carrying your Ewok BFF in this backpack: \u201cIf you put an Ewok in the bag, don\u2019t roll the top down too tight.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What does this Ewok BFF narrative actually tell you about the product? Nothing, really.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But the story is there because this product description puts the customer first. <\/strong>We buy stuff, in general, because we think stuff will make our lives better. And we buy merch in particular because attaching a beloved brand to our identity makes us feel better about ourselves. (Yep, we\u2019re going deep here.) If you\u2019re 10, you might actually want to be Princess Leia and buy this backpack to feel like you\u2019re her. If you\u2019re 30, you might want to reclaim part of your childhood or perhaps take on the rebel persona to feel more confident in the real battles you do face every day. Either way, you want to feel like a character in Star Wars.<\/p>\n<h3>How to tell your customers a story<\/h3>\n<p>Jot down some ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What story would ignite your buyer\u2019s imagination? How can your product support that story?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your buyer\u2019s underlying emotional or psychological need for this product? What stories could you tell that tap into or meet this need? How could that story feature your product?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And then start drafting!<\/p>\n<div id=\"surprise-and-delight\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Surprise and delight your potential customers<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re writing your product descriptions for your customers, you want to give them all the necessary information about the product so they can make an informed decision. But you also want to keep your customers engaged and write an on-brand product description that leaves a warm, fuzzy, and lasting impression.<\/p>\n<p>How can you do that? By surprising and delighting your potential customers with a cute and creative product description. Let\u2019s take a look at my last example.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-descriptions-loveco.jpg\" alt=\"product description for candles\" width=\"662\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelovestruckco.com\/shop\/unicorn-fart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>LoveStruckCo<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Smells like unicorns farting pleasantly in your face.<\/p>\n<p>|Notes of lemons, limes, cherries, grapefruits, berries and vanilla|<\/p>\n<p>*No two Unicorn Farts are the same. Each one is unique.<br \/>\n**No unicorns were harmed in the making of this candle. All unicorns are fed an organic diet of sugar and love.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>(I promise I\u2019m not five years old. #sorrynotsorry)<\/p>\n<p>Take in this beauty of a description. It\u2019s short. No words are wasted. It bursts with helpful information about how to use and care for the product. It doesn\u2019t just list details about the ingredients (\u201cphthalates free\u201d), but explains <em>why <\/em>the buyer should care about this (\u201cdoes not pollute your home&#8230;supports American farmers.\u201d) And at its end, it leaves you with a feeling: \u201cYou can feel good burning Love Struck Co. candles in your home!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, LoveStruckCo., for reminding us all that we can.<\/p>\n<h3>How to surprise and delight with your product descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Grab pens and paper, a colleague, and a fun snack (not optional), and start brainstorming! Answer the following questions based on what you know about your customers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do they expect from your product? How can you upend that expectation?<\/li>\n<li>If they won\u2019t have any concrete expectations for your product, could you build expectation with the product title and then upend that expectation in the description?<\/li>\n<li>What would make them laugh? Is their humor silly, dry, ironic, or witty?<\/li>\n<li>What common memories or experiences might your customer base share? (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelovestruckco.com\/shop\/boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This description from LoveStruckCo<\/a> is a good example of this.) How can you trigger this memory?<\/li>\n<li>What would make your customer base compulsively \u201cawwww,\u201d cheer, or punch the air?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"product-description-checklist\">\n<a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#product-description-checklist\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewBox=\"0 0 14 14\" style=\"\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\" style=\"\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>A product description checklist<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you remember anything from this blog post, remember this: <strong>Write product descriptions that serve your customers.<\/strong> Meet your customers where they are.
