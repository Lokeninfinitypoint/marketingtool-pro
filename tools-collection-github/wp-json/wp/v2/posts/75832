Create and manage your Google Business Profile\u2019s merchant photos<\/h3>\n<p>For your Google Ads\u2019 location assets to feature your business\u2019s images, you\u2019ll first need to upload at least one merchant photo to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Business Profile<\/a>.

Your logo icon will appear alongside any posts from your profile or anytime you respond to a question or review.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cover photo: <\/strong>Your cover photo is the money shot \u2013 this photo is most likely to show up first in your Google Business Profile listing and will be used the most in your Google location assets images.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Photo: <\/strong>These are supplementary photos that will show in your Google Business Profile listing. They\u2019re often visible alongside your Cover photo, so it\u2019s worth including at least several different and dynamic images of your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Remove outdated photos<\/h3>\n<p>If your business photos are outdated or poor quality, you can also remove any old photos from your Google Business Profile. Just log into your Google Business Profile and select anywhere in the photos section. Navigate to the \u201cBy owner\u201d section and select the photo you wish to remove. In the top right corner, you should be able to select a trash can \u201cdelete\u201d icon to remove it from your profile.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image.jpg\" alt=\"location assets enhancement - remove google business image from profile\" width=\"936\" height=\"572\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75844\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image-480x293.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udea8 Are your Google Ads missing the mark?

Prioritize a high-quality cover photo<\/h3>\n<p>Your cover photo will usually be shown first and most prominently on the SERP, alongside your GBP, and now alongside your Google Ads. Ensure that your cover photo best represents the image of your brand and is accurate to your business. Use proper lighting, focus, and minimal alterations. Google recommends your cover photo to be at least 720 x 720 in size.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg\" alt=\"location assets enhancements - example of ad with image as part of location asset\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75848\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Include a variety of different photos<\/h3>\n<p>Your cover photo may get the most attention, but it won\u2019t always show alone. A prospective visitor is likely to browse several images online before visiting in person. Consider including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Several exterior images: <\/strong>To help customers recognize your business as they approach. Include different images to highlight how your storefront looks from different directions, parking and transit options, as well as how your business looks at night.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interior images: <\/strong>To highlight the atmosphere that customers should expect in your store. Highlight color product displays, seasonal areas, waiting rooms, common areas, and amenities that customers may want to see.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Staff photos: <\/strong>To highlight your great team and present a more personal side of your business. Authentic photos that show your team working together earns trust in your business. Avoid including formal headshots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-best-practices-images.jpg\" alt=\"example of google business images for boston real estate agent\" width=\"533\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-best-practices-images.jpg 533w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-best-practices-images-480x539.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 533px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Make sure your listings are up to par with LocaliQ&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Business Listings Grader<\/a> \u2705<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>3. Create a Google Ads Logo asset<\/h3>\n<p>Your Google Business Profile will highlight your logo alongside your posts and responses automatically. You also highlight that same logo alongside all your Google ads to reinforce your brand consistently on the SERP. Creating a logo asset is a simple and effective way to improve your ads performance, but you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/13\/google-advertiser-verification\">verify your Google Ads account<\/a> before you can implement it.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg\" alt=\"location assets - google logo asset\" width=\"701\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75838\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg 701w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset-480x411.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Enhance your ads with image assets<\/h3>\n<p>Your location assets and images from your Google Business Profile will automatically appear when a user is searching for you locally\u2013but searchers outside of your area may not always see these assets.<\/p>\n<p>Include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/21\/google-ads-image-extensions\">image assets<\/a> in your Google Ads campaigns to provide more visual aspects to your search ads, whether or not a user is searching locally or not. Image assets are also more flexible and don\u2019t need to be directly related to your physical location.<\/p>\n<p>Use them to highlight images of more seasonal events, sales, products, and services that wouldn\u2019t always be appropriate to be prominently displayed on your Google Business Profile.<\/p>\n<h2>How to opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Some businesses won\u2019t always have the most aesthetic Google Business Profile photos and may want to opt out of including photos of their location within Google Ads. Luckily for them, these new features for location assets can be turned off and allow advertisers to just show their location alongside their ad without any photos.<\/p>\n<p>To opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Within Google Ads, select \u201cAds and Assets\u201d from the left-hand bar, then select \u201cAssets.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Under the \u201cAssociations view,\u201d select the 3-dot \u201cMore\u201d icon. Then select \u201cAccount-level automated assets.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>From this view, select the three-dot \u201cMore\u201d icon again. Now select the option \u201cAdvanced settings\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Under \u201cAutomatic locations,\u201d there is a check box to \u201cGrant Google Ads license to use merchant photos and other rich media from the linked Google Business Profiles in the advertising campaigns from this account.\u201d Unselect this option and hit save. This will prevent Google from pulling any photos from your Google Business Profile to serve alongside your ads.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Show off your business images in location assets<\/h2>\n<p>These new enhancements to location assets should be valuable for local advertisers and help their ads stick out from their competition on the SERP. As these features continue to roll out to more advertisers, now is a perfect time to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/optimize-google-my-business-listing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review your Google Business Profile<\/a> and ensure your business is prominently displayed in local searches.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Ads new enhancement to location assets pulls an image from a business&#8217;s Google Business Profile into its ad.
