One of our clients, a large retailer, was experiencing a spring slump, something that happens to many retailers after the\u00a0holiday season. The client was concerned because, in the low season without any big flash sales, the only people we saw making purchases were those who had been customers in the past. This audience was considered their loyal customer base\u2014and it was small.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your loyal customers are the ones who are going to buy your products even if they aren\u2019t on sale <\/strong>and recommend your offerings to friends, and you always want that audience to be large enough to keep you afloat.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Customer Loyalty &amp; Why is it Important?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/18\/loyalty-marketing\">Customer loyalty<\/a> is a measure of how likely your customers are to do repeat business with you.<\/p>\n<p>Different industries have various ways of measuring loyalty, but the most basic way is to look at the number of purchases over a customer\u2019s lifetime in your database. Repeat buyers are your <em>most valuable<\/em> customers. Though they may not be big purchasers, it is likely that over time, the revenue from them will top revenue from big one-time buyers.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-build-customer-loyalty.png\" alt=\"Ways to Earn Customer Loyalty\" width=\"780\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In fact, only a <a href=\"http:\/\/epmsonline.com\/customer-loyalty\/what-is-customer-loyalty\">5% improvement in customer retention rates<\/a> yields between 25% to 100% increase in profits across industries\u2014happy customers spend more money, more often.

Know Your Customer and Let Them Know You<\/h2>\n<p>One of my favorite things is when I meet someone once, and the next time I see them, they remember my name and a detail about our last conversation. This is important for customer loyalty! Companies should strive to dio this with their customers. Admittedly, it is easy to say, but much harder to do.<\/p>\n<h3>Send \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d &amp; Other Personalized Emails<\/h3>\n<p>Customers are more likely to be loyal if they feel valued; do you remember their birthdays, or their kids\u2019 ages, or the last item they purchased? Many retailers have implemented triggered<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/31\/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas\"> email programs<\/a> which will send birthday emails and discounts during a customer\u2019s birthday month and customized pregnancy planning emails\/first year of life for new and expectant moms. Everyone loves a birthday treat!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ikea-customer-loyalty.png\" alt=\"How to Build Customer Loyalty\" width=\"928\" height=\"614\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It is almost as important to be transparent with your customers about your business. Are you going through a rough patch with getting shipments out on time? Let them know. Did you just hire a new CEO or release an awesome new product? Send a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized announcement to your customers<\/a>, giving them a heads-up before the news gets to the media. Even better, release it to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/07\/customer-engagement-strategy\">engaged, loyal customers<\/a> first in beta to get honest feedback.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we assign customer service reps to specific accounts to assist through their initial transition onto our platform through the customer lifecycle. This allows a rep to get to know the client\u2019s business and business goals, to better assist them. We also send hand-written \u201cWelcome to WordStream\u201d cards from our reps to all new clients! These clients are important to us and we want to let them know.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/17\/customer-insights\">find more ways to uncover and apply customer insights here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Customer Loyalty Tip #2. Reward Loyalty with a Customer Loyalty Program<\/h2>\n<p>Loyalty programs are one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">effective customer retention strategies<\/a> out there.<\/p>\n<h3>Card-Based Customer Loyalty Programs<\/h3>\n<p>Confession: I have way too many credit cards. Every time I\u2019m on an airplane or in a retail store and they ask if I\u2019m part of their customer rewards program, I cave. Spend $1000 in the first month and get $200 back! What a deal! And then I\u2019m stuck with a credit card that <em>needs<\/em> to rack up a $1000 charge. It sounds like a tricky way to lock in your customer, but if you are honest about the implications, credit card rewards programs can be great.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not into credit cards, take a page out of Starbucks\u2019 book. Customers earn stars with their purchases, with opportunities to double their rewards certain days of the month and graduate to tiers of loyalty. All you need is a Starbucks gift card and a smartphone. This rewards program also helps Starbucks get to know their customers better by storing all their order and payment information in the app\u2014never have your name misspelled on your Starbucks cup again!<\/p>\n<h3>Try Punch Cards<\/h3>\n<p>If credit cards are too much of a commitment, an easier way to reward loyal customers is through punch cards. At WordStream, the caf\u00e9 in our building has stamp cards. After you get 10 stamps from 10 purchases, you get something free! I find a lot of frozen yogurt and consignment shops like Plato\u2019s Closet do this as well. It\u2019s a good way to keep customers coming back to your specific store as opposed to the caf\u00e9 down the street.<\/p>\n<h2>Customer Loyalty Tip #3. Make Customer Loyalty Easier<\/h2>\n<h3>Store Customer Data<\/h3>\n<p>Always a good example of customer loyalty, an aspect of Starbucks\u2019 reward program is the option to order and pay on your mobile device. I love when I\u2019m purchasing yet another book for my Kindle and I don\u2019t have to put in my credit card information. This one-touch ordering tells me that Amazon knows who I am (they probably don\u2019t) and they\u2019re kindly helping me out by getting me offline as soon as possible!<\/p>\n<p>To look at it from a different perspective, Apple also does this. With each upgrade, the iPhone strives to make the user\u2019s life a little simpler\u2014anything from the easy-access to the camera on the lock screen, to the accessibility double-tap on the home button for people with small hands. Apple is very public about presenting their new changes and how much work went into the updates, despite not offering discounts, resulting in a loyal following.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Use of Automation<\/h3>\n<p>Personally, my favorite \u201cmake it easier\u201d experience is with my cable company\u2014shocking, I know. I called them to complain about our internet speed and I was directed to the right person by my phone number\u2014didn\u2019t even have to type in a long account number! The customer service representative made it clear that she saw and understood the problem, which resulted in a technician coming to replace our router at a conveniently scheduled time later that week. After he left, the same representative called me to make sure everything was working. That\u2019s great! I barely had to do anything but pick up the phone and dial!<\/p>\n<h2>Customer Loyalty Tip #4. Be the Best at What You Do<\/h2>\n<p>An easy way to build customer loyalty is to simply be the best out there. There are so many brands that I love, but I just can\u2019t justify the cost of shopping with all of them. Or, it\u2019s cheap but doesn\u2019t last. When I asked my co-workers, which brands they considered themselves to be loyal to, the response was a resounding: \u201cTJ Maxx!\u201d That makes sense to me! Not just because we\u2019re in Boston, headquarters of TJX, but because TJX offers great brands at affordable prices, and they are also one of the only companies out there that have mastered that. We\u2019re all Maxxinistas!<\/p>\n<h3>Make Your Value Prop Part of Your Brand<\/h3>\n<p>Another brand mentioned was Patagonia. Patagonia has competition, like REI and Eagle Creek Outfitters, but they have a great story and provide a good shopping experience (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">great value proposition<\/a>)\u2014good return policies, a founder and employees who truly love the outdoors, even a unique business model that was popularized through the publication of <em>Let My People Go Surfing<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/patagonia-customer-loyalty.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Company personality\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nobody is perfect, so a great alternative to <em>being<\/em> the best is showing your customers that you are constantly striving to improve. Everyone appreciates the\u00a0effort, which leads me to\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Customer Loyalty Tip #5. Encourage Customer Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>Customer reviews go hand-in-hand with customer loyalty. Good reviews will drive prospects to your business, good service will convert prospects into customers, and satisfied customers will leave good reviews!<\/p>\n<p>The first step in this chicken-and-egg cycle is good service.\u00a0 Make sure anyone in the company who is client-facing is paying attention to their needs and acting to work through any snafus. You can also provide great customer service through channels like Twitter and customer portals. After an issue is resolved or a transaction is complete, reach out to ask about your customer\u2019s experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Ask for Reviews by Email<\/h3>\n<p>Though this is an annoying example of customer loyalty (as a customer), another way to ask for reviews is through automated email programs\u00a0like the birthday triggered emails. Once a customer has made a certain number of purchases, send a prompt to review the company for a special discount. If you work with clients, include them in your NPS surveys.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/kate-spade-customer-loyalty.png\" alt=\"Kate Spade Customer Survey\" width=\"697\" height=\"759\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Customer engagement and loyalty are two essential\u00a0components of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">growth marketing<\/a>.\u00a0If you have tried and true ways to generate customer loyalty that we forgot, please let us know!
