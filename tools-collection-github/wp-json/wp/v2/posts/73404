But then Bing lets you fill in all the juicy details like hours of operation and so forth. The really cool bit is that you can just import all of that data right from your Google Business profile to save time.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re up and running, you\u2019ll be eligible for placement on Bing Search and Maps.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1.jpg\" alt=\"listings management tools - Bing map\" width=\"936\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73424 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1-480x292.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And bonus: You may even land yourself as the result in upcoming voice searches since Bing powers both Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Facebook Business Page<\/h3>\n<p>The social media website functions like a local business directory because <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-facebook-page-for-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Business Pages<\/a> often wind up in search engine results. Luckily, Facebook offers some tools that\u2019ll help you manage your page as if it were a local listing.<\/p>\n<h4>Location management<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s all about \u201clocation, location, location\u201d in local search results. So your Facebook page <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/add-location-to-facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">needs to be linked to a geographic location<\/a> for it to show up in \u201c&#8230;near me\u201d searches.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s Business Page tools let you do that in a few ways. First and foremost, you can add your address to your Page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map.jpg\" alt=\"Listings management tools - Facebook map\" width=\"563\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73425 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map.jpg 563w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map-480x507.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook also lets you tag posts and images\u2014on both desktop and mobile\u2014with a location. Then you can change the category of your business to one that works locally, like a plumber or hair stylist, so your business shows up when people filter for places, as opposed to people or posts.<\/p>\n<h3>6. The Real Yellow Pages<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, they\u2019re still around. In fact, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yellowpages.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YP website<\/a> claims 4 billion searches for local businesses on its website and app each year.

Foursquare<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.foursquare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foursquare<\/a> isn\u2019t what you think it is anymore. What was once a social media app for telling your friends which boba tea joint to find you in has become the location data provider for some of the largest geographic-dependent apps in the world (think: Uber and Nextdoor). So when you claim your business listing on Foursquare, you\u2019re giving your business more opportunities to show up in the apps that matter.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro.jpg\" alt=\"Listings management tools - Foursquare for business landing page\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73429 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Socially networked listings<\/h4>\n<p>Even though it doesn\u2019t operate like a social media platform anymore, there\u2019s still a network effect to the listings on Foursquare. In large part, that\u2019s due to the \u201ctips\u201d feature of the app.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2.jpg\" alt=\"Listings management tools - Foursquare tip from user\" width=\"658\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73430 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2.jpg 658w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2-480x438.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 658px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The idea is that customers can offer those little insider suggestions that help new visitors get the most out of their trip.<\/p>\n<p>The tips feature encourages people to add their favorite places to Foursquare, which means your local business may already have a citation there. You just need to <a href=\"https:\/\/foursquare.com\/venue\/claim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claim it<\/a> and fill in the details\u2014a task Foursquare makes easy with their listing management tool.<\/p>\n<h4>Individualized analytics<\/h4>\n<p>Like some of the other tools on this list, Foursquare also lets you track the analytics collected through each citation visit. But since people still check in to Foursquare leaving reviews and tips, the app has a lot of data about individual users. So you can not only tell how many people saw and clicked on your Foursquare listing, you can tell how often or how recently some of them walked through your door.<\/p>\n<h2>Why local listings management tools are important<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re using a tool like LocaliQ to manage many listings at once, or tackling each directory separately, listing management tools make it easy to view, manage, and track how you\u2019re seen in directories. Here are some more reasons listings management tools are so important in finding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/hot-leads-vs-cold-leads\">hot leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Increase online presence<\/h3>\n<p>Being present in online directories gets you access to more customers, can boost your SEO, and gives you more opportunities to collect reviews. That\u2019s pretty important since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/the-importance-of-online-customer-reviews-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72%<\/a> of consumers say positive reviews make them trust a business more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust.jpg\" alt=\"Listings management tools - graphic saying 72% of people say positive reviews make them trust businesses more\" width=\"936\" height=\"361\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73432 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust-480x185.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Millions of people use online directories to find local businesses. The more of those directories that include your business listing, the greater the chance you\u2019ll be found by new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Search engines also reward businesses that have more, fully optimized citations and reviews on trusted directories.<\/p>\n<p>Local listing management tools help you get cited on more directory websites and map apps.<\/p>\n<h3>Maintain correct listing information<\/h3>\n<p>Your business likely exists on many directories whether you put it there or not. That means the information displayed might be incorrect, out-of-date, and downright unflattering.<\/p>\n<p>All that bad information will frustrate customers and signal search engines that your business isn\u2019t trusted as your competitors (which we know isn\u2019t true!). In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/business-listings-trust-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">63%<\/a> of consumers say incorrect information would stop them from using that business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect.jpg\" alt=\"Listings management tools - graphic saying 63% of people don't use businesses with incorrect listings\" width=\"936\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73433 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect-480x190.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you use listing management tools, you can make sure your details are correct and even spice up your listings to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/17\/halloween-greetings-sayingsundefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attract more customers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Understand the trends<\/h3>\n<p>Many of the listing tools we\u2019ve reviewed provide analytics. This peak behind the directory curtain clues you in on who\u2019s visiting and where they\u2019re coming from.<\/p>\n<p>With these insights, you\u2019ll know which directories to focus on, which may need to be updated, and which delivers the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cheapest leads<\/a>. And if one directory seems to generate lots of reviews, it may lead you to spend on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/pay-per-click-advertising\">paid ads<\/a> there.<\/p>\n<h2>Get cited, found, and reviewed with listing management tools<\/h2>\n<p>Online directories have helped millions of people <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-leads-for-any-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">connect with local businesses<\/a> like yours.
