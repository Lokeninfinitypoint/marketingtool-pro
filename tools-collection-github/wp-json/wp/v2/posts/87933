But most of us market for SMBs, have limited budgets, and need to generate a lot from a little.<\/p>\n<p>I was delighted that the examples I got back have a healthy mix of big-brand bravado and small-business resourcefulness.

A multisensory ad you can \u201csmell\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve always thought selling things like perfume and air fresheners must be tough. Until we get smell-o-vision (\ud83e\udd22), you can\u2019t exactly share your product&#8217;s most important value proposition.<\/p>\n<p>But somehow, and I can\u2019t explain it, you can smell the candles in this Instagram ad that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kaleighmoore\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaleigh Moore<\/a>, a prolific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaleighmoore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freelance content writer<\/a>, showed me.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign.webp\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns - instagram ad for candles\" width=\"341\" height=\"574\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87935 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign.webp 341w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign-178x300.webp 178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DC1lTQLsryu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The scientific name for these sensory crossovers is synesthesia, and it can be hard to pull off.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis ad is great because it\u2019s simple, it creates a cozy feeling, and it keeps the focus on the product,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>Every aspect of the ad works together to create a very specific aesthetic. The background color, the track of nature sounds, and the ferns and rocks all direct your hearing and sight to tell your sense of smell what\u2019ll happen if you buy these candles. Even the copy (\u201cwarm embrace\u201d) reinforces the vibe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo many campaigns I\u2019ve seen are loud and distracting,\u201d Kaleigh says. \u201cThis ad aesthetically matches the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\">brand tone<\/a>. It\u2019s simple and elegant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Do you market a product that\u2019s difficult to express in digital form? Try connecting with other senses. Maybe it\u2019s the sensation of running your tongue across freshly cleaned teeth or the sound of sitting in your favorite leather chair\u2014feature those feelings in your ad.<\/p>\n<div id=\"an-ad-that-won-in-a-competitive-industry\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. An ad that won in a competitive industry<\/h3>\n<p>On average, it costs more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024\">$50<\/a> for a health and wellness brand to get a lead from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-targeting\">Facebook ads<\/a>. That makes it one of the most competitive industries in which to market on social media.<\/p>\n<p>To win in wellness advertising, you need a strong offer. You also need to make sure every person who spots your ad can instantly understand the offer.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/patrice-bagby\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrice Bagby<\/a>, Senior Social Advertising Manager at <a href=\"http:\/\/localiq.com\">LocaliQ<\/a>, pointed to these ads as excellent examples of how to sell in a competitive industry.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female.webp\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns - Facebook wellness ad.\" width=\"322\" height=\"577\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87936 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female.webp 322w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female-167x300.webp 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a couple of reasons these two ads performed very well for our client, Degree Wellness,\u201d Patrice explains. \u201cFirst, the photos are high quality, and the colors really pop out to grab your attention. This is important for a business like this in such a competitive field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Patrice said they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ab-testing-examples\">A\/B tested<\/a> both versions of the ads to make sure they\u2019d work for their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>, which was split between male and female clients. \u201cWe saw both audiences convert on these,\u201d Patrice says. \u201cWe&#8217;ve even seen women covert from the male ad, which just goes to show you never know what might work and should always TEST, TEST, TEST!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Getting eyes on the ads was important, but the real test was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/23\/facebook-ads-not-converting\">ensuring the ad converted those viewers<\/a>. Patrice said simplicity and consistency made this ad a high-converter. \u201cThe offer is what really matters. We added the deal as an overlay but nothing else. Sometimes, when you try to add too much, your message will get lost. Then, we highlighted it within the ad copy and made sure the offer was added to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>.

A campaign that stops you every time<\/h3>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t surprised to see a Progressive ad on this list, but I thought it might be Flo and her indomitable optimism for bundling policies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/srichtsmeier\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seth Richtsmeier<\/a>, an SEO pro and <a href=\"https:\/\/sethrich.journoportfolio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freelance writer<\/a>, pointed to a different Progressive promotion as one of his favorites in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy fave ad is the ongoing Dr. Rick campaign from Progressive.

Or you\u2019ve started doling out advice to strangers at the hardware store. At some point, we all see signs of parentamorphosis.<\/p>\n<p>The Dr. Rick character has taken on a life outside of ads. He\u2019s been on the show Hot Ones, has a YouTube channel, and has even published a book titled <em>Dr. Rick Will See You Now<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to go as big as Progressive. Just identify a trait, obstacle, or funny challenge your customers share, and talk about it in your ads.

An ad that doubles down on personalization<\/h3>\n<p>We all know how effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/personalized-marketing\">personalization<\/a> is in marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/milena-alexandrova\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Milena Alexandrova<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.milena-alexandrova.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">copywriter and fractional content manager<\/a>, likes this campaign from Camper because it personalized the whole product.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the madness of Black Friday, I think offering customers the option to customize their shoes is a fantastic way to get their attention,\u201d Milena says.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper.webp\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns - Shoe email ad from Camper\" width=\"573\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87939 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper.webp 573w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper-480x503.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 573px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Camper lets you mix and match to create up to 64 color combinations. \u201cThe brand\u2019s CamperLab series already makes you feel like you&#8217;re wearing personalized shoes because they&#8217;re so quirky and colorful, but this takes it a step further,\u201d Milena says.<\/p>\n<p>I especially love the visual Camper uses in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">marketing email<\/a>. It creates a sense of collaboration like you get to work as a shoe designer. I don\u2019t know if they do this, but it\u2019d be awesome if each image were personalized with the email subscriber\u2019s name.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI believe brands that aren&#8217;t doing this are missing a huge opportunity,\u201d Milena says. \u201cObviously, not all brands have the resources to offer this level of customization, but it can be done in plenty of different ways and still capture customers&#8217; attention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How can you customize what you sell? You could simply include a personalized tag with each item. Or, what if you created a personalized product bundle based on what someone bought in the past and called it the \u201cAlex pack?\u201d That could work for both products and services (like a massage business that added a particular aromatherapy and facial treatment to the bundle).<\/p>\n<div id=\"an-ad-that-hits-every-purschase-trigger\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. An ad that hits every purchasing trigger<\/h3>\n<p>The best ads target <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional triggers<\/a> that motivate action\u2014not in a clickbaity, sleazy way, but in a way that helps the viewer \u201cfeel\u201d that an offer can improve their lives.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/angelekasse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Angele Kasse<\/a>, a Social Media Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/agims.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AGI marketing<\/a>, shared an ad that touches on financial security, trust, family, and a sense of urgency.

First and foremost, ask yourself what the most compelling component of your offer is for the specific audience you\u2019re trying to reach. I may not consider creating a legacy for my family, but my target audience might. Place that benefit in the ad&#8217;s strongest, boldest, most contradictory colors.<\/p>\n<div id=\"an-ad-that-keeps-on-delivering\"><\/div>\n<h3>7.

Its pricing is based on a revenue-sharing model with those creators, which formed the basis of the direct financial support for Girls Who Code. \u201cThe initiative donated 100% of revenue shares during this period to help close the gender gap in technology and support future female coders,\u201d Goran says.<\/p>\n<p>A really cool \u201cwin-win\u201d aspect of the campaign was that the creators could also support the cause while gaining valuable exposure for their own businesses. \u201cThe campaign united over 50 businesses from the Freemius community of software makers who all had the opportunity to increase their sales right before the BFCM [<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/black-friday-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Friday<\/a> and Cyber Monday], as well as build a positive image around their brands by participating in a charity campaign and highlighting the importance of diversity in tech.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The team promoted the campaign through several channels, including using the branded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtag<\/a> #freemius10.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share.webp\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns - Facebook post for freemius campaign.\" width=\"345\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87944 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share.webp 345w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share-182x300.webp 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe campaign demonstrated how the software community can come together to create an impact and support the next generation of female technologists,\u201d Goran says.<\/p>\n<p>Campaigns like these are incredibly rewarding, extremely effective, and can be pretty easy to run. One simple process is to choose a cause, find a non-profit partner, offer a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">giveaway<\/a> or financial support, and promote it across your channels. As a little added bonus, you\u2019ll\u00a0<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">also gain some\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand awareness<\/a> with the non-profit\u2019s audience<\/span>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"a-consistent-campaign\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Bonus: A consistent campaign of hilarious social media posts<\/h3>\n<p>This one isn\u2019t a paid ad, but it is one of the best marketing efforts on the internet, in my humble opinion. It\u2019s a model of consistency in message, hilarity in tone, and creativity in visuals. Even better, it\u2019s from a government agency, the last place you\u2019d look for marketing inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>What am I talking about? The National Park Service Instagram page. It\u2019s one of my favorite accounts, so I\u2019ve made it my nomination for this list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps.webp\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns - NPs instagram post\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87945 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The consistent reminder to be safe in national parks is baked into the NPS posts.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The account has over 6 million followers. Many of its posts get over 100,000 likes and thousands of comments\u2014often congratulating the social media team.<\/p>\n<p>A fan favorite of the feed is Fat Bear Week. Every October, the NPS holds a contest for followers to vote on the floofiest ursine. It\u2019s an absolute engagement magnet as people jump in to place their vote and share via #fatbearweek.<\/p>\n<p>Amazing images and quippy copy are something we should all aspire to. But the real lesson here is consistency. You can see the persistent throughline of visitor safety and responsible stewardship of outdoor spaces connecting each message. Even the funny photos of fat bear rumps are a reminder that healthy animals mean a healthy planet. It\u2019s a great reminder to make sure your messaging, no matter how frivolous and fun, serves a purpose for your organization.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the best marketing campaigns of 2024?<\/h2>\n<p>As a communication nerd, I geek out over a clever, well-written, emotional ad. But as a marketer who\u2019s seen behind the promotional curtain, I always end up thinking, \u201cBut how did it perform?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The best marketing campaigns will always be the ones that motivate the most people to buy, subscribe, or donate. Based on that criteria, the campaigns on this list prove you don\u2019t need a million-dollar production budget to create the best marketing campaign of the year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need some planning inspiration?
