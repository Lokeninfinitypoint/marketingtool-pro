True, with a relatively low number of ranking signals, its algorithm is simpler than those of Google and Bing. Nonetheless, Amazon indexes information and uses an array of factors to determine who lands where in the product search results. Sounds like a search engine to me, pal.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we\u2019ll explain why keywords are important for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/30\/ecommerce-brand-bidding\">your success as an Amazon seller<\/a>. Then we\u2019ll share four Amazon keyword\u00a0tips you can use to conduct better Amazon keyword research.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s. Get. It.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>A multi-channel ecommerce strategy is an effective ecommerce strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our free guide to Google Shopping<\/a> and start spreading your brand today!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What\u2019s the deal with Amazon\u2019s search algorithm?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First of all\u2014rude. It has a name, you guys: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\">A9<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, I think I got a little too excited in the intro. Yes, it\u2019s super helpful to think of Amazon as a search engine. At the same time, though, it\u2019s crucial to remember that Amazon is an online marketplace. It\u2019s a place to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/01\/amazon-advertising-tips\">sell stuff<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon really, really wants to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/23\/selling-on-amazon\">sell stuff<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I share this obvious information because it\u2019s the driving factor behind A9. Amazon organizes the product search results in order to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">sell as much stuff as possible<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Given that, it comes as no surprise that the most <strong>relevant, high-converting products <\/strong>are the ones that win the top spots. A high-converting product, as you know, is one that actually convinces prospects to buy after they\u2019ve clicked through to the product details page.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-scarecrow-product-details-page.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-scarecrows\" width=\"1288\" height=\"399\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A spooky example of an Amazon product details page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the purposes of this blog post, we\u2019re mostly concerned with the first adjective: relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Relevant to the <em>search query<\/em>, that is. There are reasons Amazon doesn\u2019t show you nineteenth-century porcelain dolls when you search for dog food: one, dolls are vessels for demonic spirits; two, dolls have nothing to do with dog food. Nobody wants to use a search engine that populates the results with irrelevant products.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon knows this, and A9 operates accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How are Amazon keywords related to product relevance?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uh, how are s\u2019mores Pop-Tarts related to human health?<\/p>\n<p>Exactly. Amazon keywords, like s\u2019mores Pop-Tarts, are foundational. They\u2019re essential. Without <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">strong keyword practices<\/a>, the products you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/27\/top-reasons-to-sell-on-amazon-2021\">sell on Amazon <\/a>are <em>irrelevant<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>When you optimize a blog post, you optimize for a keyword. If it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/10\/holiday-shopping-statistics-2018\">a list of 2018 holiday shopping statistics<\/a>, you better make sure \u201choliday shopping statistics 2018\u201d shows up in your URL, your page title, your meta description, and the like.<\/p>\n<p>You do this to ensure that your blog post is considered relevant when somebody searches for information regarding holiday shopping statistics.<\/p>\n<p>Optimizing an Amazon product listing is no different.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Amazon keywords and your product title<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you may have already intuited, the title of your product is pretty important to its success in the Amazon search results.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, from a keyword perspective, it\u2019s probably the most important part of your listing.<\/p>\n<p>Think about your behavior as an Amazon <em>consumer<\/em> for a moment. When you search for a product, do you click on each result and carefully inspect the ins and outs of each product details page?<\/p>\n<p>If you do, please be a responsible citizen and turn yourself in to the police.<\/p>\n<p>Normal people look for shortcuts all the time. When shopping on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/16\/amazon-alternatives\">Amazon<\/a>, that means scanning product titles\u2014often only the first <em>part<\/em> of product titles\u2014in search of the one most relevant to the consumer\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-long-product-title.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-product-title-too-long\" width=\"1024\" height=\"492\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Would you read the entire title?<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Say it with me, folks: put your <strong>most important keywords<\/strong> in your product title, and put your <em>very<\/em> most important keywords at the <strong>beginning of your product title<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Brand name. Product type. Key Features. Size. Color. Quantity.<\/p>\n<p>These are what consumers scan for. Make their lives easy.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019re trying to appease the algorithm, too. Regardless of how you look at it, Amazon keywords are essential to your product titles.<\/p>\n<p>One last thing: keep screen size in mind. Your product titles are going to look different depending on the device your prospect is using to browse Amazon. This is yet another reason to put your most crucial keywords first.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Amazon keywords and your product details<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The product details page is your opportunity to outline all the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">features and benefits of your product<\/a> in a series of concise bullet points.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also the place to use the keywords you couldn\u2019t fit in the product title.<\/p>\n<p>Product details optimization is important for a couple reasons. Primarily, this is a great chance to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">nudge the prospect<\/a> closer to clicking \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Your outstanding product title brought her here, and now your highly informative bullet points will secure the conversion.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-bullet-points.png\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-product-bullets\" width=\"470\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember that product conversion rate has a huge influence on the order of Amazon search results. If you slack on your product details page, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate\">your bounce rate<\/a> will go through the roof, and you\u2019ll fall down the search results into ecommerce oblivion.<\/p>\n<p>Why does your prospect need to buy your product <em>right now<\/em>? Why shouldn\u2019t she get it from another seller? What makes your product <em>unique<\/em>? These are the questions you need to answer on the product details page.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to optimize your product details page because A9 will index your keywords and use them to inform the ordering of the search results. The logic here is no different from the logic behind your product title\u2014you\u2019re using keywords that make your product relevant to the queries prospective customers are searching.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Amazon keywords and your seller account<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of \u201chidden keywords.\u201d Maybe you\u2019ve stumbled across something called \u201csearch terms.\u201d Each is a reference to the keywords you\u2019re permitted to enter at the backend of your Amazon seller account.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-backend.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-seller-account-backend\" width=\"800\" height=\"383\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sellerlift.com\/amazon-backend-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seller Lift<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Basically, hidden keywords are your opportunity to give Amazon more information about your product\u2014information that consumers won\u2019t see. To draw a parallel to content creation, alt text allows you to give Google more information about an image to help with indexation.<\/p>\n<p>A hidden keyword is a lot like alt text\u2014but for a product rather than an image.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re selling homemade bumper stickers that advocate for Sen. Bernie Sanders. Through your keyword research, you find that a good number of Amazon users search the query \u201cbumper stickers for liberals.\u201d You\u2019ve dedicated your product title to your brand name, the materials you use, the dimensions of the stickers, and the quantity. You\u2019d like to cash in on the searches for left-leaning automobile accessories, but you don\u2019t have the space.<\/p>\n<p>So, now what?<\/p>\n<p>You enter the keyword \u201cbumper stickers for liberals\u201d into the backend of your seller account!<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/sellics.com\/blog-amazon-changes-rules-for-backend-keywords-what-it-means-for-sellers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as of August 2018<\/a>\u2014you only have 250 characters for backend keywords per product. Avoid repeating information conveyed in your product title and bullet points, as doing so will only waste this highly valuable real estate.<\/p>\n<p>To that same end: don\u2019t use commas, semicolons, or any other punctuation to separate your backend keywords. This, like repeated information, is an unnecessary waste of characters.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-backend-bad-example.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-bad-backend-practices\" width=\"978\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Unnecessary punctuation makes this an example of bad practices. Via <a href=\"https:\/\/amzdatastudio.com\/amazon-search-terms-seo-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AMZDataStudio<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By reducing the character limit to 250, Amazon has indicated that it\u2019s taking backend keywords more seriously. The company doesn\u2019t want sellers stuffing the character fields with irrelevant information and competitors\u2019 brand names. As such, if you master your backend keywords across your product catalogue, you can expect a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">considerable boost in the search rankings<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How do I conduct Amazon keyword research?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the increasingly awesome <em>Mission Impossible<\/em> film series has taught us anything, it\u2019s that going rogue pays off. If Ethan Hunt breaks protocol to save the world, it follows that you should break protocol to dominate Amazon, right?<\/p>\n<p>Wrong. Ethan Hunt is a fictional action hero and under no circumstances should you emulate him in your pursuit of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">ecommerce success<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to succeed on Amazon, you need to play by the book. And that means conducting keyword research.<\/p>\n<p>The goal? To compile a comprehensive list of keywords for each product, thus maximizing the number of search queries that trigger your product listings and making your inventory as visible as possible in the Amazon search results.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Target products that complement your product.<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you may have learned in an introductory economics course, complements are products that consumers frequently buy together.<\/p>\n<p>To put it in Amazon terms: everything you see under \u201cFrequently bought together\u201d is a complement to the product displayed on the details page.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-complements.png\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-frequently-bought-together\" width=\"690\" height=\"316\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By targeting complements to your product\u2014in the bullet points, in the product description, or in the hidden keywords\u2014you make your product visible to people who aren\u2019t <em>directly<\/em> looking for it and whose search behavior indicates that they <em>may<\/em> be interested.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, complements are intuitive. If you sell peanut butter, for example, you\u2019re well aware that your prospects are also in the market for jelly, marshmallow fluff, and bread.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, however, you\u2019ll have to do some research. Head to your competitors\u2019 product details pages and see what customers are buying in tandem. That should give you a good idea of the complements you want to target.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Type into the Amazon search bar and look at the keyword suggestions.<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you begin to enter a search query, Amazon suggests products other consumers frequently search for.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-search-suggestions.png\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-suggested-searches\" width=\"764\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is ostensibly a free Amazon keyword tool in its own right, and it&#8217;s a great tactic because it gives you a quick,<em> free<\/em> snapshot of how your prospects actually use Amazon. Yes, there are keyword research tools that give you tons of valuable, in-depth data\u2014and we\u2019ll get to those\u2014but a lot of \u2018em ain\u2019t free.<\/p>\n<p>After meticulously combing through the suggested queries (i.e., entering the type of product you sell followed by different letters of the alphabet), you\u2019ll have yourself a strong list of initial keywords to build on.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Look at what you\u2019re ranking for on Google.<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you sell on a website of your own in addition to Amazon, this one is unique to you.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers are <a href=\"https:\/\/retail.emarketer.com\/article\/more-product-searches-start-on-amazon\/5b92c0e0ebd40005bc4dc7ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more likely to begin product searches on Amazon than on Google<\/a>. To be precise, whereas 47 percent of online shoppers begin on Amazon, 35 percent begin on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Often, you\u2019ll hear this statistic with the implication that Google is the place where ecommerce businesses go to die. But, hold the phone\u2026<\/p>\n<p>35 percent! That\u2019s <em>millions<\/em> of online shoppers. <em>Millions<\/em> of online shoppers are actively looking for products\u2014including yours\u2014on Google. When you think of it that way, incorporating Google into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/21\/seo-keyword-research-ideas\">your keyword research strategy<\/a> sounds like a no-brainer. And it is.<\/p>\n<p>Use Search Console or a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMrush<\/a> to see if your website is scoring page one results for any high-volume search queries. Then, target those queries as keywords across your Amazon product listings and seller account!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-keyword-research-sem-rush-nike.png\" alt=\"amazon-keyword-research-sem-rush-example\" width=\"672\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SEMrush&#8217;s organic search position data for nike.com.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a doubly effective strategy because it allows you to build brand (or product) awareness with the prospects who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">take a little longer to convert<\/a>. Imagine this: a shopper begins on Google, lands on your website, and pokes around a bit. Then, a few days later, when he\u2019s ready to make a purchase, he sees your product in the top Amazon results. Immediately recognizing it from that awesome site he browsed earlier in the week, he clicks on your product and converts!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/11\/google-vs-amazon\">Google and Amazon<\/a> can work together to your advantage. Make it happen!<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Use a keyword research tool.<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As much as we like those homegrown strategies, it would be foolish to <em>not<\/em> incorporate some kind of keyword research tool into your approach.<\/p>\n<p>Here at WordStream, we offer a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research-tool\">rather handy keyword tool<\/a>\u2014completely free of charge.
