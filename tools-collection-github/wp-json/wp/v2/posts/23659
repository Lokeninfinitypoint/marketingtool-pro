I&#8217;ve taken some of the arguments in the comments into consideration, and upon reflection a lot of my points were unclear or misleading, and I&#8217;ve adjusted my language accordingly. Thanks to everyone for contributing to the debate. &#8211; Larry<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the most common responses to my recent \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/07\/17\/google-advertising\">War on Free Clicks<\/a>\u201d study and yesterday\u2019s article, \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/08\/why-seos-suck-at-ppc\">Why SEO\u2019s Suck at PPC<\/a>,\u201d was the notion that PPC stops the moment you stop spending, whereas SEO provides benefits forever.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of the \u201cbetter to buy than rent a home\u201d advice that was all the rage in the days leading up to the housing meltdown. Millions of homeowners got completely wiped out listening to that advice.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the SEO bubble is in a bit of a meltdown, yet SEO\u2019s are still peddling the \u201cSEO is forever\u201d dream. So is it true? Does SEO value last forever?<\/p>\n<p>It depends how you define SEO, but I think it&#8217;s more complicated than it seems.<\/p>\n<h2>What Qualifies as &#8220;Good SEO&#8221; Changes Over Time<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a screenshot of Google Analytics that I found for the Google Panda algorithm update:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"295e78c3-61b4-401d-95fd-c4b2e395493c\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/panda-update-google-analytics.png\" alt=\"Panda Update\" width=\"549\" height=\"379\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And, here\u2019s an example that I found for the Google Penguin Update:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4491d36-ad74-4dae-a54c-5f1a3fe8d6cf\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/penguin-update-google-analytics.png\" alt=\"Penguin Update\" width=\"557\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Millions of websites have been impacted by the Panda and Penguin updates. Some of these businesses were <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052702303505504577406751747002494.html\">so badly crushed<\/a> that they went out of business. Others have been advised by Google to delete their website and start a new one.<\/p>\n<p>But were the sites that were hit by these updates weren\u2019t doing \u201creal SEO\u201d? Probably not. These algorithm updates were intended to target webspam, not high-quality, legitimate sites.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I believe that <strong>it\u2019s excessively difficult for most small businesses to figure out the difference between completely <a href=\"\/white-hat-seo\">white-hat tactics<\/a> and the gray- or <a href=\"\/black-hat-seo\">black-hat<\/a> stuff that can get them fried in an algorithm update<\/strong>. Many businesses hire out and have no idea what their SEO agencies are doing to get them rankings. Others are unable to make white-hat tactics work for them.<\/p>\n<p>The difference between &#8220;good SEO&#8221; and &#8220;bad SEO&#8221; is not black and white. There are certain techniques that were considered legitimate SEO a few years ago \u2013 such as keyword-optimized anchor text and PageRank sculpting \u2013 that Google is now using as examples of &#8220;<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/22\/over-optimization-penalty\">over-optimization<\/a>.&#8221; Obviously, there are some tactics that are just flat-out spammy (like buying massive quantities of links and churning out fake spun articles), but it&#8217;s a spectrum rather than a binary.<\/p>\n<h2>SEO Requires Ongoing Maintenance<\/h2>\n<p>What happens to your SEO when you actually stop doing SEO?<\/p>\n<p>Most SEO\u2019s understand that when you do SEO, you\u2019re basically getting traffic to your site as a result of obtaining and improving search engine rankings for different keyword searches \u2013 and that this traffic comes at the expense of the sites that were previously ranking for those keywords.<\/p>\n<p>The flip side of this is that if you stop doing SEO, competitors can and will take back the traffic you acquired from them just as easily as you took it from them in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Meaning, when you stop spending on SEO, that flow of traffic begins to drop off.<\/p>\n<p>To use a real-life example, there was a period in WordStream\u2019s history when we were \u201cbetween SEOs\u201d for a few months, and during that time we were still producing content but no one was doing active link building, social media marketing, etc. Our traffic numbers started to decline, roughly at the same rate it used to be growing at, and didn\u2019t recover until we had a full-time SEO back on the case.<\/p>\n<p>To maintain and improve results over time, <em>both <\/em>SEO and PPC require ongoing time, effort, and budget.<\/p>\n<h2>SEO Costs More and More to Maintain Over Time<\/h2>\n<p>A final issue I have with the \u201cSEO lives forever\u201d claim is that it seems to imply that SEO can work as a set-it-and-forget-it kind of mode.<\/p>\n<p>An often overlooked challenge with SEO is that <strong>the more SEO you do, the more SEO you <em>have <\/em>to do just to defend your existing keyword rankings and maintain your existing SEO numbers<\/strong>. As your SEO content expands to more and more keyword and content niches, the more territory you need to defend. The costs can quickly add up.<\/p>\n<h2>But SEO Still Works For My Site!<\/h2>\n<p>You might be thinking that your website is still getting SEO traffic, and doesn\u2019t this prove that SEO lasts forever?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, we do SEO at WordStream. We spend money on it and it gets returns for us. But I try to be realistic about the costs and the challenges. We work exceptionally hard at it and we\u2019re good at it \u2013 partly because we ARE a search marketing company! Can every small business get the same results? By design, no. And we worry that companies that don\u2019t eat, sleep, and breathe Internet marketing can\u2019t keep up with the changes.<\/p>\n<p>In SEO, there are always winners and losers. For every site that gains traffic, another loses traffic. If you\u2019re one of a few websites that somehow managed to maintain or grow your SEO traffic in the last 24 months, you\u2019re probably in one of 2 camps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You haven\u2019t been caught yet by the Google SEO police. Don\u2019t get too comfortable. You could be in trouble when Google unleashes their next zoo creature upon you.<\/li>\n<li>You <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/06\/08\/matt-cutts\">truly are awesome<\/a>. SEO is part of your success, but not the whole story. Meaning, your SEO traffic is more of an effect of your awesomeness, rather than the cause of it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re lucky enough to be driving a ton of organic clicks to your site, I\u2019m happy for you. But don\u2019t be dependent on it, because SEO isn\u2019t always forever \u2013 Google giveth and Google taketh away.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>At the heart of every successful company is an effective, well thought out, proven sales and marketing process.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a consistent and repeatable way for your team to sell, you\u2019re in trouble. It&#8217;s not that your business can\u2019t succeed; it&#8217;s that you\u2019re unpredictable.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is many things, but predictable and \u201cforever\u201d it is not. We don&#8217;t depend fully on SEO and we don&#8217;t think other businesses should either; as always a healthy mix of marketing activity is the best way to ensure your lead funnel doesn&#8217;t collapse overnight.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn three reasons why the myth that SEO traffic and value lasts forever is false.
