Take inventory<\/h3>\n<p>First start broad. Sit down with your team (or yourself) and take an inventory of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your core business type?<\/li>\n<li>What are your tangible deliverables?<\/li>\n<li>What makes your deliverables different?<\/li>\n<li>What problems do your deliverables solve?<\/li>\n<li>What benefits do your deliverables provide?<\/li>\n<li>What is your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique value proposition<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>What is your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>What is your secret sauce?<\/li>\n<li>What advantages do you have over competitors?<\/li>\n<li>What are your team members\u2019 strengths and secret weapons?<\/li>\n<li>Who are your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target customers<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>What are your general audience segments or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/31\/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas\">personas<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>Do they exist in a particular location or region?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Answer the key questions freely<\/h3>\n<p>Gather together your answers to these questions and use them to answer the five key questions below:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What you do<\/li>\n<li>How you do it<\/li>\n<li>Who you do it for<\/li>\n<li>Where you do it<\/li>\n<li>What ultimate benefit\/value you achieve<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Write freely\u2014this is the creative writing part of the exercise. You&#8217;ll notice that sometimes, parts of the list are blended together or not included. There is no right or wrong mission statement.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Whittle it down<\/h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to distill each answer down into a phrase or two for each of the above elements. In the process, you&#8217;ve likely landed on words and phrases that you really like, so this part should be easy.<\/p>\n<p>Now, plug them into the formula below:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We [what you do] by [how you do it] for [target customers] to [ultimate value you provide].<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You can change the order any way you see fit.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We [provide this value] to [target customers] by [what you do] through [how you do it].<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/mktoolboxsuite.com\/mission-statement-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AnyClip&#8217;s mission statement<\/a> as an example:<\/p>\n<p><em>AnyClip\u2019s mission is to heighten viewer engagement, utilizing its metadata expertise to provide a personalized viewer experience.<\/em><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement-example-anyclip-1.png\" alt=\"anyclip's business mission statement example\" width=\"400\" height=\"199\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What they do<\/strong>: provide a personalized viewer experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How they do it: <\/strong>through metadata expertise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ultimate benefit:<\/strong> heighten viewer engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Add color<\/h3>\n<p>Avoid flowery and unnecessary adjectives and adverbs that will take away from readability, but see if the addition or substitution of any word can help add more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional<\/a> feel, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/category\/company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campaign Monitor<\/a> does with &#8220;deliver,&#8221; &#8220;complex,&#8221; and &#8220;beautifully uncomplicated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We deliver technology that solves complex problems in a beautifully uncomplicated way.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement-example-campaign-monitor-1.png\" alt=\"campaign monitor's business mission statement example\" width=\"400\" height=\"216\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Make it public<\/h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to make your mission known! Here are some of the many ways to do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a page dedicated to your mission, vision, goals, and values.<\/li>\n<li>If it&#8217;s short enough, use it as your homepage headline.<\/li>\n<li>Use it in your\u00a0Facebook or LinkedIn company page.<\/li>\n<li>Link to it in job postings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Adjust as needed<\/h3>\n<p>Change happens. New leaders come on board. Businesses rebrand or merge. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">Goals<\/a> and strategies shift. Culture evolves. So be sure to revisit your mission statement each year and make adjustments if needed.<\/p>\n<h2>Business mission statement tips<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use simple language. <\/strong>You don\u2019t want your employees or consumers consulting a dictionary when reading about your core values. Use basic structure and vocabulary that can be understood by an eighth-grade graduate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Show your unique value.<\/strong> This is the hook for your prospects. Let them know why you are the best choice out there\u2014what their business will help you to achieve, as well as what you can help them achieve.

Rework it to include an inspirational or motivational element, such as, \u201cTalk more. Share news, culture, and perspective from anywhere in the world.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Celebrate it: <\/strong>Ideally, your mission statement will become a mantra for your employees and consumers. Recognize and reward behaviors that support your mission statement to reinforce what you stand for and incorporate it into your culture.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at the bigger picture. <\/strong>The best company mission statements include the over-arching reason why the business exists and how they are bettering the world.
