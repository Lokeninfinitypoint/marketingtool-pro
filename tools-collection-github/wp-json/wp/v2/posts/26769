I asked my peers to describe paid search in a few words. Their answers included: mundane, bland, dry, a numbers game, tedious, and mind-numbing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"21d91904-7722-4cef-98ef-6db277e3da85\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-header.png\" alt=\"Emotional Ads\" width=\"726\" height=\"363\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be, though! Lots of experts love this field because actions drive results. It\u2019s quantitative. As PPC specialists, we are often focused on the numbers \u2013 impressions, bids, conversions, bounce rates. We forget to tap into the right side of our brains \u2013 our intuition, emotion, and subjectivity. We find ourselves trapped in the left side of the brain with our logic, analytics, and objection. But the surprising truth is, our PPC campaigns can be wildly improved through the use of <em>emotional ads<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happens if we take an entirely different approach to PPC and find out how emotions trigger the searcher to react?<\/strong> Are we more likely to click on an ad that is comical or one that instills shock? How about one that is emotionally driven with anger?<\/p>\n<p>We dug into the data inside hundreds of client accounts to determine the <em>four key emotions<\/em> that are especially successful in leading to clicks and conversions. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve tested ad copy that instilled each of these four emotional drivers across various sectors and industries \u2013 really running the gamut from medical practices to online clothing retailers to personal disability lawyers. My findings have been intriguing, and I was able to draw some very obvious trends from the testing.<\/p>\n<p>In this blog post, I\u2019ll show you why these four emotions \u2013 <strong>anger, disgust, affirmation, and fear<\/strong> \u2013 work so well to drive PPC results, as well as how to put them to work in ads that get crazy-high engagement, with lots of real-life examples.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get into the fun stuff, let me tell you exactly why you need emotional ads.<\/p>\n<h2>Quality Score and the Power of High Click-Through Rates<\/h2>\n<p>Google has this crazy algorithm called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>. As you\u2019ve heard, Quality Score is a secret concoction of past performance, ad copy relevance, overall account quality, landing page relevancy, keyword relevancy, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/26\/good-click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a>. But here\u2019s the hack \u2013 click-through rate is the <strong>single most powerful thing<\/strong> you can focus on when trying to improve your Quality Score.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"59af272f-7e79-4795-8ccb-0f731bc13bc8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-quality-score-1.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads Quality Score\" width=\"583\" height=\"317\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/28\/adwords-impression-share\">Impression share<\/a> goes up or down 9% for every 1 point increase or decrease in Quality Score. So basically if you don\u2019t have a good QS, your ads won\u2019t show up on the SERP much. What\u2019s the point in creating ads no one is going to see?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0570c831-9763-4460-9e71-60c6551333f1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-impression-share.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads Impression Share\" width=\"464\" height=\"310\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You also need a good Quality Score so you can get your clicks for as cheap as possible. Having a score of 10 discounts your cost per click by 50% on average. By having a lower Quality Score, you\u2019re going to be majorly overpaying for your clicks \u2013 sometimes even 400% higher than face value.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"40553880-3270-4832-84e1-89bc88002606\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png\" alt=\"how quality score impacts cost per click\" width=\"720\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads-480x357.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Lots of people think that dynamic keyword insertion produces the best ads.

Good ads lead to a higher click-through rates which earn you a higher Quality Score and thus\u2026 cheaper clicks.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Emotional Ads Perform So Well<\/h2>\n<p>Now let\u2019s talk science for a hot second. There\u2019s two main parts of the brain that drive our actions \u2013 the frontal lobe and the limbic system. The frontal lobe is pictured below in pink. This is the \u201clogical brain,\u201d and it is associated with our reasoning, planning, parts of speech, movement, and problem solving. The limbic system is the \u201cemotional brain.\u201d This is where our intuition, subjectivity, and emotions take the reins.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7c38bab9-46b5-4e12-93fc-e186b921a237\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-logic-vs-emotion-1.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads logic vs emotion\" width=\"532\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Think about any commercial that you deem entertaining. I have an obsession with pretty much any Budweiser Clydesdale or puppy commercial. Why? Because I love animals and they pull at my heart strings. They run viewers through the whole gamut of emotions from sadness to fear to happiness. Now I don\u2019t even like Budweiser (we all know Bud makes less than subpar beer), but we feel a strong affiliation with the brand because they make these awesome, emotionally charged commercials. <strong>Budweiser isn\u2019t selling the beer. They\u2019re selling what connotations you have with the beer. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just TV commercials that make use of emotions. Emotionally driven ads are prominent in all other forms of advertising \u2013 from billboards to radio and even digital marketing \u2013 like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/05\/content-marketing-for-ppc\">content marketing<\/a> and social media.

Google gives advertisers all the same old tips and best practices for ad copy creation: Include prices, offer a promotion, use a call to action\u2026 If we all do the same thing then our ads are all going to mirror one another.

The woman is having an emergency \u2013 so she\u2019s more likely to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/22\/call-tracking-industries\">take immediate action and to call<\/a> and book an appointment \u2013 rather than filling out a more passive call back form.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4eae98ad-1f14-464c-8b44-b48459fecf8a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-positive-vs-negative.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads impact of positive vs negative\" width=\"525\" height=\"294\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So for the love of paid search \u2013 go write some creative new ads (with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">emotional words, phrases<\/a>, and imagery), and I guarantee you that in a couple of months you\u2019ll see a dramatic change in your ad performance. Remember \u2013 small changes equate to small results and big changes equate to big results. Making a small change, like using dynamic keyword insertion, will give you a small increase in click through rate. Writing completely new emotional ads that make your searchers feel something will lead to big changes! Be the mad scientist and prey upon people\u2019s emotions. Don\u2019t be afraid to test big, crazy things. When you find something that works, it\u2019s like finding gold!<\/p>\n<p>Larry Kim always uses this silly analogy \u2013 \u201cBe the unicorn in a sea of donkeys.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1fc75c0a-b6ec-4a3d-a3e6-4a244750d4f0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-unicorn.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads unicorns\" width=\"546\" height=\"348\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I created a far better analogy \u2013 \u201cBe the Tom Brady in a sea of quarterbacks!\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"78b28ce9-99d4-4773-a5c1-2b9cb3cba44b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emotional-ads-patriots-meme.png\" alt=\"Emotional ads Patriots meme\" width=\"420\" height=\"278\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Sorry\u2026 I had to\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emotional ads significantly out-perform bland, boring ads, but which emotions pack the biggest punch?
