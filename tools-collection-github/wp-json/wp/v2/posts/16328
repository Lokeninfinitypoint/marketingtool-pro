This realization is coming at an exciting time, as the platforms, technologies and opportunities for consuming content are more robust than ever. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So what are the big trends driving content marketing today? Let&#8217;s explore how brands can cut through the noise and deliver their audiences value-driven content that they will engage with and share.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">1. Content Built for Voice Search <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">According to TechCrunch, <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/08\/voice-enabled-smart-speakers-to-reach-55-of-u-s-households-by-2022-says-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voice-enabled smart speakers will be in a whopping 55% of households by 2022<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Clearly, we\u2019re in the midst of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">voice search revolution<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0869cee-663e-4040-a2c4-c4ef8fc1f528\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/voice-search-statistics-2018-commerce.jpg\" alt=\"2018 voice search statistics\" width=\"600\" height=\"552\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Because of that looming penetration, creators are scrambling to figure out how to provide actual value with this burgeoning interface. Personal genomics companies such as <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hODPsllcQtA&amp;t=23s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veritas<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> have trotted out impressive demos showing the potential integration between voice and next-generation healthcare.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For Alexa, it&#8217;s the use of the <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dotcms.com\/blog\/post\/how-to-build-an-alexa-skill-that-your-audience-will-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skills<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> functionality that&#8217;s going to allow 3rd-party companies to unlock the true power of the interface. With that kind of access, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before someone unleashes a truly killer app that goes past mere voice functionality and actually gets into content marketing. It\u2019s no wonder <span lang=\"EN\">VanynerMedia&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/voicecon.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VoiceCon<\/a> in NYC explored voice-based opportunities for marketers and brands earlier this year.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">2. Automated Content Delivery<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The idea of one golden megaphone or mono-message for a brand is becoming increasingly old-fashioned. This new world of multiple audiences and use cases, targeting and retargeting capabilities, and automation services from companies like <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/marketing\/marketing-automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sharpspring<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> offers marketers the opportunity to create individual content programs for much smaller audience segments.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It also allow marketers to serve up key pieces of content at critical parts of the user journey. Meet the consumer where he or she is at, rather than firehosing a bunch of generalized content at a single newsletter list.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3842f96f-d15d-4e87-843d-5315e1f35477\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends-skittes-commercial.jpg\" alt=\"automated content marketing trend\" width=\"750\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While it will probably never get to be as ultimately targeted as what Skittles did with their Super Bowl ad for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/brand-marketing\/skittles-wants-its-super-bowl-ad-to-be-exclusive-so-its-showing-the-spot-to-just-one-teenage-fan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">single person<\/a>, we&#8217;re confident we&#8217;ll see brands exploring the happy medium between Marcos Menendez&#8217;s private commercial and a generalized billboard on I-84. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">3. Live-Streaming Everywhere<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While live-streaming was pretty novel way back when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/31\/facebook-live-guide\">Facebook Live<\/a> was opened to the public in 2016, you&#8217;ve got to do more than simply point and broadcast to stand out these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The last few bits of monoculture we have left \u2014 sports, awards shows, and event television such as Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead \u2014 have created cottage industries of instant recaps, blogs, and yes, live-streamed instant takes of the preceding episode or game. There&#8217;s no more waiting until Monday morning to find out what your favorite critics thought of last night&#8217;s season finale. Pop-culture outfits like <a href=\"https:\/\/nerdist.com\/podcasts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Nerdist <\/a>and <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"http:\/\/baldmove.com\/tag\/instant-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bald Move<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> are probably live-streaming their hot takes on this very blog post&#8230;right now! (Spoiler alert: they found this blog stylistically interesting but ultimately predictable). <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, how are brands capitalizing on these viewing trends? Like their pop-culture counterparts, brands that are successfully harnessing live-streaming are tapping into feelings of exclusivity and access. Dunkin&#8217; provided both with their company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DunkinDonutsUS\/videos\/10154465505323238\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tour video<\/a> from a while back. And Wistia has gone behind the scenes as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9fbf6d3e-310b-46ab-af68-287886c1dd5b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-company-culture-videos.jpg\" alt=\"company culture videos\" width=\"800\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to seeing more brands using live-streaming for their own content-creation efforts, look to see more deals pairing brands with individual gamers and esport teams as platforms like Twitch continue to gobble audiences&#8217; attention. Remember when your mom told you to stop wasting time with video games?

Augmented Reality<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you&#8217;ve been on the Internet you&#8217;ve heard about augmented reality, or AR. Perhaps the biggest crossover AR hit thus far was when Nintendo and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nianticlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Niantic<\/a> scored big with Pok\u00e9mon Go in 2016. But don&#8217;t take our word for it; just look at this guy: <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d63b5843-9c88-444d-bafd-18cf7ec1211f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends-augmented-reality.jpg\" alt=\"new content marketing trends augmented reality\" width=\"600\" height=\"586\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Universal Studios and Montreal&#8217;s <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ludia.com\/en\">Ludia<\/a><\/u> made another big splash recently with the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/7\/17090294\/jurassic-world-alive-pokemon-go-ar-augmented-reality-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Jurassic Park Alive<\/a> app. Ever wanted your own dinosaur, but can&#8217;t get past that &#8220;no pets&#8221; clause on the lease?

The technology has gotten to the point where emerging brands such as Bareburger have found ways to personalize the augmented experience. Nabeel Alamgir, Bareburger CMO, said &#8220;with Bareburger&#8217;s Snapchat AR campaign, we gave away 5000 burgers via our to-go bags.&#8221; To redeem, customers had to <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/social\/bareburger-using-ar-snapchat-drive-people-restaurants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">return to their local Bareburger restaurant<\/a>.

While traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/05\/podcast-advertising\">ad spends<\/a> for pre-roll and midroll ads continue to spike (anyone need a mattress), a new wave of content creation by brands has emerged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">HubSpot&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/the-growth-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Turnaround<\/a> is an engaging business documentary series that never comes close to veering into inbound marketing infotainment (seriously, it&#8217;s really good), and GE&#8217;s audio drama hit The Message performed well enough to keep the company serious about investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/digital\/thanks-to-nearly-8-million-downloads-ge-remains-bullish-on-branded-podcasts\/\">the medium<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As more brands head in this direction, we hope they can follow the lead of HubSpot and GE by committing to creating great content rather than long-form radio commercials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">7.

Although poorly done content marketing efforts can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcurrent.com\/content-marketing\/worst-marketing-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">catastrophic<\/a>, most miscalculations will end up being just kinda bad. This is an unfortunate effect of brands clumsily executing content plans, or of selling off their goodwill for quick traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whereas content creation used to feel like an underground religion with a few, strange emissaries trying to convert the uninitiated (and capture their marketing spends), content marketing has become an oft-used (and misused) buzzword. If conversations are starting off saying things like &#8220;We should make an infographic&#8221; or &#8220;we should make a video&#8221; then that could be cause for concern.
