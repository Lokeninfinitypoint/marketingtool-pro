Note that our proprietary platform dynamically shifts budget between search channels on a per-campaign basis, but in aggregate, 80-85% of budget is allotted to Google and 15-20% to Microsoft.<\/p>\n<h4>Here are the most important trends to know:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost per lead has increased significantly. <\/strong>21 of 23 industries saw an increase in cost per lead (CPL) year over year, with an average overall increase of 19%. This is significantly higher than last year\u2019s increase of 5%, in contrast to 2020\u2019s decrease of 4%, but actually similar to 2019\u2019s increase of 21%.<\/li>\n<li>The biggest increases in CPL were in Arts\/Entertainment (+134%), Travel (+69%), and Furniture (+54%); while Education\/Instruction (-29%) and Finance\/Insurance: (-2%). As we\u2019ll discuss in the key takeaways, inflation appears to be the main driver here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rate has decreased significantly. <\/strong>91% of industries saw a decrease in conversion rate, with an average overall decrease of 14%. While this is a stronger decrease than last year, it is not far off from 2019\u2019s 12% decrease.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost per click has increased only slightly. <\/strong>Just over half (57%) of the industries we looked saw an increase in CPC, with an average overall increase of 2%. This is in contrast to 2020 and 2021 which saw decreases in CPC (-4% and -1% respectively), but comparable to 2019 when there was a 6% increase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Click-through rate has remained stable. <\/strong>While 78% of the industries in our report saw an increase in CTR year over year, there was no overall average change. This is the first time since 2019 that CTR has not increased.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/search-ad-benchmarks-2019-2022-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"538\" class=\"wp-image-66597 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>With the exception of click-through rate, 2022\u2019s YoY changes are similar to those of 2019, before the pandemic.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"overview\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Key takeaways &amp; how to adapt<\/h2>\n<p>So what\u2019s behind these trends in the data? Why are small businesses seeing these impacts and what can you do about it? We believe that a combination of factors is at play, including economic factors and changes in how Google\u2019s ad platform works.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the primary causes as we see it\u2014plus recommendations on how to adapt:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Inflation is impacting conversion rates<\/h3>\n<p>Not only is the consumer price index near its highest level in 40 years, but the cost of running a business, of course, has also increased. For example, many restaurants have had to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/09\/13\/business\/grocery-prices-august#:~:text=Overall%2C%20grocery%20prices%20jumped%2013.5%25%20and%20restaurant%20menu%20prices%20increased%208%25.\">raise menu prices<\/a> to counteract rising food costs. With prices at an all-time high, consumers have become more conscious of their spending, especially for non-essential goods and services. In June, the Washington Post shared that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2022\/06\/18\/consumer-spending-slowing-economy\/\">consumers were cutting back on travel and restaurants<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inflation-news-headlines.png\" alt=\"inflation news headlines\" width=\"562\" height=\"407\" class=\"wp-image-66193 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inflation-news-headlines.png 562w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inflation-news-headlines-480x347.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 562px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>This could be bringing down conversion rates and driving up cost per lead,<\/strong> and would help explain why the industries in our study that saw the biggest increases in CPC and\/or CPL year over year were Arts\/Entertainment, Travel, Furniture, and Apparel\/Fashion\/Jewelry; and potentially also why Education\/Instruction and Finance\/Insurance were the only two industries that saw a decrease (albeit small) in CPL.<\/p>\n<p>Another factor that is likely at play with the increase in Furniture CPL is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jeffsteele\/2022\/06\/17\/supply-chain-issues-impacting-home-furnishing-staging\/?sh=7b623f7a6de6\">supply chain shortages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Inflation could also be causing more advertisers to pull back on ad spend. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-fy22-q3-earnings-youtube-earnings-down-ad-revenue-up-advertisers-pulling-back-389074\">Search Engine Land<\/a>, Google\u2019s FY22 Q3 earnings showed slow growth for ads, and leadership is attributing the declines to advertisers pulling back on spend. SEL says the slow growth \u201ccould be a warning to advertisers that further budget cuts and higher CPCs could be on the horizon.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How to adapt<\/h3>\n<p>In his article on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-during-inflation\/\">Marketing During Inflation,<\/a> Mitchell Leiman, Sr. VP of Strategy and Operations at LocaliQ, reminds us that although inflation is a top concern among small business owners, it is most likely temporary and there are ways to adapt.<\/p>\n<p>He suggests examining your costs and profit margins and finding ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-cost\">cut costs<\/a>, making use of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/09\/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas\"> free and low-cost methods of marketing<\/a>, evaluating your cash and debt, and raising prices if you need to.

Rather than striving just for bottom-funnel conversions, create campaigns for lower-friction offers to drive awareness and engagement up-funnel. You can then nurture those leads with email campaigns to build trust and\/or retarget them with lower-funnel offers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/full-funnel-strategy-offers.png\" alt=\"paid offers across the funnel\" width=\"371\" height=\"401\" class=\"wp-image-66352 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Broad match is broader than ever<\/h3>\n<p>Not only did Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">remove modified broad match keywords<\/a> last year, but since then it has also been pushing for accounts to use broad match with Smart Bidding\u2014going so far as to release a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\">limited beta test<\/a> recently that allows advertisers to remove keyword match types altogether at the campaign level.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/broad-match-targeting-beta-google-ads.png\" alt=\"broad match targeting beta update\" width=\"720\" height=\"277\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65396 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/broad-match-targeting-beta-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/broad-match-targeting-beta-google-ads-480x185.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Broader matching is leading ads to appear for more queries\u2014including those with low commercial intent. Since CTR hasn\u2019t changed overall, we can gather that people are still clicking on ads just as much, but since the intent isn\u2019t there, they\u2019re not converting.<\/p>\n<h3>How to adapt<\/h3>\n<p>In her article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">Google\u2019s push for broad match with Smart Bidding<\/a>, international paid media consultant and speaker Michelle Morgan recommends using phrase match, exact match, or dynamic search ads instead; but that if you do end up going with Google\u2019s suggested \u201cupgrade,\u201d to make sure you have enough conversion data to start with, regularly review your search queries, be conservative with budget, and set bidding restrictions to start.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/google-ads-benchmarks-2022-broad-match-smart-bidding.png\" alt=\"google ads broad match- smart bidding\" width=\"593\" height=\"319\" class=\"wp-image-66192 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/google-ads-benchmarks-2022-broad-match-smart-bidding.png 593w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/google-ads-benchmarks-2022-broad-match-smart-bidding-480x258.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 593px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Devon Anderson, VP of Media Delivery &amp; Automation at LocaliQ points out that in addition to the removal of modified broad match, \u201cWe are also seeing phrase match and broad match keywords matching more broadly in general, leading ads to show for competitor searches and irrelevant search phrases if extra precautions are not taken proactively.\u201d To keep your ads appearing for the right searches, be sure to stay on top of your keyword performance, regularly maintaining your negative keyword lists.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Search ads continue to get more competitive each year<\/h3>\n<p>This is par for the course because of the sheer efficacy of Google Ads: Given that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brafton.com\/news\/89-percent-of-consumers-use-search-engines-for-purchase-decisions\/\">89%<\/a> of buying journeys begin with a search engine, it\u2019s no wonder that PPC yields an average ROI of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/19\/digital-marketing-statistics\">$2<\/a> for every $1 spent\u2014and therefore not surprising that more and more advertisers are using the platform.<\/p>\n<p>In PPCsurvey\u2019s 2022 State of PPC report, <a href=\"https:\/\/trueclicks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/The-State-of-PPC-2022-Global-Report.pdf\">98% <\/a>of participants reported using Google Ads, versus 76% for Facebook and 64% for Instagram. The more advertisers in any given channel, the higher the competition, which leads to higher bids for fewer clicks per advertiser.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/ppc-campaign-channels-google-ads.png\" alt=\"most popular ppc channels\" width=\"522\" height=\"606\" class=\" wp-image-66343 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/ppc-campaign-channels-google-ads.png 522w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/ppc-campaign-channels-google-ads-480x557.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 522px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How to adapt<\/h3>\n<p>In order to attract the same volume of traffic and leads amid the higher competition, you may want to increase your budget\u2014not just in 2023 but during the holidays this year.
