I contributed to this post and while many experts had different perspectives on how these layoffs could impact the industry, nearly everyone agreed on one important point: This influx of talent leaving Google and Microsoft could be an opportunity and a blessing for the companies smart enough to hire these professionals reentering the job market.<\/p>\n<p>So on that note, we\u2019re sharing a different perspective in this expert round-up. We\u2019ve interviewed several recently laid-off experts in their field from Google and Microsoft and asked them to share their advice to help hiring managers find, attract, and hire talent from Google and Microsoft in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>These experts include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brendanjjacobson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brendan Jacobson<\/a>, former Senior Strategic Partner Development Manager at Google.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andreastpierre\/\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/freddy-m-6218454a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freddy Martinez<\/a>, <span>former Director of Partner Development at Microsoft.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andreastpierre\/\"><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/parimalaramdas0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parimala Ramdas<\/a>, former Senior Partner Technology Strategist at Microsoft.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andreastpierre\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrea St. Pierre<\/a>, former Head of Industry, Sales Leader at Google.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Big Tech employees come with small business benefits<\/h2>\n<p>Big Tech is known for its lengthy and strenuous interview and screening processes. They have large pools of applicants for nearly every job post. Brendan shared that \u201cGoogle hires the best and brightest and then provides them with tools for ongoing development once they are hired. Google free agents are an asset to most companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These are massive organizations with highly detailed and technical products that work with millions of other businesses and partners.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/microsoft-partners.png\" alt=\"microsoft partners\" width=\"720\" height=\"389\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70744\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/microsoft-partners.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/microsoft-partners-480x259.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Just a few of <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-au\/features\/microsoft-partners-play-critical-role-in-transforming-national-computing-fabric-with-microsofts-azure-australia-central\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft&#8217;s many partners<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is why Parimala noted that at Microsoft, &#8220;you must learn to understand the business and deliver value by connecting the dots between people, processes, and technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite the size of their corporations, many teams within Google and Microsoft are set up to act as startups within a publicly traded international conglomerate. That unique experience gives alumni of these teams the unique perspective and experience of navigating within a large company while still being agile to smaller team expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, team members from Microsoft Advertising are used to fighting long and tough battles to win against their peers at Google. Freddy shared that \u201cworking with the teams at Microsoft Advertising was always an exciting one. Every day, we were the smaller dogs looking to upset the industry. It was always an uphill battle, but winning with our partners made it worth it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How can employers find recently laid-off talent from Google?<\/h2>\n<p>Easy.
