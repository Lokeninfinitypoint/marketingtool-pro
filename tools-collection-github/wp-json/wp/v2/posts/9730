In other words, your ads will only show for queries that contain all of the words you precede with a plus sign in your keyword or phrase. However, order does not matter. Here are Google\u2019s examples of modified broad match keywords:\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/modified-broad-match-going-away-legacy-modified-broad-1.png\" alt=\"modified broad match going away legacy modified\" width=\"778\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phrase match: <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants\">Phrase matc<\/a>h keywords are similar to modified broad in that your ad will show for queries that have your target keywords (in quotations) in the search query, but order does matter. Google had already opened this match type a bit more to consider intent as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exact match: <\/strong>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/exact-match\">exact match<\/a>, you would choose a specific phrase for which you want your ad to show\u2014indicated with brackets. This is (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">as of 2018<\/a>) with the exception of functional words within a user\u2019s search query (such as \u201cin,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d), conjunctions (such as \u201cand,\u201d \u201cbut,\u201d and \u201cor\u201d), articles (such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d), misspellings, and other close variants.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Modified broad is going away\u2014what has changed?<\/h2>\n<p>Now, when you input keywords for your ads, you will only have three options: broad match, phrase match, and exact match.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modifier-going-away-screenshot-1-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away screenshot of new options\" width=\"800\" height=\"483\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So say, for example, that you are targeting\u00a0+get +more +google +ads, this input\u00a0will no longer act as a \u201ctrue\u201d broad match modifier. Rather, Google will treat the keywords as a phrase match type, but will expand to cover broad match modifier traffic as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not an ideal change,\u201d said Allison Day, WordStream\u2019s Lead Acquisition Specialist, \u201cbecause phrase match isn\u2019t an equivalent replacement for a broad match modifier in all cases. Phrase match matches keywords that have the same meaning, but in the case with our example, <em>get more Google ads<\/em> does not mean the same thing as <em>get more conversions on Google ads<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here is another visual of the new keyword match type logic will work, from <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7478529?hl=en&amp;visit_id=637484649810840478-2973469141&amp;rd=1#zippy=%2Cexact-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s support page<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modifier-going-away-new-logic-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away new logic\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>What Google says<\/h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10346549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s help article<\/a>, this change will \u201c<span lang=\"EN\">bring the best of broad match modifier into phrase match.\u201d Google states that the reasoning for this is that both phrase match and broad match modified keywords \u201coften serve the same use cases, and that you can reach more of the right customers through a combination of the two.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modified-going-away-announcement-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away announcement\" width=\"800\" height=\"209\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Google also states that this change makes it easier to manage keywords in your account (by saving you the time spent managing specific keywords) and gives you more control.<\/p>\n<p>According to Google\u2019s help article, here are some additional points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No specific action is needed. When the change takes place on February 18, performance data will not be affected and no keyword migration will be needed. In fact, it\u2019s best not to migrate or convert them at this time, since additional tools will be rolled out for easier conversion in the future.<\/li>\n<li>You can still create broad match modifier keywords until July when the new behavior is rolled out globally, but any new broad match modifier keywords will serve under the new logic. That being said, it is recommended that you create new keywords using phrase match going forward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google made further changes to broad and phrase matching behavior the following September. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/27\/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained\">Learn about those changes here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>The PPC community\u00a0weighs in<\/h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, many advertisers in the community do not agree that the removal of the modified broad match type allows for greater control. Rather, they say, it appears to be in line with the push toward <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/smart-bidding\">automated<\/a>\/Smart bidding\u2014with Google having the control.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modified-going-away-twitter-1-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away tweet reaction\" width=\"550\" height=\"133\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some advertisers, however, are more open to the change.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modifier-going-away-tweet-3-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away twitter reaction 3\" width=\"550\" height=\"154\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>The bad news&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>When we asked PPC expert <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/mark-irvine-42\">Mark Irvine<\/a> about this change, one of the initial concerns he brought to light was the growing sense of ambiguity around these changes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the fifth time that Google&#8217;s changed its keyword match type rules (2014, 2017, 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants\">2019<\/a>, and 2021), and every time, it has brought a lot of unpredictability to PPC advertisers and unearthed a lot of problems in accounts that are still following the best practices of yesteryear. What&#8217;s more interesting about this time, however, is that it&#8217;s harder to predict how advertisers will be impacted. In the past, we all knew that this meant more traffic on your keywords. This time around, that might not be the case.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Irvine also shared his thoughts on the negative impact this change could have on reach, impressions, and more for some accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAccounts that get more of their traffic from modified\u00a0broad match keywords may actually see <strong><em>a small decrease <\/em><\/strong>in their ad impressions, clicks, costs, and potentially conversions, as the new match type logic will prevent some of their keywords from matching to traffic in cases where the word order might matter. Additionally, BMM keywords that only used the + modifier on some of the words in their keyword will now require all those words to be included in a user\u2019s search, which could significantly reduce reach.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;And the good news<\/h3>\n<p>According to Irvine, some accounts may see a positive impact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn accounts that get more of their traffic from phrase match keywords, they should expect <strong><em>an increase<\/em><\/strong> in their ad impression, clicks, costs, and potentially conversions with this change. With the \u2018more broad phrase\u2019 match, these keywords will be more flexible to reach traffic that they previously hadn&#8217;t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Note here that advertisers will need to keep an eye on their budget because along with more clicks, costs could increase as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/brett-mchale-3561\">Brett McHale<\/a>,\u00a0founder of Empiric Marketing, LLC\u00a0 shared a similar mix of\u00a0positive and negative outlooks on the situation:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe change to phrase match and the phasing out of modified broad match appears to me to be another step in the automation direction for Google.\u00a0They&#8217;ve consistently blurred lines between what were once very clearly defined match types. Whether through automated bid strategies or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/03\/google-search-terms-report-changes\">limited search terms<\/a> appearing in the search terms report, it&#8217;s clear that they want you to rely on their recommendations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Brett went on: &#8220;With that being said, it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing\u2014a lot of these changes have been beneficial to the accounts that I manage, and this change will certainly make it easier for novice advertisers to understand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">keyword targeting<\/a> as it simplifies the process. As with any change that simplifies paid media, the tradeoff is that you take control and complexity away from advanced users.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In short, Brett said, &#8220;Google is doubling down on their technology and its ability to make &#8216;smart&#8217; decisions for advertisers. The change can be good for many, while it may make it harder to really fine-tune<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ad-groups\"> ad groups<\/a> for others.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How to navigate the sunsetting of modified broad match<\/h2>\n<p>Due to the aforementioned ambiguity of this change, there aren\u2019t any clear-cut instructions on how to navigate or even prepare it. This is very much a wait-and-see-situation. However, Natalie Livingston, Team Lead on Customer Success at WordStream, has some foundational tips to consider for the time being.<\/p>\n<p>Here are our five tips on what to do next.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Look at Recommendations<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now more than ever it will be important to keep an eye on Google\u2019s Recommendations specifically the add new keywords and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/31\/remove-duplicate-keywords\">remove duplicate keywords<\/a> recommendations. Due to the changes in what would be captured with a phrase match keyword, you might want to consider adding in new keywords to expand your reach. Even more importantly, because modified broad keywords and phrase match keywords are now going to pick up the same traffic, you might run into more duplicate keywords within your account. This is very important for accounts that bid on the same keywords, but use different match types. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-modifier-going-away-recommendations-1.png\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away recommendations\" width=\"800\" height=\"509\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Revisit your account structure<\/h3>\n<p>As Irvine mentioned, the changes to the modified broad and phrase match are going to affect the amount of traffic coming in and therefore your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/21\/ad-spend-pacing\">spend<\/a>. For keywords on modified broad, the traffic is going to be less than in the past and then keywords on phrase are more likely going to see more traffic come through. It will be important to keep an eye on budgets and adjust accordingly. This is particularly important for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">accounts that structure their campaigns <\/a>or ad groups by match types. An account will most likely want to allocate more budget to campaigns with more phrase match keywords than they would with modified broad. Traffic will fluctuate so it is important to keep and eye on these fluctuations and make adjustments when needed.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Continue to use negative keywords to block out bad traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Although phrase match will continue to keep intent in mind when it comes to the search traffic, it will be important to continue to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keyword<\/a>s to exclude matches you don\u2019t want. Our phrase match keywords are going to open up to more traffic than it had before so evaluating your keywords and adding negatives should be a frequent task within an account. Note: phrase match negative keywords will stay the same!<\/p>\n<h3>4. Stay up to date<\/h3>\n<p>This is a new change for all of us so we are in this together in regards to really seeing how this is going to play out in each account. It is important to continue to read what other advertisers are saying about the changes and take note of what you are seeing in your account to help share with others.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Get familiar with automated bidding<\/h3>\n<p>Google mentioned that over the last year or so, they have made improvements to other match types as well. One being the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/08\/how-to-win-google-ads-broad-match\">broad match type<\/a>. Now, broad match will look at additional signals (such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>, keywords in your ad group) within an account to deliver more relevant searches. If you are nervous about the lack of volume in your account with these new changes, you can test out broad match keywords with smart bidding to help unlock new opportunities within your account. Just be careful that your search traffic with your broad keyword isn\u2019t overlapping with search traffic in other ad groups\/campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>Prepare for the new match type logic with these tips<\/h2>\n<p>As we already mentioned, the real impact of the sunsetting of modified broad match types will be more clear once the new logic is fully rolled out. In the meantime, take a look at your match types and account structure, check out Recommendations, continue to use negative keywords, and familiarize with automated bidding if you haven\u2019t already done so.<\/p>\n<p>How do you feel about the change?
