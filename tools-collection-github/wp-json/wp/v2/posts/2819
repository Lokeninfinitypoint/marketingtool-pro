A standard set of guest posting guidelines can help with this and keep your content on brand.<\/p>\n<h3>Create awesome visuals<\/h3>\n<p>Use design tools like Canva to illustrate concepts, visualize data, and recreate charts in your branding. When other sites use your images, they\u2019ll link back to your site.

Here are some ways to turn these massive platforms into traffic generators for your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Promote your content on social<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to produce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/29\/great-content\">great content<\/a> and hope that people find it. Promote your content on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media channels<\/a> for your audience.\u00a0 Twitter is ideal for short, snappy (and tempting) links, whereas Google Business posts can help your site show up in local search results. If you\u2019re a B2C product company, you might find great traction with image-heavy social sites like Pinterest and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-competitors\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will this drive traffic to your site, but the more eyes you get on your content, the more likely you are to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">get those backlinks<\/a> we just talked about.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-website-traffic-new-post-instagram-story.png\" alt=\"how to drive website traffic - content promotion on instagram story\" width=\"720\" height=\"318\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-website-traffic-new-post-instagram-story.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-website-traffic-new-post-instagram-story-480x212.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Add hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>When sharing your content on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and other hashtag-friendly sites, include relevant hashtags to improve the reach of your posts. Keep the hashtags highly specific to the topic of the post, however, so you can get discovered by people most likely to read, share, and\/or link to your content.

And Why?<\/a> post, he makes the excellent point of creating content for potential amplifiers, and not just potential customers. Such amplifiers include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Industry publications<\/strong> like trade journals, news sites, big-brand blogs, and social influencers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>External sources of influence <\/strong>like journalists in mainstream media and social influencers outside of your field.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer evangelists:<\/strong> the people with industry followings who use and recommend you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Potential evangelists:<\/strong> customers with big networks and followings, or well-read publications<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-traffic-to-website-amplifiers.png\" alt=\"how to drive more traffic to your website - amplifiers\" width=\"720\" height=\"422\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60164\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-traffic-to-website-amplifiers.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-traffic-to-website-amplifiers-480x281.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Post native LinkedIn articles<\/h3>\n<p>The world\u2019s largest professional social network is a valuable publishing platform in its own right, which means you should be posting content to LinkedIn on a regular basis. Doing so can boost traffic to your site, drive more visitors to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/19\/linkedin-company-page-features-examples\">LinkedIn Company Page<\/a>, and increase your reputation within your industry. And you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel\u2014write a reflection piece on a recent topic or repurpose content you\u2019ve already written.<\/p>\n<h3>Interview industry thought leaders<\/h3>\n<p>Think interviews are only for the big leaguers? You\u2019d be amazed how many people will be willing to talk to you if you just ask them. Send out emails requesting an interview with thought leaders in your industry and publish the interviews on your blog. Not only will the name recognition boost your credibility and increase traffic to your website, but the interviewee will also probably share the content too, further expanding its reach.<\/p>\n<h3>Add social share buttons<\/h3>\n<p>This is an easy website traffic win. Social share buttons allow readers to share the page they\u2019re reading with their social networks in just a few clicks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-social-share-count.png\" alt=\"how to increase website traffic - social share buttons\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50805\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-social-share-count.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-social-share-count-480x304.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another option is the click-to-Tweet feature, where you offer a prewritten Tweet that readers can publish in one click. Check to see if either of these plugins are available for your site and give&#8217;m a go.<\/p>\n<h3>Research the competition<\/h3>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t used software like <a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzSumo<\/a> to check out what your competitors are up to, you\u2019re at a disadvantage. These services aggregate the social performance of specific sites and content to provide you with an at-a-glance view of what topics are resonating with readers and, most importantly, making the rounds on social media. Find out what people are reading (and talking about), and emulate that kind of content to bring traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want an even deeper look at what your competitors are doing?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Post at the right time<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get into the weeds here, you can also take a look at your social media analytics to find the times of the day and week that get the most engagement from your audience and then share your blog post links then.

Combined with an effective social promotion campaign, webinars are a great way to increase traffic to your website. Send out an email a week or so ahead of time, as well as a \u201clast chance to register\u201d reminder the day before the webinar. Make sure to archive the presentation for later viewing, and promote your webinars widely through social media. If you&#8217;re wondering how to do a webinar, click the link for some tips.<\/p>\n<h3>Start an online community<\/h3>\n<p>People want to speak their minds and weigh in on subjects they feel passionately about, so building a community on your site is a great way to start a conversation and increase traffic. Implement a robust commenting system through third-party solutions such as Facebook comments or Disqus, or create a dedicated forum where visitors can ask questions. Don\u2019t forget to manage your community to ensure that minimum standards of decorum are met, however.<\/p>\n<h3>Participate in forums<\/h3>\n<p>On the flip side, join forums and social media groups on LinkedIn, Facebook, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/drive-traffic-from-reddit\">Reddit<\/a> where you can share your knowledge. Only include links if it&#8217;s allowed and appropriate, and if you do, don&#8217;t post links only or include links in every post. And make sure the link is to a specific blog post on a relevant topic. The primary goal here is not to drive traffic to your site. It&#8217;s to add value and build brand awareness. People who are interested will search for your site on their own, or go to your profile where they can find your site.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-website-traffic-quora.png\" alt=\"how to increase website traffic - quora post\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-website-traffic-quora.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-website-traffic-quora-480x400.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Attend conferences<\/h3>\n<p>Whatever industry you\u2019re in, chances are there are at least one or two major conventions and conferences that are relevant to your business. Attending these events is a good idea \u2013 speaking at them is even better. Even a halfway decent speaking engagement is an excellent way to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry and gain significant exposure for your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Submit your content to aggregator sites<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a blog, it likely has an RSS feed which allows aggregator sites to display the latest content in a particular topic. People use these sites to follow their favorite blogs, news sites, and more, and often opt in to receive emails with these links. Most aggregators will find your feed on their own, but there are some paid aggregators to consider using. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/content-aggregators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot has a list of content aggregators here<\/a> to help you get started.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-more-traffic-to-website-rss.png\" alt=\"how to get more website traffic - aggregator email example\" width=\"720\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60182\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-more-traffic-to-website-rss.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-drive-more-traffic-to-website-rss-480x399.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Start an email newsletter<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a> does not have to be complicated.
