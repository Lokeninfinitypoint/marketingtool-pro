The challenge of auditing an account is to determine if the bidding strategies being used are helping or hurting the campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-automated-bidding-strategies.webp\" alt=\"automated bidding strategies in google ads\" width=\"664\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86032\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-automated-bidding-strategies.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-automated-bidding-strategies-480x434.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This would be far too long of a post if I went into detail on every bid strategy. I\u2019ve actually already outlined what I think are their pros and cons <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">here<\/a>. Here\u2019s what you should be thinking about when evaluating a bidding strategy in Google Ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Realistic expectations:<\/strong> The first thing I do when I look at bid strategies is to see if people have realistic ideas of what they can achieve. It\u2019s very rare that an account can hit 900% ROAS on a non-Brand Search campaign. So if I see that as a setting, I\u2019m going to be looking a little closer to see if it\u2019s actually working or if something else is afoot. Furthermore, many people will come to us with an audit request and tell us they\u2019re not getting volume for their campaigns, only to find out they have unrealistically low TCPA\u2019s set. When Google can\u2019t find success at the levels you provide, it will throttle ad service and cutback impressions until invariably it stops serving altogether. Realistic expectations not only are good for actual expectation setting about your potential performance, they also help you get the most from the smart bidding algorithms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion goal match:<\/strong> Does the bidding strategy line up with the stated goals? For example, if your main focus for a campaign is ROAS but you\u2019re using Target Impression Share bidding, you may want to evaluate that choice. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work, but if performance wanes, that bid strategy isn\u2019t designed to bring you back on track to where you want to be.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion volume:<\/strong> Unfortunately, those with more volume will always have an easier time using the machine learning associated with automated bidding. There\u2019s simply more for the platform to learn and infer. If your conversion goal isn\u2019t getting at least 30 conversions in 30 days, you may want to reevaluate and come up with a hybrid conversion strategy, shift to an action a little further up the funnel, or maybe even test a manual approach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Budget settings<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly, I check out the budget settings. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-news\">Google Ads<\/a>, you can set either a daily or lifetime budget at the campaign level, or you could group campaigns together using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rv4_j3HJ1F0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shared Budget<\/a> across all campaigns. Depending on what the account goals are, one option might be better suited than another. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for when analyzing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-spend\">Google Ads budgets<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there enough budget to support the number of campaigns that are active in the account? Should campaigns be consolidated or leverage a shared budget?<\/li>\n<li>Is there enough budget being allocated to the individual campaigns to hit the stated goals?<\/li>\n<li>Are the budget distributions across campaigns in line with performance? I.e., do the campaigns with better performance have more budget while the underperformers have less?<\/li>\n<li>Are there campaigns that are budget capped that need an increase to perform better?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-ads-campaign-structure-audit\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Review your campaign structure<\/h3>\n<p>When reviewing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/24\/ppc-account-structure\">campaign structure<\/a>, I don\u2019t look for exactly how I would have set up a campaign. I\u2019ve said for many years now that as long as a campaign setup doesn\u2019t have fundamental flaws, then the best structure is usually the one that works best for you. This was likely a bigger deal back in the day when there was a big debate between the match type segmented campaigns vs the Alpha\/Beta strategy and thematic setup, but there\u2019s still no \u201cright\u201d way to set up a campaign. Here are the things I\u2019m trying to pay attention to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How are the campaigns segmented? Brand and non-brand? Product or service? Customer type? Do these breakdowns make logical sense or is there a better way they could be organized that might work better?<\/li>\n<li>Within the campaign, are all the keywords thrown into a single ad group or are they broken down into further, logical segmentations? Are there themes within the ad groups?<\/li>\n<li>Do the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-keyword\">keywords<\/a> found in the ad group make sense based on the overall structure of the previous levels?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At this point, I\u2019m really just trying to make sure that the account is set up in such a way that it has a chance to succeed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-campaign-breakdown-by-budget.webp\" alt=\"campaign structure breakdown by budget\" width=\"866\" height=\"476\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86033\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-campaign-breakdown-by-budget.webp 866w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-campaign-breakdown-by-budget-480x264.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It might also be helpful for me to talk about some common red flags that I see for campaign structure, even though I alluded to them a little bit above:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All keywords are in a single ad group with a wide range of themes to them. This isn\u2019t necessarily a deal breaker if all the keywords are going to go to the same landing page anyway, but if 1) the keywords should be sending users to different landing pages or 2) the go to the same page and perform wildly different from each other, then this isn\u2019t an ideal setup.<\/li>\n<li>Brand and non-brand keywords in the same ad groups or campaigns. Again, not a dealbreaker, but brand and non-brand keywords tend to have a wide gap in performance so it\u2019s nearly always beneficial to have them segmented into their own campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>On the other hand, some accounts have so many ad groups broken out to support an ever-growing list of keywords that it\u2019s a little unmanageable. If I had my choice, no campaign would really have over 30 ad groups anymore, but that\u2019s a very rough rule of thumb. Don\u2019t come after me if you have more and it works. It\u2019s just that I\u2019d argue <em>most<\/em> accounts don\u2019t need any more ad groups than that in a single campaign. They could likely be segmented out further for more control with campaign-level settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Overall, the biggest thing you\u2019re looking for with campaign structure is either over or under segmentation. Either of these could cause you to not see the best performance from your account by not taking advantage of nuances in performance or trying to take so much advantage that there\u2019s not enough data to support the machine learning anymore.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f <strong>Is your Google Ads account set up for success?<\/strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-keyword-strategy-audit\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Check in on keyword strategy<\/h3>\n<p>We talked a little about keywords in the last section, but mostly their placement. Now I want to talk a bit more about the actual keyword selection and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\">match types<\/a> in use.<\/p>\n<h4>Keyword usage<\/h4>\n<p>What keywords are being used in the account? Do they actually make sense for what\u2019s being sold or offered? You\u2019d be surprised, but most often the biggest miss I see with the keywords is that it almost seems like someone was trying to get too clever and include too many things. Even things that are only tangentially related are added as keywords and they\u2019re driving queries that don\u2019t make any sense.<\/p>\n<p>The best starting place is common sense. Go look at the website for the account you\u2019re auditing. Do the keywords in the account align with the content that\u2019s on the website or not?<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re past that step, then next thing I like to do is make sure the fundamental bases are covered. Head into the <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/home\/tools\/keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyword Planner<\/a> and start with a quick search for the main terms in the account. What shows up as extended variations and are they already in the account or not? In the image above, you can see that some terms for this company are already in the account, but there are some others that we might want to try adding if they\u2019re relevant.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-account-status.webp\" alt=\"google ads keyword account status\" width=\"872\" height=\"484\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86034\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-account-status.webp 872w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-account-status-480x266.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I like to take this one step further and then add in the website to see what types of keywords Google suggests simply by the content on the site. You can choose to search for terms on a specific page or the entire website as you can see above. If the business only has a couple of offerings, it might make sense to go with the entire site, but if they have lots of different product or service categories, you may want to go one by one with each page and get a solid list of terms.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-planner.webp\" alt=\"keyword planner for google ads audit\" width=\"839\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86035\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-planner.webp 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-planner-480x212.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For keyword usage, your main goal is to make sure that the terms in the account are in line with what the business actually does. You\u2019d be surprised what you come across, especially now that Google sometimes adds keywords to accounts without people knowing, but that\u2019s a topic for a later section.<\/p>\n<h4>Match types<\/h4>\n<p>After the actual keywords, it\u2019s now time to look at the match types in use. Are they using exact, phase, and broad? Just a couple of them? Just one? Which one?<\/p>\n<p>Just like a lot of other things in this article, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to approach match types, but they do tend to have very different performance.<\/p>\n<p>Your main objective is to understand what match types are being used and to see if they\u2019re accomplishing the goals the manager is trying to hit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-match-types.webp\" alt=\"google ads keyword match types\" width=\"877\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86036\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-match-types.webp 877w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-keyword-match-types-480x293.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With exact and phrase match terms, usually folks are going to more specific terms and want to have more control over the resulting queries. Check out the Search terms report under Reports &amp; Insights. Are they hitting these queries or are other irrelevant searches sneaking in? Are there any new keywords you see in there that they should think about adding as new keywords?<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">broad match<\/a>, usually we\u2019re going for volume and reach. In my case, I typically use Broad when the other match types have worked well and I\u2019m willing to give up a little control. If they\u2019re using broad match, do you see the majority of the queries still having good relevance and only a smaller portion not aligning with the company? If that\u2019s the case and the keywords are hitting goals, they\u2019re likely in a good spot.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the two most common scenarios when I\u2019ll make a suggestion about match types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing out on volume: For accounts that leverage only exact or only exact and phrase but they\u2019re performing really well, I might <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOSrksVUclo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suggest testing some broad match<\/a> terms to see if they also perform well and can help increase volume.<\/li>\n<li>Broad getting too broad: On the other side, if an account is really only leveraging broad match and the queries aren\u2019t as relevant as I\u2019d like and performance is middling at best, I\u2019d suggest moving away from broad and leaning harder into exact and phrase until performance gets back in line with goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Negative keywords<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019d be surprised to see the number of accounts I look at that don\u2019t have a single negative keyword in them. Not one. No matter what match types you\u2019re using, you\u2019re almost always going to need some form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zsVfzVTMNTw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative keyword strategy<\/a> to keep things in line.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-negative-keyword-match.webp\" alt=\"negative keyword match\" width=\"855\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86037\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-negative-keyword-match.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-negative-keyword-match-480x254.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As the auditor, you need to make sure you know how negative keyword match types work and all the potential levels for negative keywords in the account.

Dive into ad copy strategy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">Ad copy<\/a> is the first impression you make on a potential customer, so it\u2019s a huge part of advertising success, but I know a lot of folks who really mail it in on copywriting and strategy.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad usage<\/h4>\n<p>First, I look at the number of active ads. Is it consistent across ad groups and campaigns? Are we working with just one ad per ad group or are there always three active <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/11\/responsive-search-ads-new-default-google-ads\">Responsive Search Ads<\/a> (RSAs) in place?<\/p>\n<p>While I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m also noticing the number of assets being used. Are there three headlines per ad, the full 15, somewhere in the middle? Are they always using all four descriptions or just the bare minimum.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what I find with these two checks, I might already have a significant suggestion. I personally am a fan of always having at least two RSAs active at a time, if not all three. I also like to leverage all of the headlines and descriptions I can get my hands on. Google prefers having more options to rotate through and you can be sure they\u2019ll prioritize combinations that have the better interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if you\u2019re combining this with smart bidding, they\u2019ll likely prioritize the copy that\u2019s going to achieve those goals as well, so there\u2019s not really a downside to adding more assets. Take full advantage of the space you\u2019re given.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad strategy<\/h4>\n<p>Once I\u2019m finished looking at the sheer quantity, I then shift to trying to identify what strategy, if any, is being used. I\u2019m mostly looking for three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Message testing across ad variants<\/li>\n<li>Quality of assets<\/li>\n<li>Use of pins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I want to know if there\u2019s been some effort to differentiate some messages vs. others for insights and learnings. This could look like pinning different assets into locations, using different types of assets across variants (i.e., problem-focused vs. solution-focused ads), and whether or not some form of testing structure is in place. Does one ad variant focus on price differences while another leans into the quality of the product? Do all the ads have basically the same message without any clear way to learn and improve?<\/p>\n<p>Ad copy is a tough one to gauge because copy can be pretty subjective, but if the account you\u2019re auditing doesn\u2019t seem to have any rhyme or reason to their ads, the best thing you can suggest for them is to simply develop a strategy and stick with it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-responsive-search-ads-spreadsheet.webp\" alt=\"responsive search ads audit help spreadsheet\" width=\"824\" height=\"332\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86038\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-responsive-search-ads-spreadsheet.webp 824w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-responsive-search-ads-spreadsheet-480x193.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\">wrote a post a while ago that talks about using themes for ad testing in RSAs<\/a> that could be helpful here and has worked well in all the accounts I\u2019ve tested it in. With this strategy, you can still test messaging and learn what works without hampering Google\u2019s machine learning. If nothing else, its likely worth a share with some ad examples in your audit deliverable.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad assets<\/h4>\n<p>Similar to ad copy, ad assets can be subjective to review when it comes to the actual language used, so you\u2019ll have to use your best judgment there, but the main thing I look for is coverage and consistent testing.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad asset coverage<\/h4>\n<p>Are they using all the types of ad assets that they could be? Do they have at least four sitelinks with the descriptions filled out? Are they leveraging the other easy assets that all companies should use no matter what?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business Logo<\/li>\n<li>Business Name<\/li>\n<li>Structured Snippets<\/li>\n<li>Callouts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each one of these is free ad space that can easily be tailored to any business almost without exception.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-ad-asset-coverage.webp\" alt=\"google ads ad asset coverage\" width=\"764\" height=\"229\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86039\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-ad-asset-coverage.webp 764w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-ad-asset-coverage-480x144.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 764px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What about the \u201cfancier\u201d extensions? Are they using any of those? Should they be? My best suggestion for this is simply to write a few examples, talk about how they could be used, then show what the preview would look like if they leveraged them.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad asset testing<\/h4>\n<p>Even if they have all the assets in place, does it look like they test them and rotate in new variants on a regular basis? So many accounts I audit clearly had someone who knew what they were doing set them up, but then it seems like they never checked on the assets again.<\/p>\n<p>Just like ad copy, all ad assets should be checked on regularly, likely once a month at minimum, so see which are performing well, which are lagging behind, and rotate in some new variants to find a better combination.<\/p>\n<p>Same thing as before, the best deliverable for this is a set of suggestions for each asset. Most of the time, my audit clients say they simply ran out of ideas to test. An outside pair of eyes can be really helpful to mix things up and get a new test in place.<\/p>\n<h4>Segmentations<\/h4>\n<p>A fun thing I like to look into are all of the performance segmentations you can make within the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ehanced-cpc-going-away\">Google Ads<\/a> platform to try to identify patterns.<\/p>\n<p>The first two of these I want to talk about live under the Segment breakdown. Here, you\u2019ll find the options to segment by Device and Network (with Search Partners). Both of these will show you new line items for each campaign, ad group, or keyword you\u2019re currently reviewing based on those breakdowns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-network-segmentation.webp\" alt=\"device network segmentation breakdown in google ads\" width=\"309\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86040\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-network-segmentation.webp 309w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-network-segmentation-163x300.webp 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For devices, I\u2019m usually looking to see if Mobile or Tablet are performing drastically better or worse than Desktop. If they are, I then go to investigate why that might be and make suggestions to bring one or more devices in line with the best performing group. That could be changes to ad copy, call to action, or even landing page layouts. Just depends on what I find.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-segment-breakdown.webp\" alt=\"google ads device segment breakdown\" width=\"732\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86041\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-segment-breakdown.webp 732w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-device-segment-breakdown-480x120.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 732px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With Network reviews, I\u2019m mostly looking to see if Search Partners are enabled, and if they are, how they\u2019re performing compared to Google. Unfortunately, Search Partners has a reputation for lower quality traffic, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be useful. In the image above, we have Search Partners driving nearly all the traffic for the Brand campaign and performance looks solid, so no reason to change course.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-network-segmentation.webp\" alt=\"google ads network segmentation breakdown\" width=\"686\" height=\"154\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86042\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-network-segmentation.webp 686w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-network-segmentation-480x108.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 686px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on what I find, I might ask about lead quality from Search Partners or make a suggestion to turn the network off if need be. In some cases, on the other hand, if performance looks good and your conversion actions are solid (or you\u2019re in the Ecom space where Revenue is Revenue no matter what), I might suggest turning Search Partners on to extend reach and increase campaign volume.<\/p>\n<p>The other types of segmentations I look at are for Audience, Ad Schedule, and Location. These all live under the Audiences, Keywords, and Content section in the interface.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-audiences-keywords.webp\" alt=\"other types of google ads segmentation breakdowns\" width=\"399\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-audiences-keywords.webp 399w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-audiences-keywords-202x300.webp 202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For these, I\u2019m mostly just looking for outliers. Is there anything they should take note of? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/improve-google-ads-conversions\">Ads not converting<\/a> on Sundays or racking up spend and no conversions for All Previous Site Visitors? Do people from the west coast convert at twice the rate of the rest of the country?<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the bid strategy being used, they might be able to take advantage of these insights with bid modifiers like we used to, but sometimes an insight can be meaningful enough that it warrants a change to either take advantage or avoid a loss.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-trends-audit\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Observe long-term performance trends<\/h3>\n<p>It might seem silly, but I always close out my audits with a look at long-term performance trends. As I go through all of the steps above, I\u2019m gaining context and understanding of how the account is set up and where its strengths and weaknesses lie. Once I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ll look at performance trends and see where there are outliers or trends to focus on.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s been trending upward? What\u2019s working? Are there areas of the account that are working well that are capped by budget or could use keyword expansion to get more out of them? Should we get new ad variants in place to ensure the current ones aren\u2019t getting old? Do we have all the ad assets in place to make sure we\u2019re capitalizing on the good performance?<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s not working? What campaigns have been trending downward and can we see why? Are there keywords that have been racking up spend for a long time with little to no conversions? Do we have networks, audiences, or locations that are struggling to perform in parity with the others and should we do something about them?<\/p>\n<p>Toward the end of the audit is when I can actually focus on the performance trends and have a good idea about what\u2019s causing it, good or bad. Without the account knowledge from the previous steps, I\u2019m just guessing. But at this point, I can put together not only reasons as to why something might be the way it is, but also suggestions for what to do about it, which is the real goal of an audit.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-change-history-audit\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Look into change history<\/h3>\n<p>The last thing I look at is the Change History. The biggest red flag to me is going to be something that looks like this for the last 30+ days:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-change-history.webp\" alt=\"change history in google ads\" width=\"753\" height=\"215\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86044\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-change-history.webp 753w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-ads-audit-change-history-480x137.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 753px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Not every account has enough volume to make daily, weekly, or sometimes even bi-weekly changes. But I\u2019ve yet to come across an account that didn\u2019t need something done at least once a month. That could be optimizing what\u2019s in the account already or adding something new to test. At the very least, there likely need to be new negative keywords added to make sure the ads aren\u2019t being shown for useless queries.<\/p>\n<p>If I come across an account without any changes, or far fewer changes than it should have, I usually put together a suggested cadence of reviews for them to do to keep things moving and make sure they\u2019re not wasting ad spend on crap just because they didn\u2019t want to put in a little work.<\/p>\n<h2>Make your Google Ads audit count<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a> audits can be super fun and extremely useful to the account manager. An extra pair of educated eyes can usually help identify missed opportunities or new things to test. Just like almost everything in paid media, there\u2019s a level of squishiness to this topic as I would likely give different advice on what to look for in almost every account, but hopefully this overview gives you an idea what I look for on a regular basis and a list to work with to get started.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get a clear picture of how your campaigns are performing with this step-by-step Google Ads audit tutorial.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":86047,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[101],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-85995","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-google-ads"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to Do a Google Ads Audit in 6 Super-Simple Steps | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"A Google Ads audit gives you a clear picture of how your campaigns are performing.
