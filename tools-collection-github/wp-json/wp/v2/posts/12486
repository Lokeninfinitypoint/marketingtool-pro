Although bidding on your competitors\u2019 brand names is an effective strategy in and of itself, it\u2019s just one iteration of broader marketing approach known as <strong>comparative advertising<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-pepsi-coke.jpg\" alt=\"Coke and Pepsi cans image\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Basically, comparative advertising encompasses any and all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">marketing tactics<\/a> that involve the comparison of two or more products or services. Thanks to its broad definition, comparative advertising can be executed across media: digital, print, TV, radio, outdoor, and more. As long as the value of one product or service is being communicated through its comparison to <em>another<\/em> product or service, it qualifies as comparative advertising.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got plenty of examples to share with you all. But first, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to discuss the <strong><em>why <\/em><\/strong>of comparative advertising.<\/p>\n<h2>Why comparative advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, I sort of answered this question in the introduction: Like all marketing strategies, the goal of comparative advertising is to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/21\/customer-perceived-value\">communicate the value<\/a> <\/strong>of whatever product or service you\u2019re promoting. Though it may seem as if some big name brands use comparative advertising strictly to entertain people (e.g., Wendy\u2019s repeatedly tweeting about McDonald\u2019s use of frozen patties), the true purpose of the strategy is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">communicate value<\/a>. Wendy\u2019s wants you to laugh, but they also want you to associate their food with freshness.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-wendys-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"Wendy's tweet\" width=\"800\" height=\"703\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s unique about comparative advertising is the <strong><em>way <\/em><\/strong>value gets communicated. Whereas a non-comparative ad may say something along the lines of, \u201cThis perfume will make you smell good,\u201d a comparative ad may opt for something like, \u201cThat perfume will make you smell good, but this perfume will make you smell <em>irresistible<\/em>.\u201d Now, the value of Perfume A comes not only from its quality, but also from the <em>disparity in quality<\/em> between it and Perfume B. Perfume A is valuable, in part, because it is better than Perfume B.<\/p>\n<p>Comparative advertising gives your audience an anchor\u2014something concrete, something they can use as a reference point to better understand the value of your product or service. If you\u2019ve never heard of Perfume A, being told that it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d might not mean much to you. But if you\u2019re already familiar with Perfume B, being told that it\u2019s inferior to Perfume A might make enough of an impression to get you interested. Comparative advertising allows you to capitalize on the recognizability of your competitors\u2019 brands; it allows you to turn their market share into an asset.<\/p>\n<p>One last point before I move onto the examples: There\u2019s nothing wrong with entertaining people. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/agencies\/resources\/what-consumers-want-in-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018 Clutch study<\/a>, 53% of consumers remember ads that make them laugh. Humor is an effective way to make your messaging stick, and engaging in comparative advertising gives you plenty of opportunities to get your prospects chuckling. Should writing the perfect punchline take precedence over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/06\/how-to-market-a-product\">communicating the core value of your product or service<\/a>? Of course not. But being funny and being memorable aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.<\/p>\n<p>On that note, let\u2019s look at some real-world examples of effective comparative advertising.<\/p>\n<h2>9 excellent examples of comparative advertising<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ll notice, each of the advertisers highlighted below is a big name brand with a big name brand budget. Just because you don\u2019t have the resources that <em>they <\/em>do, however, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn from what they\u2019ve done. Across these ads\u2014which, again, come from several different media\u2014the common lesson is that <strong>you can communicate value by asserting your advantage over the other businesses in your vertical<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Mac vs. PC<\/h3>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0eEG5LVXdKo?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>What better way to kick off this list than with arguably the most famous comparative advertising campaign of all-time? For those who don\u2019t know, Apple once promoted their Mac computers by running a series of TV commercials that personified the Mac and the PC in hilariously different ways\u2014the Mac being laid-back and charismatic, and the PC being dorky and overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>In one of the commercials shown above, the PC is sick with a virus\u2014something Macs are immune to. As the PC sneezes, blows his nose, and eventually passes out, the Mac\u2014portrayed by America\u2019s sweetheart Justin Long\u2014remains cool, calm, and collected. In addition to letting viewers know that Macs are impervious to viruses, the ad cleverly suggests that using a Mac is an easy way to become cooler.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Verizon vs. AT&amp;T<\/h3>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/klFbchu1nYI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Though this Verizon ad is (clearly) from the pre-smartphone era, it\u2019s still worth watching and discussing. As a Verizon customer walks through his college campus and enjoys playing online games and watching YouTube videos, an AT&amp;T customer is frustrated by his lack of access to 3G coverage (like I said: pre-smartphone). As this scenario plays out, the narrator repeats some memorable wordplay: \u201cThere\u2019s a map for that.\u201d The message? A map showing Verizon\u2019s 3G coverage is far more impressive than a map showing AT&amp;T\u2019s 3G coverage.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Allstate vs. everyone else<\/h3>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/osPQhrnzNYk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Though perhaps not as <em>overtly <\/em>comparative as Apple\u2019s Mac vs. PC campaign, Allstate\u2019s wildly successful Mayhem campaign is an example of comparative advertising nonetheless. Taking a page from the Apple playbook, Allstate uses a human actor to personify a non-human entity\u2014in this case, the non-human entity is mayhem. The overarching message of the campaign is that Allstate insurance is the smartest (most effective) choice in a world that\u2019s unpredictable.<\/p>\n<p>In this specific example, Mayhem\u2014portrayed by Dean Winters\u2014blocks a woman from seeing the pick-up truck in her blind spot. An accident ensues, and Mayhem warns the audience that having \u201ccut-rate insurance\u201d means paying for accident damage out of pocket. Therein lies the comparative element of the campaign: Mayhem is Allstate\u2019s way of comparing themselves to lower-tier competitors.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Miller Lite vs. Bud Light<\/h3>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Gl_GBZzO27c?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here, we have a TV ad run by Miller Lite in response to a controversial Bud Light campaign. In the weeks leading up to this counterattack, Bud Light made headlines with the claim that their beer is healthier than others (e.g., Miller) due to the lack of corn syrup. Bud Light\u2019s rivals did not take kindly to what they perceived as slander, of course, and Miller went so far as to parody their competitor\u2019s infamous campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The 30-second video takes place on the set of a Bud Light ad. When the director calls \u201cCut!\u201d and the actors break from character, a few members of the cast and crew head to their tent to share a couple beers. Rather than opting for Bud Light, however, everyone grabs a Miller. As they chat, the audience is shown a simple message:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-miller-lite-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Miller Lite ad\" width=\"770\" height=\"364\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Put differently: Miller Lite offers more value than Bud Light simply because it tastes better.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Wendy\u2019s vs. McDonald\u2019s<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-wendys-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Wendy's tweet\" width=\"800\" height=\"754\" \/><\/div>\n<p>We interrupt this litany of TV ads to bring you a different form of comparative advertising: a tweet. In the wake of Marvel Studios\u2019 <em>Avengers: Infinity War<\/em>, Twitter was overrun by memes related to the film\u2019s ending (spoiler alert: Thanos turns half of living creatures into dust). Known for their light-hearted and unpredictable online presence, the social team over at Wendy\u2019s couldn\u2019t help but get in on the action.<\/p>\n<p>The result? A destined-to-go-viral tweet that shows the McDonald\u2019s Big Mac turning into dust. Although that image would\u2019ve been funny (and topical) in and of itself, it was the caption that truly sent this thing over the top: \u201c[That feeling when] your beef\u2019s still frozen.\u201d For those who don\u2019t keep up with the goings on of multinational fast food restaurants\u2014probably for the best\u2014Wendy\u2019s has built their brand around the use of fresh (i.e., never frozen) beef. In this case, they chose to communicate that message by way of comparison to McDonald\u2019s.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Samsung vs. Apple<\/h3>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1ZgYlpBWfPc?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Jam-packed with hilarious digs at iPhone fanatics, this ad for the Samsung Galaxy II is my favorite example of comparative advertising. As they wait in an outrageously long line for the debut of the new iPhone\u2014this is implied, as the words \u201cApple\u201d and \u201ciPhone\u201d aren\u2019t said\u2014Apple customers are blown away to meet people on the street who are using a different kind of smartphone: a Samsung.<\/p>\n<p>As they marvel at the size of the Galaxy II screen and fantasize about the convenience of 4G speed, the Apple loyalists begin to realize that alternative devices have plenty to offer as well. To bring it all home, the 60-second video ends with a simple but powerful message: \u201cThe next big thing is already here.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>7. Dove vs. everyone else<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-dove-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Dove ad \" width=\"563\" height=\"720\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Like Allstate, Dove opted to compare themselves against a nameless amalgam of competitors rather than a specific rival. The message is simple and memorable: Whereas lesser lotions treat your skin harshly, Dove treats your skin with care. The inclusion of barbed wire, of course, is intended to drive the point home.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s something to be said about following in the footsteps of Dove and Allstate. When you go after a single specific competitor, there\u2019s a greater chance of some consumers perceiving your marketing as malicious. Being perceived in this way can have disastrous consequences, as the negative connotation forged in your prospects\u2019 heads may overpower your messaging entirely. Alternatively, going after an anonymous combination of competitors allows you to retain a good reputation while still communicating your value as a business in a memorable way.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A<\/h3>\n<p>If you <em>must <\/em>go after a specific competitor, it helps when a large proportion of their customer base is united by a common frustration. Case in point: Popeyes\u2019 recent shot at industry rival Chick-fil-A. The latter restaurant, for those who don\u2019t know, is (in)famous for being closed on Sundays. As you can imagine, many fans of the Chick-fil-A menu are disappointed when the final day of the week rolls around and they\u2019re unable to buy their favorite chicken sandwich.<\/p>\n<p>Brilliantly, the marketing team at Popeyes noticed that National Sandwich Day 2019 fell on a Sunday and quickly went to work. In the ad, a man walks up to a highway sign advertising nearby restaurants and prints the words \u201cOpen Sunday\u201d underneath the Popeyes logo. Directly to the left, of course, are the words \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d underneath the Chick-fil-A logo.<\/p>\n<p>Now <em>that <\/em>is a strong value proposition: \u201cOur biggest rival is closed, but we\u2019re still open. Come on by and enjoy a delicious chicken sandwich.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>9. BMW vs. Mercedes<\/h3>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/comparative-advertising-bmw-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"BMW tweet\" width=\"711\" height=\"747\" \/><\/div>\n<p>We\u2019ll wrap up this guide to comparative advertising with another example from Twitter. Last Halloween, BMW racked up tens of thousands of retweets and likes when they poked fun at rival auto manufacturer Mercedes-Benz. As you can see, the tweet features an image of a Mercedes-Benz sports car wearing a BMW costume. The punchline, naturally, is that the BMW is a superhero to the Mercedes. Every Mercedes wants to be a BMW in the same way that every kid in New York City wants to be Spider-Man.<\/p>\n<p>Like the folks at Wendy\u2019s, the BMW social team does a great job of keeping things light-hearted while still asserting themselves as the superior brand. You may think that a tweet like this does nothing more than make people chuckle, but remember this: 53% of consumers say they remember funny ads. If you\u2019re trying to make a strong impression, taking a page from the BMW playbook might not be such a bad idea.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Comparative advertising is a great way to communicate value quickly and effectively\u2014while also differentiating yourself from your competition.
