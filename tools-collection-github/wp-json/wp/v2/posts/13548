They tend to have a start to end date. For digital campaigns, you can run a last-minute sale advertisement and take them down when you run out of stock. You have more choices and control with digital ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You can track digital campaigns.\u00a0<\/strong>You can monitor key metrics on digital ads such as cost-per-click, site traffic, bounce rate, impressions, conversions, and even cost-per-conversion. These are just a few examples.

For example, if you wanted to change your Google ad, all you need to do is to log in and make the change, hit refresh, and it will reflect your new update.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s get into those cost-effective ad types!<\/p>\n<p>Actually, one more thing! Did you know you can view all your cost data (even from non-Google platforms) in Google Analytics? <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/11\/import-cost-data-to-google-analytics\">Learn how here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>1. Google Search Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Google has a lot of advertising streams, but the one we\u2019re talking about here looks like this.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-google-search-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Google Search Ads\" width=\"645\" height=\"616\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>These are search ads, one of the most popular forms of PPC. You only pay when a viewer clicks on the ad.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These ads appear in Google search results and will help you buy your way to the top of the search for a keyword, without any SEO strategies needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of Google Ads<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reach people with high intent.<\/strong> People searching on Google have an intention to research, understand, and potentially purchase the service or product they\u2019re finding. Advertising on Google can help you appear in front of your potential customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target a specific geographical location.<\/strong> With Google Ads, you can identify a few keywords and target within a particular area. If you\u2019re a local business, this can help you gain more customers from your community.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target many audiences with the same product.<\/strong> Most businesses sell products or services that have many audiences. Google\u2019s PPC Ads can help you reach multiple audiences with different keywords.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How much do Google search ads cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads uses an auction-based model. The auction determines whether the ad will show and, if it does, which position it ranks on the search page.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When someone conducts a search, Google finds every keyword that matches<\/li>\n<li>Google Ads will ignore searches that aren\u2019t eligible (e.g., different country or disapproved due to policy violation)<\/li>\n<li>With the remaining ads, those with a higher rank will appear. These include bid, ad quality, ad rank thresholds, the context of the search, and impact of extensions and other ad formats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Google Ads rewards businesses with high-quality ad campaigns with low click-through costs and stronger ad placements.<\/p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average cost per click (CPC) on Google Ads ranges from $1 to $2<\/a>, it depends on your location, industry, and keywords.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-adwords-average-cpc.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs AdWords average CPC by industry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1124\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Google Ads example<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-google-search-example.jpg\" alt=\"cost effective search ad example\" width=\"822\" height=\"201\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Berwick Shellfish company, a fresh seafood family business, was looking to drive direct sales through their website.

Facebook Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/05\/best-ad-platform\">best platforms to advertise on<\/a> as a small business owner. \u00a0It\u2019s the world\u2019s most popular social network, with over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/264810\/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two billion monthly active users<\/a>. Plus, each of those active users accesses the site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/social-media-marketing\/social-network-landscape-chartoftheday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight times per day<\/a> on average.<\/p>\n<p>Best of all, you can target your Facebook ads to a specific audience of your choosing.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-facebook-ads.jpg\" alt=\"cost effective Facebook ad example\" width=\"658\" height=\"956\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>While there are many different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/13\/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet\">types of <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/13\/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet\">Facebook<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/13\/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet\"> Ads<\/a>, the Mahabis example above, is a smart way to incorporate video.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We recommend exploring video on Facebook, especially since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">social video is shared 1200% more<\/a> than images and text combined.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of Facebook Ads<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reach your target audience at a low cost<\/strong>. Facebook allows small businesses to tap into their audience affordably. These ads will cost a fraction of what other online and traditional marketing channels cost. For example, when Boba Guys, a bubble tea company wanted to open up another storefront, they ran a few local awareness campaigns. They had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.closerscafe.com\/small-business-facebook-ad-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">103 <\/a>clicks on their ad at $0.20 cost per ad, $1 cost per new customer, and 9x return on ad spend.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target your exact audience<\/strong>. Facebook is one of the most targeted platforms to advertise. You can advertise to people by their location, age, education level, relationship status, interests, and behaviors. If you know who your target audience is, then reaching them won\u2019t be a problem.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advertise to website visitors<\/strong>. It takes between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2015\/04\/takes-6-8-touches-generate-viable-sales-lead-heres-why-gp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">six to eight marketing touchpoints<\/a> to create a lead. Remarketing will help you engage with past visitors, increase marketing touchpoints, and boost your chances of receiving leads and sales.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How much do Facebook Ads Cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Like Google, Facebook Ads is an auction-based model.\u00a0The average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">CPC on Facebook is $1.72<\/a>. However, this varies depending on the industry.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-cost-per-click-cpc.png\" alt=\"facebook posted massive increases in cost per click despite losses in impressions\" width=\"800\" height=\"692\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">average cost per action rate is $18.68<\/a>. Once again, this differs between different industries.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-cost-per-action-graphic.png\" alt=\"Facebook ads cost per action\" width=\"800\" height=\"752\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Facebook Ads example<\/h3>\n<p>Broccoli Pizza &amp; Pasta, a fast-growing Italian restaurant founded in 2011 in Dubai, with over 135 stores in six countries, created a high-energy Facebook three-day campaign for National Pizza Day in 2019.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-facebook-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"cost effective Facebook ads example\" width=\"326\" height=\"651\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>They reached <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/success\/broccoli-pizza-and-pasta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9.26 million people in three countries<\/a>, which resulted in a 31% boost to their sales. They also had a 2x higher return on ad spend compared to their previous campaigns by using video and immersive full-screen ads.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Amazon Sponsored Products<\/h2>\n<p>Like Google, Amazon has many advertising options. The one we\u2019re going to focus on here is Sponsored products.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsored product ads are driven by manual keywords (words users type in the search bar) and automatic keyword targeting (Amazon\u2019s systems target keywords for your campaign).<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is now the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/amazon-now-3rd-biggest-digital-ad-seller-in-us-248423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">third largest seller of ads<\/a> in the US, just behind Google and Facebook.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-amazon-sponsored-products.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon sponsored products\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So if you are selling products, it would be a no-brainer to advertise on Amazon so that you can reach over <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2018\/04\/18\/amazon-prime-members-millions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100 million Amazon Prime members<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re selling a local service, probably best to skip this option and move on to the next.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of Amazon Ads<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reach more buyers, not viewers.<\/strong> Amazon customers look to the website for products they can purchase. Amazon users have a higher intent to purchase than Facebook and Google users.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Boost the sale of your products.<\/strong> Sponsored ads allow businesses to showcase their product in front of millions of potential customers. As your product\u2019s visibility increases, so do your chances of boosting sales.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How much do Amazon Ads cost?<\/h3>\n<p>According to Rob Sieracki from Practical Commerce, the average CPC on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practicalecommerce.com\/Are-Amazon-Sponsored-Products-Ads-Worth-It\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon rarely exceeds $0.35<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This makes running ads on their platform even more cost-effective than Google Ads and equals some of the lowest cost-per-clicks on Facebook Ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon Ad example<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-amazon-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon sponsored products example\" width=\"726\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com.au\/12th-Wedding-Anniversary-Potted-Artificial\/dp\/B00JWEJJJI\/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=JustPaperRoses&amp;qid=1560325624&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com.au\/12th-Wedding-Anniversary-Potted-Artificial\/dp\/B00JWEJJJI\/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=JustPaperRoses&amp;qid=1560325624&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-8\">Just Paper Roses<\/a>, a small but growing business that created paper flowers for all occasions doubled the units sold in 30 days after joining Amazon advertising. They also increased the visibility of products, which included high-margin orchids and had higher sales that offset the ad spend.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4. LinkedIn Sponsored InMail<\/h2>\n<p>There are over <a href=\"https:\/\/about.linkedin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">610 million business professionals<\/a> on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a local business selling a service to busy professionals, other companies, or enterprises, then you need to leverage LinkedIn ads.<\/p>\n<p>While there are many types of LinkedIn Ads, we\u2019re talking about sending a Sponsored InMail.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-linkedin-sponsored-inmail.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Sponsored InMail\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/sponsored-inmail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sponsored InMail ads are different from the Google, Facebook, and Amazon ads we explored earlier. The Sponsored InMail ads allow you to enter conversations and promote content like webinars, ebooks, and other assets with key decision-makers, which are a great way to nurture a relationship, especially if it involves an expensive or ongoing purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of LinkedIn Sponsored InMail<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Send personalized messages to prospects<\/strong>. You can target audiences with relevant content through LinkedIn messenger. Furthermore, there are personalization options like what you would see in an email campaign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach engaged users<\/strong>. Only actively engaging users receive sponsored InMail messages. These ads are also only sent out once every 60 days so you can send messages to an uncluttered inbox.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How much do LinkedIn Ads cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Sponsored InMail campaigns also work as a bidding auction to reach a target audience.<\/p>\n<p>You can buy LinkedIn\u2019s Sponsored InMail messages on a cost-per-send basis (you will be paying per unit for the delivery of each Sponsored InMail.) There is a minimum total <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-can-I-find-out-the-pricing-of-Linkedin-sponsored-Inmail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign budget of $25.00<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-linkedin-sponsored-inmail-cost.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Sponsored InMail cost\" width=\"602\" height=\"289\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-can-I-find-out-the-pricing-of-Linkedin-sponsored-Inmail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Using the example above, it will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-can-I-find-out-the-pricing-of-Linkedin-sponsored-Inmail\">cost you from $780 to $900<\/a> to send 3,900 to 18,600 messages to a specific target audience in 30 days.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.altavistasp.com\/what-are-linkedin-sponsored-inmails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to AltaVista\u2019s<\/a> current Sponsored InMail campaign, their:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open rate is 44%<\/li>\n<li>Cost is around $0.75 to $0.80 per send<\/li>\n<li>Cost per open is $1.70<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>LinkedIn Ad example<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-linkedin-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Sponsored InMail example\" width=\"478\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/content\/dam\/me\/business\/en-us\/marketing-solutions\/resources\/pdfs\/linkedin-vistavu-case-study-en-us.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>VistaVu Solutions is a business management software company that targets oilfield services.

You can find them almost everywhere.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-google-display-network.jpg\" alt=\"Google Display Network Ad example\" width=\"711\" height=\"407\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/lurn.com\/blog\/use-google-display-ads-take-marketing-campaign-next-level\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Display ads function a lot like paid search ads. They have a headline, text, and URL. But they also contain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">ad design<\/a>\u2014like graphics, video, or audio\u2014that helps them jump out on the page.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of appearing on search engine results, display ads appear on websites relevant to your service or product.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Google Display or Banner Ads<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Advertise to website visitors<\/strong>. Google display ads allow you to remarket to those who have expressed a genuine interest in your business. Remarketing to website visitors can increase a visitor\u2019s engagement with the brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create ads in visual and video format<\/strong>. Unlike Google search ads, the Google Display Network allows you to use visuals, videos, and even elements of sounds, which make for more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/16\/engagement-ads\">engaging ads<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach more people<\/strong>.\u00a0The Google Display Network has <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2404191?hl=en\">over two million websites<\/a>. With Google search ads, the user needs to visit Google and search for keywords. With the Google Display Network, even those who don\u2019t use Google search can see the ads.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How much do Google Display Ads cost?<\/h3>\n<p>With Google Display Ads, you can choose to set the price you want to pay. Like Google search and Facebook Ads, Google Display Ads works via an auction approach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can choose to pay via:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost per click (CPC)<\/li>\n<li>Cost per thousand impressions (CPM)<\/li>\n<li>Cost per acquisition (CPA)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ads on the Google Display network generally have lower clickthrough rates.<\/p>\n<p>The average cost per click of an advertisement on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">Google Display Network is under $0.58<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Display ad example<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-google-display-network-example.jpg\" alt=\"Google Display Network ad example\" width=\"735\" height=\"374\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zYVEkM45M_s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Julian Bakery, a family business that produces specialty bread in La Jolla CA, used the Google Display Network.

Google Shopping Ads<\/h2>\n<p>A Google Shopping ad is a product listing that has your brand, product\u2019s image, name, and price.<\/p>\n<p>At times, they can also include reviews or other exclusive perks, like a discount or free shipping.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-effective-ad-types-google-shopping-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Google Shopping ad\" width=\"787\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>As you can see in the example, Google shopping ads appear before paid and organic search listings.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of Google Shopping Ads<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sell more with less. <\/strong>Google Shopping ads have a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.3dcart.com\/blog\/5-awesome-benefits-of-google-shopping-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">26% higher conversion rate<\/a> and a 23% lower CPC rate than search text ads.
