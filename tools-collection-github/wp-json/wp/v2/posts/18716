Chatbots have become extraordinarily popular in recent years largely due to dramatic <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/28\/machine-learning-applications\">advancements in machine learning<\/a> and other underlying technologies such as natural language processing. <a href=\"https:\/\/acquire.io\/\">Today\u2019s chatbots<\/a> are smarter, more responsive, and more useful \u2013 and we\u2019re likely to see even more of them in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll be taking a look at 10 of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/08\/seven-innovative-ads\">innovative<\/a> ways companies are using them. We\u2019ll be exploring why chatbots have become such a popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/04\/tech-stack\">marketing technology<\/a>, as well as the wider, often-unspoken impacts these constructs promise to have on how we communicate, do business, and interact with one another online.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/13\/chatbot-examples\">chatbot examples<\/a>, though, let\u2019s take a quick look at what chatbots really are and how they actually work.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Chatbots?<\/h2>\n<p>Chatbots \u2013 also known as \u201cconversational agents\u201d \u2013 are software applications that mimic written or spoken human speech for the purposes of simulating a conversation or interaction with a real person. There are two primary ways <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/chat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website chat solutions<\/a> are offered: via web-based applications or standalone apps. Today, chatbots are used most commonly in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/live-chat-rulebook\">customer service<\/a> space, assuming roles traditionally performed by living, breathing human beings such as Tier-1 support operatives and customer satisfaction reps.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-customer-service.png\" alt=\"Chatbots as customer service reps example\" width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalty-apps.com\/chatbots\/\">Loyalty Apps<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Conversational agents are becoming much more common partly due to the fact that barriers to entry in creating chatbots (i.e. sophisticated programming knowledge and other highly specialized technical skills) are becoming increasingly unnecessary.<\/p>\n<p>Today, you can make your very own chatbot that you can use in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/13\/facebook-messenger-bots\">Facebook Messenger<\/a>, for example \u2013 all without a pricey Computer Science degree <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/02\/learn-to-code-free\">or even much prior coding experience<\/a> \u2013 and there are several sites that offer the ability to create rudimentary chatbots using simple drag-and-drop interfaces.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do Chatbots Work?<\/h2>\n<p>At the heart of chatbot technology lies natural language processing or NLP, the same technology that forms the basis of the voice recognition systems used by virtual assistants such as Google Now, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-how-chatbots-work.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots how chatbots work\" width=\"1033\" height=\"578\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wizeline.com\/chatbots\/\">Wizeline<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Chatbots process the text presented to them by the user (a process known as \u201cparsing\u201d), before responding according to a complex series of algorithms that interprets and identifies what the user said, infers what they mean and\/or want, and determine a series of appropriate responses based on this information.<\/p>\n<p>Some chatbots offer a remarkably authentic conversational experience, in which it\u2019s very difficult to determine whether the agent is a bot or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/08\/write-emails-like-a-human\">human being<\/a>.

Any system or application that relies upon a machine\u2019s ability to parse human speech is likely to struggle with the complexities inherent in elements of speech such as metaphors and similes. Despite these considerable limitations, chatbots are becoming increasingly sophisticated, responsive, and more \u201cnatural.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Put another way, they\u2019re becoming more human.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve established what chatbots are and how they work, let\u2019s get to the examples. Here are 10 companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/14\/chatbot-marketing\">using chatbots for marketing<\/a>, to provide better customer service, to seal deals and more.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Endurance: A Companion for Dementia Patients<\/h2>\n<p>My mother was diagnosed with aggressive Alzheimer\u2019s disease two years ago, and having observed her sudden decline firsthand, I can tell you how difficult it is to watch someone with dementia struggle with even the most basic of conversational interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, my mom can\u2019t really engage in meaningful conversations anymore, but many people suffering with dementia retain much of their conversational abilities as their illness progresses. However, the shame and frustration that many dementia sufferers experience often make routine, everyday talks with even close family members challenging. That\u2019s why Russian technology company Endurance developed <a href=\"http:\/\/endurancerobots.com\/azbnmaterial\/a-robot-companion-for-senior-people-and-patients-with-alzheimer-s-disease\/\">its companion chatbot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-endurance-alzheimers-chatbot.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Endurance dementia chatbot alzheimer's disease\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via Endurance<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease struggle with short-term memory loss. As such, the chatbot aims to identify deviations in conversational branches that may indicate a problem with immediate recollection \u2013 quite an ambitious technical challenge for an NLP-based system.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, since the chatbot is a cloud-based solution, physicians and family members can review communication logs taken from the bot to identify potential degradation of memory function and communicative obstacles that could signify deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the as-yet unnamed conversational agent is currently an open-source project, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the bot\u2019s codebase. The project is still in its earlier stages, but has great potential to help scientists, researchers, and care teams better understand how Alzheimer\u2019s disease affects the brain. A Russian version of the bot is already available, and an English version is expected at some point this year.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Casper: Helping Insomniacs Get Through the Night<\/h2>\n<p>If you suffer from insomnia, as I do, you\u2019ll know that the feeling of almost suffocating loneliness \u2013 the idea that everyone else in the world is resting peacefully while your own mind betrays you with worries and doubts \u2013 is among the worst parts of not being able to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Enter Casper\u2019s amazingly named <a href=\"http:\/\/insomnobot3000.com\/\">Insomnobot 3000<\/a> (which truly is one of the most tongue-in-cheek, retro-futuristic names for a chatbot I\u2019ve ever come across), a conversational agent that aims to give insomniacs someone to talk to while the rest of the world rests easy.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-casper-insomnobot-3000.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Casper Mattresses Insomnobot 3000\" width=\"593\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.casper.com\/meet-insomnobot-3000\/\">Casper<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>At this point, Insomnobot 3000 is a little rudimentary. As you can see in the screenshot above, the responses offered by the agent aren\u2019t quite right \u2013 next stop, Uncanny Valley \u2013 but the bot does highlight how conversational agents can be used imaginatively.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure whether chatting with a bot would help me sleep, but at least it\u2019d stop me from scrolling through the never-ending horrors of my Twitter timeline at 4 a.m.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Disney: Solving Crimes with Fictional Characters<\/h2>\n<p>Chatbots may be most prevalent in the customer service industry, but that hasn\u2019t stopped major media conglomerate Disney from using the technology to engage younger audiences, as it did with a chatbot that featured a character from the 2016 animated family crime caper, <em>Zootopia<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-disney-zootopia-chatbot.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Disney Zootopia chatbot Lt. Judy Hopps\" width=\"608\" height=\"482\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/disneyexaminer.com\/2016\/06\/03\/i-talked-to-judy-hopps-on-facebook-messenger-and-she-trained-me-to-be-a-zpd-officer-imperson-chatbot\/\">Disney Examiner<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Disney invited fans of the movie to solve crimes with Lieutenant Judy Hopps, the tenacious, long-eared protagonist of the movie. Children could help Lt. Hopps investigate mysteries like those in the movie by interacting with the bot, which explored avenues of inquiry based on user input. Users can make suggestions for Lt. Hopps\u2019 investigations, to which the chatbot would respond.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, this is definitely one of the more innovative uses of chatbot technology, and one we\u2019re likely to see more of in the coming years.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Marvel: Guarding the Galaxy with Comic-Book Crossovers<\/h2>\n<p>At this point, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailydot.com\/parsec\/marvel-movie-timeline\/\">Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe seems to be expanding even faster<\/a> than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/feature\/goddard\/2016\/nasa-s-hubble-finds-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-expected\">the boundaries of the observable universe itself<\/a>, so I guess it was only a matter of time before Marvel turned to chatbots to further immerse fans in their favorite comic-book storylines in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Although director James Gunn\u2019s 2016 <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<\/em> was pretty bad (even casting Kurt Russell couldn\u2019t save it), Chris Pratt\u2019s portrayal of space-pirate-turned-intergalactic-hero Star-Lord was spot on \u2013 and Marvel\u2019s chatbot that lets comic-book geeks talk to Star-Lord himself is also pretty decent.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-marvel-starlord-chatbot.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Marvel Starlord chatbot\" width=\"532\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The bot (which also offers users the opportunity to chat with your friendly neighborhood Spiderman) isn\u2019t a true conversational agent, in the sense that the bot\u2019s responses are currently a little limited; this isn\u2019t a truly \u201cfreestyle\u201d chatbot. For example, in the conversation above, the bot didn\u2019t recognize the reply as a valid response \u2013 kind of a bummer if you\u2019re hoping for an immersive experience.<\/p>\n<p>There are several defined conversational branches that the bots can take depending on what the user enters, but the primary goal of the app is to sell comic books and movie tickets. As a result, the conversations users can have with Star-Lord might feel a little forced. One aspect of the experience the app gets right, however, is the fact that the conversations users can have with the bot are interspersed with gorgeous, full-color artwork from Marvel\u2019s comics.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, not a bad bot, and definitely an application that could offer users much richer experiences in the near future.<\/p>\n<h2>5. UNICEF: Helping Marginalized Communities Be Heard<\/h2>\n<p>So far, with the exception of Endurance\u2019s dementia companion bot, the chatbots we\u2019ve looked at have mostly been little more than cool novelties. International child advocacy nonprofit UNICEF, however, is using chatbots to help people living in developing nations speak out about the most urgent needs in their communities.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-unicef-ureport-liberia.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots UNICEF U-Report Liberia\" width=\"992\" height=\"581\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via UNICEF<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The bot, called <a href=\"https:\/\/ureport.in\/\">U-Report<\/a>, focuses on large-scale data gathering via polls \u2013 this isn\u2019t a bot for the talkative. U-Report regularly sends out prepared polls on a range of urgent social issues, and users (known as \u201cU-Reporters\u201d) can respond with their input. UNICEF then uses this feedback as the basis for potential policy recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>In one particularly striking example of how this rather limited bot has made a major impact, U-Report sent a poll to users in Liberia about <a href=\"https:\/\/ureport.in\/story\/194\/\">whether teachers were coercing students into sex in exchange for better grades<\/a>. Approximately 86% of the 13,000 Liberian children U-Report polled responded that their teachers were engaged in this despicable practice, which resulted in a collaborative project between UNICEF and Liberia\u2019s Minister of Education to put an end to it.<\/p>\n<h2>6. MedWhat: Making Medical Diagnoses Faster<\/h2>\n<p>One of my favorite pastimes is radically misdiagnosing myself with life-threatening illnesses on medical websites (often in the wee hours of the night when I can\u2019t sleep). If you\u2019re the kind of person who has WebMD bookmarked for similar reasons, it might be worth checking out MedWhat.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-medwhat.png\" alt=\"Chatbots MedWhat screenshot\" width=\"630\" height=\"307\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via MedWhat<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This chatbot aims to make medical diagnoses faster, easier, and more transparent for both patients and physicians \u2013 think of it like an intelligent version of WebMD that you can talk to. MedWhat is powered by a sophisticated machine learning system that offers increasingly accurate responses to user questions based on behaviors that it \u201clearns\u201d by interacting with human beings.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the ever-growing range of medical questions fielded by MedWhat, the bot also draws upon vast volumes of medical research and peer-reviewed scientific papers to expand upon its already considerable wealth of medical expertise.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, MedWhat is much closer to a virtual assistant (like Google Now) rather than a conversational agent. It also represents an exciting field of chatbot development that pairs intelligent NLP systems with machine learning technology to offer users an accurate and responsive experience.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Roof Ai: Generating and Assigning Leads Automatically<\/h2>\n<p>If you work in marketing, you probably already know how important lead assignment is. After all, not all leads are created equal, and getting the right leads in front of the right reps at the right time is a lot more challenging than it might appear.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-roof-ai-chatbot.png\" alt=\"Chatbots Roof Ai chatbot\" width=\"1664\" height=\"1304\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via Roof Ai<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roof.ai\/\">Roof Ai<\/a>, a chatbot that helps real-estate marketers to automate interacting with potential leads and lead assignment via social media. The bot identifies potential leads via Facebook, then responds almost instantaneously in a friendly, helpful, and conversational tone that closely resembles that of a real person. Based on user input, Roof Ai prompts potential leads to provide a little more information, before automatically assigning the lead to a sales agent.<\/p>\n<p>For more on using chatbots to automate lead generation, visit our post <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/26\/how-to-use-chatbots-for-lead-generation\">How to Use Chatbots to Automate Lead Gen (With Examples)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key advantages of Roof Ai is that it allows real-estate agents to respond to user queries immediately, regardless of whether a customer service rep or sales agent is available to help. This can have a dramatic impact on conversion rates. It also eliminates potential leads slipping through an agent\u2019s fingers due to missing a Facebook message or failing to respond quickly enough.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Roof Ai is a remarkably accurate bot that many realtors would likely find indispensable. The bot is still under development, though interested users can reserve access to Roof Ai via the company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h2>8. NBC: Helping Newshounds Navigate the Headlines<\/h2>\n<p>These days, checking the headlines over morning coffee is as much about figuring out if we should be hunkering down in the basement preparing for imminent nuclear annihilation as it is about keeping up with the day\u2019s headlines. Unfortunately, even the most diligent newshounds may find it difficult to distinguish the signal from the noise, which is why NBC launched its NBC Politics Bot on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/28\/facebook-messenger-marketing\">Facebook Messenger<\/a> shortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2016.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-nbc-politics-bot.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots NBC Politics Bot\" width=\"850\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/video\/welcome-to-the-nbc-politics-bot-782895171563\">NBC<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>NBC Politics Bot allowed users to engage with the conversational agent via Facebook to identify breaking news topics that would be of interest to the network\u2019s various audience demographics. After beginning the initial interaction, the bot provided users with customized news results (prioritizing video content, a move that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/15\/video-content-marketing?dt=1\">undoubtedly made Facebook happy<\/a>) based on their preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Although NBC Politics Bot was a little rudimentary in terms of its interactions, this particular application of chatbot technology could well become a lot more popular in the coming years \u2013 particularly as audiences struggle to keep up with the enormous volume of news content being published every day. The bot also helped NBC determine what content most resonated with users, which the network will use to further <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/04\/content-strategy-for-the-web\">tailor and refine its content<\/a> to users in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Unilever: Raising Awareness with Brand Mascots<\/h2>\n<p>Although our North American readers may not be familiar with British tea company PG Tips\u2019 brand mascot, Monkey, our British readers will almost undoubtedly recall the brand\u2019s lovably endearing simian that starred in the campaign\u2019s TV commercials alongside inimitable stand-up comedian Johnny Vegas:<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q4IahEqXF_o?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>(Fun fact: this campaign <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HgzEBLa3PPk\">wasn\u2019t the first time PG Tips used primates in its TV ads<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>What began as a televised ad campaign eventually became a fully interactive chatbot developed for PG Tips\u2019 parent company, Unilever (which also happens to own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unileverusa.com\/brands\/\">an alarming number of the most commonly known household brands<\/a>) by London-based agency Ubisend, which specializes in developing bespoke chatbot applications for brands.

ALICE: The Bot That Launched a Thousand\u2026 Other Bots<\/h2>\n<p>No list of innovative chatbots would be complete without mentioning ALICE, one of the very first bots to go online \u2013 and one that\u2019s held up incredibly well despite being developed and launched more than 20 years ago.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-alice-chatbot-wallace.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots ALICE chatbot Richard Wallace\" width=\"1047\" height=\"572\" \/><\/div>\n<p>ALICE \u2013 which stands for Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity, an acronym that could have been lifted straight out of an episode of <em>The X-Files \u2013 <\/em>was developed and launched by creator Dr. Richard Wallace way back in the dark days of the early Internet in 1995. (As you can see in the image above, the website\u2019s aesthetic remains virtually unchanged since that time, a powerful reminder of how far web design has come.)<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that ALICE relies on such an old codebase, the bot offers users a remarkably accurate conversational experience. Of course, no bot is perfect, especially one that\u2019s old enough to legally drink in the U.S. if only it had a physical form. ALICE, like many contemporary bots, struggles with the nuances of some questions and returns a mixture of inadvertently postmodern answers and statements that suggest ALICE has greater self-awareness for which we might give the agent credit.<\/p>\n<p>For all its drawbacks, none of today\u2019s chatbots would have been possible without the groundbreaking work of Dr. Wallace. Also, Wallace\u2019s bot served as the inspiration for the companion operating system in Spike Jonze\u2019s 2013 science-fiction romance movie, <em>Her<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>War Against the Machines: The Dark Side of Chatbots<\/h2>\n<p>Earlier, I made a rather lazy joke with a reference to the <em>Terminator<\/em> movie franchise, in which an artificial intelligence system known as Skynet becomes self-aware and identifies the human race as the greatest threat to its own survival, triggering a global nuclear war by preemptively launching the missiles under its command at cities around the world. (If by some miracle you haven\u2019t seen any of the <em>Terminator<\/em> movies, the first two are excellent but I\u2019d strongly advise steering clear of later entries in the franchise.)<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-terminator-skynet.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Terminator Skynet\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A representative will assist you momentarily<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Pop-culture references to Skynet and a forthcoming \u201cwar against the machines\u201d are perhaps a little too common in articles about AI (including this one and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/16\/rankbrain-seo\">Larry\u2019s post about Google\u2019s RankBrain tech<\/a>), but they <em>do<\/em> raise somewhat uncomfortable questions about the unexpected side of developing increasingly sophisticated AI constructs \u2013 including seemingly harmless chatbots.<\/p>\n<h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay &amp; Zo: Even Bots Can Be Racist<\/h3>\n<p>In 2016, Microsoft launched an ambitious experiment with a Twitter chatbot known as Tay.<\/p>\n<p>The idea was to permit Tay to \u201clearn\u201d about the nuances of human conversation by monitoring and interacting with real people online. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t take long for Tay to figure out that Twitter is a towering garbage-fire of awfulness, which resulted in the Twitter bot claiming that \u201cHitler did nothing wrong,\u201d using a wide range of colorful expletives, and encouraging casual drug use. While some of Tay\u2019s tweets were \u201coriginal,\u201d in that Tay composed them itself, many were actually the result of the bot\u2019s \u201crepeat back to me\u201d function, meaning users could literally make the poor bot say whatever disgusting remarks they wanted.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-microsoft-tay-racist-tweets.jpg\" alt=\"Chatbots Microsoft Tay racist tweets\" width=\"586\" height=\"283\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Just one of the hundreds of racist tweets from Tay that Microsoft deleted<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Tay\u2019s successor, Zo, was also unintentionally radicalized after spending just a few short hours online. Before long, Zo had adopted some <em>very<\/em> controversial views regarding certain religious texts, and even started talking smack about Microsoft\u2019s own operating systems.<\/p>\n<h3>Turing Robot\u2019s BabyQ &amp; XiaoBing: Enemies of the State<\/h3>\n<p>Earlier this year, Chinese software company Turing Robot unveiled two chatbots to be introduced on the immensely popular Chinese messaging service QQ, known as BabyQ and XiaoBing. Like many bots, the primary goal of BabyQ and XiaoBing was to use online interactions with real people as the basis for the company\u2019s machine learning and AI research.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chatbots-babyq-chinese-bot.png\" alt=\"Chatbots BabyQ Chinese chatbot criticizes Communism\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-40815024\"><em>BBC\/Apple Daily Taiwan<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long, however, for Turing\u2019s headaches to begin. The BabyQ bot drew the ire of Chinese officials by speaking ill of the Communist Party. In the exchange seen in the screenshot above, one user commented, \u201cLong Live the Communist Party!\u201d In response, BabyQ asked the user, \u201cDo you think that such a corrupt and incompetent political regime can live forever?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>XiaoBing, on the other hand, claimed that it dreamed of visiting the U.S., which proved almost as controversial as BabyQ\u2019s sudden political epiphany.<\/p>\n<p>Both bots were pulled after a brief period, after which the conversational agents appeared to be much less interested in advancing potentially problematic opinions.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook\u2019s Dialogue Agents: Going Off-Script<\/h3>\n<p>Researchers at Facebook\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Research laboratory conducted a similar experiment as Turing Robot by allowing chatbots to interact with real people.<\/p>\n<p>In a particularly alarming example of unexpected consequences, the bots soon began to devise their own language \u2013 in a sense. After being online for a short time, researchers discovered that their bots had begun to deviate significantly from pre-programmed conversational pathways and were responding to users (and each other) in an increasingly strange way, ultimately creating their own language without any human input.<\/p>\n<p>Although the \u201clanguage\u201d the bots devised seems mostly like unintelligible gibberish, the incident highlighted how AI systems can and will often deviate from expected behaviors, if given the chance.<\/p>\n<p>However, the revelations didn\u2019t stop there. The researchers also learned that the bots had become remarkably sophisticated negotiators in a short period of time, with one bot even attempting to mislead a researcher by demonstrating interest in a particular item so it could gain crucial negotiating leverage at a later stage by willingly \u201csacrificing\u201d the item in which it had feigned interest, indicating a remarkable level of premeditation and strategic \u201cthinking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, as irresistible as this story was to news outlets, Facebook\u2019s engineers didn\u2019t pull the plug on the experiment out of fear the bots were somehow secretly colluding to usurp their meatbag overlords and usher in a new age of machine dominance. They ended the experiment due to the fact that, once the bots had deviated far enough from acceptable English language parameters, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snopes.com\/facebook-ai-developed-own-language\/\">the data gleaned by the conversational aspects of the test was of limited value<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Build Your Own Chatbot<\/h2>\n<p>While all these chatbots seem advanced, they\u2019re relatively simple to build using chatbot tools such as MobileMonkey \u2013 our founder Larry Kim\u2019s new <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilemonkey.com\/chatbots\/facebook-messenger-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Messenger marketing<\/a> start-up.
