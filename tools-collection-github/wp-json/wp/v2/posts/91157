Even if they see an out-of-home advertisement or pass by a brick-and-mortar, they\u2019ll often look up the business online to check out the pricing, offerings, and the company\u2019s online presence. (Guilty.)<\/p>\n<p>Facebook reviews, in particular, matter because they will influence your potential customers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/chart\/266242\/where-us-consumers-start-their-search-online-shopping-feb-2024-of-respondents\">10%<\/a> of shoppers start their search for a product on Facebook.

You need at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/500762053364226\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five reviews<\/a> to get a rating for your page, but this is a minimum. You want to amass enough reviews that they reflect all of your different customer types and reference all of your core products and offerings.<\/p>\n<p>The most effective way to get more reviews is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">ask for them<\/a>. Here\u2019s how to do that.<\/p>\n<h3>Send follow-up emails after a purchase or service<\/h3>\n<p>You probably already have automations set up for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/07\/thank-you-for-your-order-messages\">thank you emails<\/a> post-purchase and shipping updates, if those are relevant. One effective, straightforward strategy to get more Facebook reviews is to add an automated check-in email.<\/p>\n<p>This should arrive a week or two after a completed order to see how your customers are enjoying their purchase. Did everything arrive in good condition? Were the services satisfactory? Do they have any immediate feedback? And, most importantly, if they\u2019re happy with the purchase and results, would they be interested in leaving a review?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-email-example-png.webp\" alt=\"review request email example\" width=\"528\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91180\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-email-example-png.webp 528w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-email-example-480x818.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 528px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Two things to be aware of with these emails. First, make it easy to submit a review. Include a button (like the email example above) linking directly to your Facebook review page.<\/p>\n<p>And second, be sure to actually respond to any feedback\u2014positive and especially negative. You don\u2019t want to ignore an unhappy customer who is willing to reach out.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udceb <strong>Get everything you need for great emails (even review request emails!) &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/email-examples-and-templates?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">The Complete Email Marketing Toolkit: Free Email Templates, Subject Lines &amp; Tips<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Request reviews in your receipts or invoices<\/h3>\n<p>For plenty of giant corporations, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/qr-code-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QR code<\/a> leading to a review site on a physical receipt or a link to submit review in an emailed receipt is common practice. This is something that your business\u2014small or medium, ecommerce or in-person services\u2014can do, too.<\/p>\n<h3>Ask customers directly<\/h3>\n<p>If you do business in person, make sure to ask your customers directly for a review. If you have a services business, add this to your final goodbye when a happy client thanks you for a job well done. If you have a brick-and-mortar store, include the prompt to leave a Facebook review in your regular checkout script. Or save the request for your enthusiasts and return customers.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s good to keep in mind that customers won\u2019t be thrown by this request. BrightLocal found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey-2024\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28%<\/a> of customers reported they&#8217;d prefer to be asked to leave reviews in person (second only to email requests).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-png.webp\" alt=\"how customers want to be asked to leave reviews from brightlocal survey\" width=\"831\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91189\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-png.webp 831w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-480x520.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 831px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Post on your Facebook page with a clear CTA<\/h3>\n<p>Another option is to ask your customers to leave a review when they\u2019re already on Facebook.

While they\u2019re scrolling past updates and ads, or if they\u2019re checking your business page for hours or sales, they\u2019ll see your post\u2014and best case scenario, they\u2019ll leave a review.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember, you don\u2019t want to do this too often. Asking for reviews is great. Looking like you\u2019re begging or bugging your followers?

Most <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing email templates<\/a> put these in a footer so that they appear in every single email sent to ensure compliance. But you don\u2019t have to stop there.<\/p>\n<p>You can also include a subtle request for reviews in your email footer. Depending on your template or your company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing strategy<\/a>, you could also include this request to leave a review on Facebook in your employee email signatures.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-in-email-signature-png.webp\" alt=\"example of review request in email signature\" width=\"607\" height=\"403\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91181\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-in-email-signature-png.webp 607w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/review-request-in-email-signature-480x319.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Text your subscribed customers about review promotions<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/sms-marketing-examples\">SMS marketing<\/a> is another good channel to reach your customers with a simple, direct request for a review, especially after a recent transaction. Simple Texting found that <a href=\"https:\/\/simpletexting.com\/blog\/2024-texting-and-sms-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">79%<\/a> of consumers opted into receiving text messages from businesses in 2024.

I\u2019ve submitted my phone number in exchange for a 15% off discount\u2026 and proceeded to stay subscribed and click on the sales offers too many times.<\/p>\n<p>But as long as you\u2019re using SMS marketing sparingly and purposefully, adding a prompt to leave a Facebook review after purchase is a great way to get more reviews.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage a chatbot script<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re using a chatbot on your website, you can create a script with a prompt to leave a Facebook review to target relevant conversations with customers. In fact, some businesses have seen great success using this tactic.<\/p>\n<p>Andrey Lipkovskiy shared the breakdown of a chatbot experiment they ran to generate more Facebook reviews <a href=\"https:\/\/manychat.com\/blog\/generate-customer-reviews-with-chatbots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manychat blog<\/a>. The results were overwhelming. An 87% open rate, a 24% CTA, and 65 new 5-star reviews in just 24 hours. Worth a try.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-png.webp\" alt=\"reviews standing for manychat on facebook\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91177\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-png.webp 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-480x346.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via Manychat<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Use positive reviews in your marketing materials<\/h3>\n<p>Another subtle way to call attention to your Facebook reviews is to use those customer testimonials in your marketing materials. You can feature these in display ads, Instagram or Facebook ads, Google Ads\u2014there are tons of options. And the good news is that these are effective for sales, as well. One case study found that using testimonials on sales pages, for instance, increased purchases by <a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/success-stories\/wikijob\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">34%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/reviews-in-facebook-ad-png.webp\" alt=\"star rating showing in facebook ad\" width=\"509\" height=\"495\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91179\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/reviews-in-facebook-ad-png.webp 509w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/reviews-in-facebook-ad-480x467.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 509px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Avoid offering a discount or running a giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Technically, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/business-guidance\/resources\/soliciting-paying-online-reviews-guide-marketers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commission<\/a> allows you to incentivize reviews as long as you incentivize positive and negative reviews equally and the compensation is disclosed in the body of the review. But many platforms, including Etsy and Google, prohibit this because it makes reviews less trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook doesn\u2019t explicitly prohibit compensation for reviews, but it\u2019s still better to avoid. Especially because it undermines the authority in all of your other reviews, even ones you earned from happy, uncompensated customers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-manage-facebook-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to manage your Facebook reviews<\/h2>\n<p>Getting more Facebook reviews is important, but so is following through on managing those reviews. You need to be paying attention to your page, responding in a timely manner, and keeping track of your overall business score to ensure that these Facebook reviews remain a tool to help grow your business.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h3>Make sure your reviews are enabled and visible<\/h3>\n<p>This is the first step because it\u2019s the most basic. <strong>In order to get Facebook reviews on your business page, you need to enable reviews in your profile. <\/strong>Luckily, it\u2019s easy to do.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, go to your page.<\/li>\n<li>Next, click on settings.<\/li>\n<li>When the new window appears, click on the \u201cTemplates and Tabs\u201d section.<\/li>\n<li>Toggle reviews \u201cOn.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And that\u2019s it. Simple, but essential. You can also change the order so that the tab containing reviews appears early.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-png.webp\" alt=\"facebook business page reviews tab\" width=\"1200\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-980x558.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Have your Facebook review link handy<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re asking people to leave a review, you need to direct them to the correct place. So make sure you have a link directly to your review page stored in a readily accessible location. Whether it\u2019s in your email signature, in a shared note or document with all your review and social links, or in your company\u2019s project and document database is up to you and depends on what works best for your team and your business. The important thing is that it\u2019s easy to access.<\/p>\n<p>And make sure other members of your team have easy access, too, and know where to find the link. You never know when someone might want to ask for a Facebook review.<\/p>\n<h3>Set up automated notifications for new reviews<\/h3>\n<p>To manage your Facebook reviews, you need to know when you have a new one. Checking regularly is good practice, but to save yourself time, you can set up automatic notifications for any new review.<\/p>\n<p>On your Facebook business page, go to the \u201cNotifications\u201d tab and make sure you\u2019ve got the \u201cNew Reviews\u201d options selected.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-png.webp\" alt=\"5-star review for a moving service on facebook\" width=\"451\" height=\"272\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91178\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-png.webp 451w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-300x181.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You want to be able to respond to a glowing review like this ASAP.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Respond to all reviews<\/h3>\n<p>You need to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respond to all of your reviews<\/a>. This is not only a good practice, it\u2019s also important for ensuring a good Facebook business rating (more on this later) and boosting your brand\u2019s trustworthiness. Studies show that businesses that respond to customer reviews are perceived as <a href=\"https:\/\/grow.google\/intl\/en_my\/article-how-to-respond-to-reviews-on-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.7 times<\/a> more trustworthy than brands who don\u2019t respond.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that your responses should be individualized when it\u2019s called for, too. This is true for an exceptional and personal review as well as your negative reviews. When a frustrated customer reaches out, you should validate and accept their feedback, apologize for the poor experience, and provide a venue for follow-up communication to resolve the issue. And this brings us to our next step.<\/p>\n<h3>Follow up with action on negative reviews<\/h3>\n<p>When you have <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative reviews<\/a> that are specifically about a poor experience or a disappointing purchase, you need to follow up with an action. This should first be a follow-up communication off of your Facebook page, either a direct email or a phone call. And if possible, you should offer a solution to rectify the situation, like a replacement item, a discount, or a correction in your services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-png.webp\" alt=\"example of a negative facebook review with a response\" width=\"1066\" height=\"601\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91188\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-png.webp 1066w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-980x553.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-480x271.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1066px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A good prompt response that validates and promises a follow-up action.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Flag inappropriate or fake content right away<\/h3>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s be clear. You can\u2019t curate your Facebook reviews (and you can\u2019t delete them just because you don\u2019t like them). Negative reviews will stay there (and that\u2019s not always bad), and lukewarm recommendations will be visible, too. But if there is content that is inappropriate, it\u2019s your responsibility to report it. If it\u2019s a fake review, you want to report it.<\/p>\n<p>You can do so easily by clicking the three dots (&#8230;) next to the review, selecting \u201c\u200b\u200bFind Support or Report Review,\u201d and then following the prompts.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this won\u2019t delete the content automatically, but it is the first step in removing it from your page.<\/p>\n<h3>Monitor your Facebook business score<\/h3>\n<p>Before 2018, all Facebook reviews included star ratings. In 2018, the platform changed the format of reviews to a simple question: \u201cDo you recommend the business or not?\u201d Then, respondents have the opportunity to include a narrative review.<\/p>\n<p>Once your page has five or more Facebook reviews, the platform will assign your business a rating. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/579645403238373\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta<\/a>, this rating reflects an average of your customers\u2019 satisfaction with your business and your products or services.
