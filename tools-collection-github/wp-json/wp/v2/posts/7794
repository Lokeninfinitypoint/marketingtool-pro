Destination not\u00a0working<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Your site can\u2019t be reached by Google\u2019s\u00a0crawlers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-destination-not-working-1.png\" alt=\"screen shot of &quot;destination not working&quot; google ad disapproval\" width=\"476\" height=\"188\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>This is probably the most common disapproval and there could be a few reasons why your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>\u00a0is deemed \u201cnot working\u201d\u00a0by Google.\u00a0Sometimes this requires adjusting your\u00a0site code to accommodate crawlers with a \u201crobots.txt\u201d add-on. On the opposite end, it could be as simple as\u00a0a mistake in your ad\u2019s final URL that you just need to tweak.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you\u2019ll want to ensure\u00a0your site is universally accessible, even if you\u2019re only advertising to a specific area. If you\u2019re unsure\u00a0about\u00a0the root\u00a0of your \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6368661?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">destination not working<\/a>\u201d\u00a0disapproval,\u00a0I&#8217;ll cover some tips\u00a0later on\u00a0how to get\u00a0further clarification from Google.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader\"><em><strong>Speaking of mistakes, use our Free Google Ads Performance Grader to make sure you&#8217;re not making them with your budget!<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2.

Identify which final URL all the ads should be pointing to, and\u00a0ensure every ad (yup, even the paused ones) in that ad group go to that same final URL path.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to have multiple ads that go to different places, then you can absolutely do that. However, they will need to be in\u00a0different ad groups (or campaigns).<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, campaigns can\u2019t have\u00a0final URLs leading to two different\u00a0domains. In short, campaigns can have different final URLs within them, but ad groups can\u2019t.\u00a0Accounts can have ads pointing to more than one domain, but campaigns can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0Capitalization<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>Either your ad or ad extension has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6021546?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incorrect capitalization<\/a>\u00a0via excessive or \u201cgimmicky\u201d use.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-capitalization-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot of google ads capitalization disapproval\" width=\"332\" height=\"236\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>While it\u2019s still a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/expanded-text-ad-best-practices\">best practice<\/a> to capitalize the first letter in each word of your ad copy, you want to avoid using all uppercase\u2014even for emphasis.

Punctuation and symbols<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>This is that picky grammar portion of Google Ads where it requires advertisers to have ad text that\u2019s grammatically correct and avoids any excessive symbols.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-punctuation-symbols-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of google ads punctuation and symbols disapproval\" width=\"410\" height=\"228\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>Just like any public content platform, Google Ads has\u00a0its\u00a0own\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6021546?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stylistic guidelines<\/a>\u00a0that\u00a0all text in ads should adhere to.

You\u2019ll\u00a0have\u00a0to rely on the context of your ad to get your point across to the\u00a0reader, and\u00a0correct the punctuation in your ad copy to avoid this issue.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Malicious software<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Google\u2019s crawlers identified suspicious activity on your\u00a0website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-malicious-software-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of malicious software google ad disapproval\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adhocmarketing.com\/blog\/10-reasons-why-your-google-ad-was-rejected-in-2020-should-you-be-worried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0We\u2019ll admit this one can be tougher.\u00a0It usually has to do with your website\u2019s coding or links. It can feel like searching through a needle in the haystack, so you\u2019ll most likely want to contact Google for this one to get clarification on, at minimum, a specific location within the site of where the issue is\u00a0occurring.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, we suggest having your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">webmaster<\/a> check your site code for any suspicious activity.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Sensitive events<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>Your ad copy or landing page content\u00a0is\u00a0looking to profit from or exploit an impactful\u00a0social, cultural, or political\u00a0event.\u00a0Examples of this could be discussing\u00a0a public health crisis, civil emergencies, natural disasters,\u00a0conflicts, or victims\u00a0of those involved with such\u00a0events.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-sensitive-events-1.png\" alt=\"google ads disapproval for sensitive events \" width=\"520\" height=\"228\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>The tough part is, what might not seem sensitive to you may be sensitive to others. For example, senior living accounts that offer\u00a0Alzheimer&#8217;s disease\u00a0care may not want to\u00a0mention\u00a0the victims of the disease, as that could be viewed as leveraging the\u00a0victim factor\u00a0to\u00a0push clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, they might focus more on the care they offer\u00a0which can\u00a0be\u00a0more neutral.\u00a0You may need to tinker with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/19\/adwords-headline-formulas\">headlines and descriptions <\/a>on this one.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Trademarks in ad text<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>You\u2019ve included another business\u2019s brand name in your ad copy,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/2562645#auth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unauthorized<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-approved-limited-1.jpg\" alt=\"approved limited notification from google ads\" width=\"490\" height=\"255\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>This could easily happen by accident since some company\u2019s brand names can be the same as generalized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\">search terms<\/a>.\u00a0When you get the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6118?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trademark disapproval<\/a>,\u00a0your ad is most likely still running, but it will be limited\u00a0as to\u00a0when Google will deem it eligible to show.<\/p>\n<p>There is a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/legal\/contact\/external_consult_wf?product=adwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support form<\/a>\u00a0where you can dispute your use of the \u201ctrademarked\u201d term.

Copyrighted content<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0This is\u00a0similar to\u00a0the disapproval above, where your ad text contains content that\u2019s been copyrighted.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-copyrighted-content-1.jpg\" alt=\"google ads disapproval for copyrighted content\" width=\"745\" height=\"175\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0If you\u2019re authorized to use such content, then you\u2019ll need\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/contact\/copyright\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">submit copyrighted documentation<\/a>\u00a0from the original owner that proves your eligibility.

Image quality<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Your display ad is disapproved due to wrong image specifics.

So, if Google spits back an image you can resubmit with a new one.<\/p>\n<p>However, if your heart is set on using a specific image, then cross-check it with Google\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6021546?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image quality\u00a0guidelines<\/a>\u00a0to look for any missing pieces you can change to get your display ad to run.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Misrepresentation<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0In simple terms, it means Google is considering your ad\u00a0or landing page\u00a0to be behaving\u00a0similar to\u00a0a \u201cbait and switch.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-misrepresentation-1.png\" alt=\"google ads disapproval for misrepresentation\" width=\"304\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ppchero.com\/top-10-reasons-why-your-ads-arent-showing-in-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6020955?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misrepresentation Google Ads disapproval<\/a>\u00a0has a whole slew of reasons behind it.

Inappropriate\u00a0content<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0This may go without saying, but this of course means\u00a0Google deemed your\u00a0ad\u00a0or landing page\u00a0to be\u00a0containing\u00a0wording, phrases, or images that show explicit, violent, or otherwise generally\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6015406?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inappropriate content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0Think of the Google Ads space as G-rated. I&#8217;ve even seen certain types of doctors, like plastic surgeons, get the inappropriate content\u00a0flag.\u00a0While it may be necessary for those types of businesses to include such content, Google\u2019s review process is automated and may not necessarily screen for context.<\/p>\n<p>If you absolutely need to include such content in your ad, you can still run\u00a0the ad\u00a0(it will say \u201capproved: limited\u201d meaning you\u2019ll have targeting restrictions),\u00a0but you\u2019ll need to follow\u00a0our steps below to dispute your incorrect disapproval first.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, if you are unsure what the culprit is, take a look\u00a0back through all components of your\u00a0Google advertising through a G-rated\u00a0lens\u00a0and remove any questionable content.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Unsupported language<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>Your ad or landing page is in a language that isn\u2019t supported by Google Ad\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/1722078\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">language targeting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6088505?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unsupported language disapproval<\/a>\u00a0falls under the \u201ctechnical requirements\u201d policy umbrella which allows your content to be as user-friendly as possible. Note that your ad or landing page doesn\u2019t need to be in English, but it will have to be in a language Google supports via language targeting. So, ensure your campaign language targeting is set to the language you\u2019d like and adjust your content accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Dishonest behavior<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Google Ads has values in fairness and honesty put in place to keep a level playing field.\u00a0Therefore\u00a0if your ad or landing page is encouraging customers to mislead others\u00a0or gather unauthorized data,\u00a0then you may see the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6016086?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dishonest Behavior disapproval<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-enabling-dishonest-behavior-1.png\" alt=\"google ads disapproval for dishonest behavior\" width=\"232\" height=\"208\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>Be careful of this one because after you\u00a0receive a warning on your account for this disapproval,\u00a0your account will be suspended after seven days.

Dangerous products or services<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:\u00a0<\/strong>Ads\u00a0promoting\u00a0explosives, recreational drugs, tobacco, knives, and other weapons aren\u2019t allowed on the SERP.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-dangerous-products-1.png\" alt=\"google ads disapproval for dangerous products\" width=\"624\" height=\"80\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6014299?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dangerous products or services disapproval<\/a>\u00a0can pop up time again for firearm-related accounts.

Repetition<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Your ad, ad extension,\u00a0or landing page is deemed too poor of quality due to repetitive words.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0You might call this keyword stuffing if you\u2019re trying to use the same keyword over and over in attempt to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-impression-share\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boost your impression share<\/a>.

On top of this,\u00a0all of\u00a0your content must be appropriate for a young audience.<\/p>\n<p>If your\u00a0display or\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/05\/video-ad-ideas\">video ad<\/a>,\u00a0or ad text,\u00a0is deemed not okay for someone under the age of 13 to see, then your ad will get disapproved. You could try re-strategizing to angle your products (whether it be toys, shows, books, etc.) to the parents, or adjust your copy to be more family-friendly.<\/p>\n<h3>18.\u00a0Approved (limited)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0Google has categorized your ad, ad extension, or landing page to fall under a policy, but you are abiding by the guidelines. Therefore<u>,<\/u>\u00a0your ad is running as\u00a0normal\u00a0but it may have some targeting restrictions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong>\u00a0You might want to leave this one be as there\u2019s nothing wrong with your ad.\u00a0But,\u00a0this is Google\u2019s way of reminding you that you do fall under a specific category that may have restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you go ahead and exclude by a demographic in\u00a0the\u00a0future on an ad that has this flag, then you\u2019ll end up getting disapproved. This is common for those within the vicinity of the new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/143465?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">housing, employment, and credit policies<\/a>\u00a0implemented by Google back in 2019.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Industry-specific disapprovals<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What it means:<\/strong>\u00a0While I can\u2019t address every single\u00a0policy\u00a0Google has in place that could trigger a disapproval, I did want to give an honorable mention to all the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6368711?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1626336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">industry-specific Google Ads policies<\/a>\u00a0out there.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-industry-specific-1.jpg\" alt=\"google ads industry-specific disapproval\" width=\"515\" height=\"205\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:\u00a0<\/strong>Keep in mind what vertical you\u2019re in as well as any and every topic within your industry\u00a0that\u00a0Google may find questionable.\u00a0If you think there\u2019s a risk in what you\u2019re looking to advertise, then take baby steps by testing out a\u00a0neutral\u00a0search ad, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>You may also want to be careful with your targeting, to avoid any issues later. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/22\/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey\">personalized<\/a> advertising applies to many industries for which you can\u2019t exclude certain demographics or execute remarketing.\u00a0Some example industries include the following: anything relating to medical, restaurants selling alcohol, senior care, housing, credit, employment, law,\u00a0immigration services,\u00a0and more.<\/p>\n<h2>How to appeal your Google Ads disapproval<\/h2>\n<p>Like I\u00a0mentioned, in most cases your disapproval is just a mistake by Google\u2019s automated review process. So, regardless\u00a0of whether\u00a0you try the tricks mentioned by policy above, here\u00a0are\u00a0the three\u00a0must\u00a0do steps for your\u00a0disapprovals\u2014especially if you feel you shouldn\u2019t be getting the disapproval you now have:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Double check everything else first<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is to go through your ad text, extensions, and landing page with a scrutinous fine-tooth comb and identify any areas that might make you stop and think. Even if you\u2019re unsure how to fix or change the possible\u00a0culprit, it\u2019s helpful to have a few account locations in mind for when you\u2019re working with Google support next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:\u00a0<\/strong>Even if you\u2019re thinking \u201cImpossible! How could I have (insert wacky policy disapproval here) in my ad or landing page?!\u201d\u2014 don\u2019t underestimate the thoroughness of Google\u2019s policies.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Appeal<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t find anything outwardly disapproval-worthy, go ahead with the appeal. If you hover over your disapproval in the status column, you\u2019ll usually get the option to appeal (though there are a few policies, like \u201cdangerous products or service,\u201d that won\u2019t allow\u00a0for an appeal). Click appeal and\u00a0select which ads you\u2019d like to appeal.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapproval-appeal-1.jpg\" alt=\"google ads disapproval appeal form\" width=\"775\" height=\"275\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You\u2019ll also have the option to dispute the decision (for those who think the disapproval is completely off base) or mention that you made changes to comply (if you tried the steps above). Appeals usually go through within a few business days, and you can check the status in your Policy Manager from the top toolbar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:\u00a0<\/strong>Don\u2019t overwhelm the system with appeals. If you appeal\u00a0multiple disapprovals for\u00a0the same ad\u00a0in quick succession,\u00a0it\u00a0can \u201cconfuse\u201d the automated appeal review and\u00a0delay the approval. The same goes if you submit\u00a0duplicate\u00a0appeals for the same disapproval, without waiting a day or so.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Contact Google\u00a0support<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, you\u2019ll\u00a0most likely need to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/gethelp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact\u00a0Google Support<\/a>. There is a support form that usually turns around in a week or two. I recommend mentioning in that request that you\u2019re looking for a manual review.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-support-form-1.png\" alt=\"google ads support form\" width=\"641\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Additionally, be as detailed as possible on what disapproval you\u2019re getting, where in the account it is, and what you\u2019ve done so far to fix it. While it\u2019s tempting to just type in \u201cReapprove my ads now!\u201d and hit submit, this extra information will\u00a0save you time later.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, the support form will get you in touch with a real person where\u00a0you can explain your\u00a0specific situation in detail and learn the steps to get you back on track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong>\u00a0Wait two weeks, and if you haven\u2019t heard back, submit another form to increase urgency.<\/p>\n<h2>How to prevent Google Ads\u00a0disapprovals<\/h2>\n<p>Disapprovals can be pesky, and the best strategy here is to prevent them from happening in the first place. This isn&#8217;t always possible, but here are some general tips.<\/p>\n<h3>If you\u2019re questioning it, don\u2019t do\u00a0it<\/h3>\n<p>Meaning, if you\u2019re worried it might get disapproved, it will probably get disapproved. While it\u2019s unfortunate we can\u2019t all <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/08\/broad-match-audience-targeting-google-ads\">layer on the targeting <\/a>or ad copy we ideally want, the silver lining is this will push us to be <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/20\/creative-advertising-ideas\">creative<\/a>. Think outside of the box on\u00a0how you finesse your ad or targeting while staying within the confines of Google\u2019s policies.<\/p>\n<h3>Check your landing pages\u00a0regularly<\/h3>\n<p>One takeaway from\u00a0all of\u00a0the issues above is that a bulk of common disapprovals happen outside of your ad account. So, check your website\u00a0just as much as you check your ads. You\u2019ll want to keep an eye for any changes in content or the final URL.<\/p>\n<h3>Always have other channels running<\/h3>\n<p>If you feel as though you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle with Google Ads disapprovals, this is a good way of ensuring\u00a0you\u2019re still getting brand exposure via other avenues. A great alternative while you\u2019re\u00a0sorting out any Google Ads disapprovals is to run ads on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/22\/set-up-microsoft-ads-event-tracking\">Microsoft Ads<\/a> or Facebook (but avoid these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/05\/facebook-ad-mistakes\">Facebook ad mistakes<\/a>!).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-disapprovals-alternative20channels-1.png\" alt=\"alternatives to google ads\" width=\"720\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t let Google Ads disapprovals get you down<\/h2>\n<p>If there\u2019s one\u00a0thing\u00a0we\u2019ve gathered from this\u00a0Google Ad\u00a0disapproval jungle is that most advertisers on Google will encounter at least one ad\u00a0disapproval at some point in their career.\u00a0And\u00a0that is okay!<\/p>\n<p>Google wants to see you succeed\u00a0(they wouldn\u2019t be where they are today if they didn\u2019t!)\u00a0and the support team will be there to help you through it.\u00a0The key to navigating a disapproval is to remain calm, identify the culprit if any, and then follow troubleshooting steps from there.<\/p>\n<p>As with any form of marketing, always have a backup account, campaign, or ad ready to run in your back pocket in case of emergency.\u00a0That way, you\u2019ll always be showing to viewers no matter what!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s finish off with the full list of disapprovals covered in this post:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Destination not
