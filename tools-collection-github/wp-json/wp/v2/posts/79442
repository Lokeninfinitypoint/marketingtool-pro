We had to do some mental gymnastics to average out the research results. Look at the best times to post from these three top studies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/best-time-to-post-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a>: noon, Monday<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot:<\/a> 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., Friday<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/best-times-to-post-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprout Social:<\/a> 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Why is the HubSpot data <em>so<\/em> different? Because it\u2019s based on a survey of marketers rather than actual user data. We thought the difference between marketers\u2019 perception of the best time to post and actual user data was interesting, so we left it in. But we leaned more heavily on the user-based studies for our conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>But even without HubSpot, there\u2019s still a big spread in the results!<\/p>\n<p>It turns out, you can\u2019t just pick one golden publishing hour that\u2019s the ideal time to post for every social media account. You have to consider things like your audience, the type of content you publish, and how people consume your content.<\/p>\n<p>The platform you post on dictates a lot of these variables\u2014people watch YouTube videos at different times than they read text on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s dig a bit deeper into each platform. That way, if you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/24\/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes\">cross-publish content<\/a> in various formats (hint: you should!), you\u2019ll have some times to target for successful posts.<\/p>\n<div id=\"The-best-time-to-post-on-Facebook\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#The-best-time-to-post-on-Facebook\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the best time to post on Facebook?<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>The overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/06\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook\">best time to post on Facebook<\/a> is 10 a.m. on Monday and Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - chart showing the best time each day to post on Facebook.\" width=\"936\" height=\"307\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79446 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook-480x157.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The best days to post on Facebook:<\/strong> Monday through Thursday<\/p>\n<p><strong>The worst day to post on Facebook:<\/strong> Sunday<\/p>\n<p>You can see that the best times to post on Facebook closely followed the overall trend.

While people still head to the platform for some passive distraction, the app is also becoming a popular place to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">find new products<\/a>. That means you\u2019ll want to post a mix of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-ad-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entertaining TikToks<\/a>, educational content, and promotional posts. Focus your post to publish later on weekdays and earlier on weekends to start, but try a few more informative posts mid-morning.<\/p>\n<div id=\"The-best-time-to-post-on-YouTube\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#The-best-time-to-post-on-YouTube\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the best time to post on YouTube?<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>The overall<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-youtube\"> best time to post on YouTube<\/a> is 6 p.m. on Friday.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-youtube.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - chart showing the best time each day to post on YouTube\" width=\"936\" height=\"301\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79449 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-youtube.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-youtube-480x154.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The best day to post on YouTube: <\/strong>Friday<\/p>\n<p><strong>The worst day to post on YouTube: <\/strong>Monday<\/p>\n<p>There are fewer recent studies on the best times to post on YouTube.

It\u2019s a good idea to publish a couple of posts each day early in the week. We\u2019ve seen from the other platforms that video content gets more engagement later in the day, so keep your text-heavy posts for the morning.

Let that tell you when to post on each social media platform.<\/p>\n<h3>See when your audience is online<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not just video length or content type that suggests when you should post on social media. You also have to know when your specific audience is on each platform.<\/p>\n<p>For example, what if you\u2019re posting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ohO95wWMV2o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30-minute montage<\/a> of scenes from the cartoon Paw Patrol.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-paw-patrol.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on social media - Screenshot of a Paw Patrol video from Facebook.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79453 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-paw-patrol.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-paw-patrol-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ohO95wWMV2o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sure, it\u2019s a long-form video. But the audience is not likely working a 9-5 (no shame if you are), so weekday mornings might be just fine.<\/p>\n<p>How can you tell when your audience is online? Look at the analytics available on each platform.<\/p>\n<p>Over on TikTok, you get an hourly graph showing the peaks and valleys of audience engagement on your account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-tiktok-analytics.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - TikTok analytics screenshot.\" width=\"375\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79454 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-tiktok-analytics.webp 375w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-tiktok-analytics-188x300.webp 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Instagram, and others also give you lots of data. Dive in and you\u2019ll know exactly when to post on each platform.<\/p>\n<h3>Review previous posts<\/h3>\n<p>Deciding when to post on social media is a bit like the game Battleship. You plunk a post down at a specific point on the calendar and if it\u2019s a hit, you keep trying around that time. If you don\u2019t get much engagement, you aim for a different place on the board.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll head back to your analytics dashboards to track which posting times are a hit and which are a miss.<\/p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways to do it. The first option is to look at the metrics of each post individually.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-insights-3.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - Instagram analytics..\" width=\"384\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79455 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-insights-3.webp 384w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-insights-3-192x300.webp 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Create a spreadsheet with columns for the post, the platform, and the time it was published. Then head to the individual post analytics to see how many likes, shares, etc. each collected.<\/p>\n<p>If you publish different types of content at different times in the day, you could also look at the performance of each of those types, like from this Facebook report.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook-analytics.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - Facebook analytics\" width=\"936\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79456 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook-analytics.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-facebook-analytics-480x281.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your afternoon videos are way outperforming your morning image-only posts, you could try to shift more of your posts to the afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how you review, you\u2019ll start to see patterns in your social media publishing schedule that can inform future posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Complete a competitive review<\/h3>\n<p>You can learn a lot from looking at accounts similar to yours on social media. If they\u2019re getting tons of engagement by posting on Friday afternoons, you should test those times, too.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to find accounts that share the same type of content for a similar audience. You don\u2019t want to post like a Paw Patrol fan account with your Last of Us recap content.<\/p>\n<p>Once you find the right competitors, simply look at their most popular content and see when they posted it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-garden.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on soical media - screenshot of an instagram post about lawncare.\" width=\"668\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79457 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-garden.webp 668w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Best-time-to-post-on-social-media-wordstream-garden-480x431.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 668px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CzgeBCQuJSy\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The accounts that have been around a while likely know when the best time is to post on social media.
