We\u2019re not talking about account management. We\u2019re not talking about optimizations. We\u2019re just talking about <em>reporting<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Allen Iverson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wasn\u2019t saying<\/a> that practice was unimportant to his role as the face of the Philadelphia 76ers franchise, and I\u2019m not saying that reporting is unimportant to your role as the manager of your clients\u2019 online advertising accounts.<\/p>\n<p>What I <em>am<\/em> saying is that you\u2019d better be getting as much as you can out of all the time you spend on reporting\u2014<strong>by ensuring that you\u2019re communicating the value your agency is really providing to each client<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you communicate with clients and customers\u2014the right way? To help you do just that, I sat down with three of WordStream\u2019s in-house account management experts. Holly Niemiec, Scott Mesite, and Mike Emiliani each work on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> team\u00a0driving positive returns on their clients\u2019 investments each and every month. I spoke with each of them about what it takes to communicate with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/16\/get-more-clients\">clients<\/a> effectively. In the end, we were able to boil down their insights to these <strong>five essential pillars of client communication<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Transparency<\/li>\n<li>Empathy<\/li>\n<li>Self-awareness<\/li>\n<li>Context<\/li>\n<li>Flexibility<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at each of these qualities in turn and explore how they fit together to yield healthier relationships with your clients.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Transparency<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ll start with transparency, quite simply, because it\u2019s the most important pillar on this list. If your communication with your clients is nothing else, <strong>it should be transparent.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou always, always, <em>always<\/em> have to tell your clients like it is,\u201d Mike told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve got good news or bad news. Tell them what they need to know, and tell them when they need to know it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The importance of transparency is two-fold. Primarily, you need to be transparent because you\u2019re partially responsible for the success of somebody else\u2019s business. You can never forget that you\u2019re spending someone else\u2019s hard-earned money. They deserve to know what it\u2019s yielding\u2014and, perhaps more importantly, what it\u2019s <em>not<\/em> yielding.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-transparency.jpg\" alt=\"client-communication-sample-metrics\" width=\"800\" height=\"385\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Something to talk about.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondarily, transparency is crucial because it gives you more security in the long run. \u201cBad stuff will always make its way back to the person who\u2019s responsible,\u201d says Mike. \u201cIf you make a mistake, get it out in the open as soon as possible. You\u2019ll be better off for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The good news: It\u2019s not hard to be transparent. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going over performance metrics,\u201d advises Scott, \u201cshare your screen with the client. If you let them see exactly what you\u2019re seeing, you won\u2019t even give yourself the opportunity to be opaque.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although a complete list of marketing buzzwords would make a CVS receipt look like a stick of peppermint gum made for ants, there\u2019s one in particular that you\u2019ll often hear in the context of account management: <strong>granular.<\/strong> It\u2019s typically used to describe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">well-structured ad groups<\/a>, but it\u2019s relevant to the topic of transparency, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t simply show your clients how much you\u2019re spending at the account level,\u201d Holly told me. \u201cYou should walk them through what you\u2019re spending on different initiatives at specific points in the marketing funnel. Be thorough. Make it a conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Empathy<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s an amazing <em>It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ksJpuznVJFM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scene<\/a> in which Dennis asks Mac if he remembers feelings. \u201cDennis, I have feelings every single day of my life,\u201d he responds. \u201cDo you\u2014do you not have feelings?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although nobody should ever aspire to be an <em>Always Sunny<\/em> character, if you\u2019re going to emulate one of the two men featured in that scene, it should be Mac. <strong>Having empathy for your clients is one of the most crucial parts of being an account manager.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think of yourself as an external contractor, everybody\u2019s worse off,\u201d says Holly. \u201cYou should consider yourself a legitimate part of the team at every business you serve. You\u2019ll feel more engaged by the work you\u2019re doing and you\u2019ll drive better results for your clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because thinking of yourself as a member of your clients\u2019 teams forces you to put yourself in their shoes, and putting yourself in their shoes enables you to more closely align with their ultimate goal: <strong>to grow their businesses.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-empathy.jpg\" alt=\"client-communication-campaign-comparison\" width=\"554\" height=\"292\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Performance data is more than just numbers in a spreadsheet.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another reason to actively understand your clients\u2019 perspectives is that doing so will inform how you communicate results to them. \u201cI have some really involved, hands-on clients, but a lot of them just want a bird\u2019s-eye view of performance,\u201d Scott told me. \u201cI know how busy running their businesses keeps them. I don\u2019t want them to have to think about digital marketing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, that distinction between running a business and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\">mastering digital marketing<\/a> is at the core of the third pillar.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Self-awareness<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of all the pillars of effective client communication, this is probably the one that\u2019s most lacking in everyday life\u2014at least as far as I can tell. Recently, a woman sitting next to me on the commuter rail spilled some of her oatmeal on my pants. If you\u2019re wondering whether she apologized, rest assured that she did <em>not<\/em>. She didn\u2019t even notice that it had happened, actually. Now <em>that\u2019s<\/em> a serious lack of self-awareness.<\/p>\n<p>(No\u2014I didn\u2019t say anything to her about it. I\u2019m a painfully passive person. I\u2019m not working on it.)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-self-awareness.gif\" alt=\"client-communication-scrubs\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"24b91f85-43fa-4c30-a8ce-dd40f6d98ded\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the context of communicating with a client, self-awareness means distinguishing and recognizing the roles you each play. This, like being transparent, is pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>Your client runs their business. You run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/09\/facebook-plus-google\">their online advertising accounts<\/a>. <em>That\u2019s it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial that you both let this distinction inform how you interact with one another. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to know your clients\u2019 businesses or industries as well as they do,\u201d says Holly. \u201cEven though you\u2019re the digital marketing expert in the relationship, the fact of the matter is that you\u2019re going to have to defer to their judgements sometimes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mike was keen to point out to me, however, that there\u2019s a big difference between deferring to clients\u2019 judgements and letting clients get into the weeds of their accounts: \u201cAs much as I respect my clients\u2019 smarts when it comes to their businesses and their businesses\u2019 positions in the market, I think it\u2019s for the best that they limit the amount of tinkering they do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The consensus: While making it clear that you\u2019re the account manager, open the door for collaboration and new ideas. Scott put this best, I think: \u201cI listen to what they have to say and let their insights inform my strategies.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Context<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contextualization is all about framing the challenge or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/30\/ppc-client-business-questions\">question you\u2019re facing<\/a> within the bigger picture. This came up on two different instances over the course of my conversations with Holly, Scott, and Mike.<\/p>\n<p>The first instance pertains to how you should respond when a client is frustrated with something that\u2019s out of your control. Both Mike and Scott raised this point as a tangent to our discussions of self-awareness. \u201cAs an account manager, there\u2019s only so much you can do for your clients,\u201d explained Scott. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019re going to come after you for problems that you have absolutely no control over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you deal with that? \u201cYou have to contextualize the problem,\u201d Mike says. \u201cDon\u2019t deflect, and don\u2019t get defensive. After you\u2019ve validated their frustration, try your best to frame the problem in its broader context.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-context.jpg\" alt=\"client-communication-facebook-offer-ad\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Offer ads can only do so much for a brick-and-mortar. Via <a href=\"https:\/\/static.adweek.com\/adweek.com-prod\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2016\/08\/FBOffersUpdatesTeaser.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adweek<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be more specific, if a client is frustrated because a new experiment has yet to show returns, Holly suggests that you emphasize the long-run: \u201cEbbs and flows are inherent to digital marketing. Nothing happens overnight. You and your clients have to be on the same page as far as everyone\u2019s expectations go.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The <em>other<\/em> instance pertains to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/29\/google-shopping-promotions\">seasonality<\/a>. If monthly or quarterly performance takes an unexpected turn for the worse, Scott recommends framing the problem in a historical context. \u201cBy using a year-over-year performance comparison rather than the more typical month-over-month comparison,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou can make sense of below-average performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. Flexibility<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fifth and final key to communicating with clients in a healthy, effective manner is your ability to adjust to different personality types. Some of your clients will treat you like a friend\u2014taking interest in your personal life and expecting you to reciprocate. Others will be strictly business\u2014wanting nothing more than for you to stop talking about your unremarkable child\u2019s baseball team and start telling them what they need to know.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/client-communication-flexibility.gif\" alt=\"client-communication-scale-of-caring\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"61d4e20a-55a2-40aa-92ec-2aec84bc7fa4\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holly, Mike, and Scott each tied this subject back to the importance of behaving as if you\u2019re a member of your clients\u2019 teams. \u201cSure\u2014every client is different,\u201d says Holly. \u201cBut, generally speaking, the more personal engagement you have with one another, the better sense you\u2019ll have of the relationship\u2019s health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mike does, however, recommend keeping things natural: \u201cYou can\u2019t force a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/21\/build-client-relationships\">client relationship<\/a> to go one way or another. If they want to open up, they\u2019ll open up. If they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t. You just have to be flexible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Clients are not only different in terms of how much\u2014if at all\u2014they want to be your friend; they\u2019re <em>also<\/em> different in terms of how much they want to know about their accounts. Again, flexibility is essential to your success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome of my clients are totally happy with a high-level review of account performance,\u201d says Scott. \u201cOthers want me to zoom in on specific campaigns and metrics. No matter what, you have to give the client what they want.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Approaching client communication strategically<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Communicating with clients can feel like a daunting, disconnected task. After all, a Venn diagram with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">Grouping Keywords<\/a> on one side and Talking to Humans on the other side doesn\u2019t have much of a middle section.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, <strong>your efficacy as a digital marketing account manager\u2014and even the success of your agency\u2014rests in large part on your ability to report and collaborate effectively.<\/strong> If you can\u2019t implement the tips and insights provided by Holly, Scott, and Mike, you\u2019re going to struggle to retain clients. In turn, you\u2019ll struggle to win the referrals that agencies so commonly rely on.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you take the steps to be more transparent, empathetic, self-aware, contextually minded, and flexible, you\u2019ll start noticing an improvement in your client relationships in no time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your standing as a digital agency rests on your ability to communicate with your clients effectively.
