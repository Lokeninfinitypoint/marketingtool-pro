Marketing will become even more personalized<\/h3>\n<p>Among the digital marketing trends expected to accelerate in 2024 is the movement toward not just personalization, but hyper-personalization, thanks in part to new AI tools.<\/p>\n<p>That runs the gamut from content to product recommendations and user experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAI and machine learning\u2026will be used not only to analyze consumer behavior but also to predict future trends and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/personalized-marketing\" rel=\"noopener\">personalize marketing<\/a> efforts dynamically,\u201d said Michael Schmied, lead financial consultant at <a href=\"https:\/\/krediteschweiz.ch\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kredite Schweiz<\/a>. \u201cExpect more sophisticated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/05\/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-driven content creation tools<\/a>, customer service <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/chatbot-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chatbots<\/a>, and predictive analytics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/marketing-channels-live-chat-example.png\" alt=\"marketing channels - example of live chat\" width=\"310\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/marketing-channels-live-chat-example.png 310w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/marketing-channels-live-chat-example-166x300.png 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This, said freelance SEO specialist <a href=\"https:\/\/ph.linkedin.com\/in\/linisseve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seve Paulo Linis<\/a>, will help businesses engage audiences more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2024, digital marketing strategies are likely to leverage AI to generate content that is not just tailored to specific demographic segments but to individual user preferences and behaviors,\u201d added Rachit Jawa, co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.miscgyan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MiscGyan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis means content that adapts in real-time based on user interaction, providing a highly personalized experience that boosts engagement and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/11\/increase-conversion-rates\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion rates<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"multimodal-ai-will-impact-search-results\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Multimodal AI will change search results<\/h3>\n<p>For his part, Mike Grehan, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/chelseadigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chelsea Digital<\/a>, anticipates even more personalization in search engine results pages (SERPs).<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because not all the world\u2019s information is currently on the World Wide Web\u2014and search engines like Google can\u2019t crawl a lot of information that is online. Because large language models base their results on crawled content, they, too, have been limited in their inputs and outputs.<\/p>\n<p>However, moving forward, Grehan expects <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-marketing-trends-2024#:~:text=7.-,More%20use%20of%20multimodal%20AI,-Multimodal%20AI%20combines\" rel=\"noopener\">AI will open up multimodal sources of input<\/a> like digital assistants\u2014and even images and videos\u2014for even more personalized responses from search engines.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt could be text, but could also be spoken word, a personalized video created in real-time, or maybe even just music,\u201d Grehan said. \u201cIt all depends on the characteristics of the information needed and the most appropriate content experience to match it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, he expects organic results to become less text-based and more visual\u2014including the addition of augmented reality, which will enable what Grehan called \u201coutside the browser experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"local-marketing-to-grow-in-importance\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Local marketing will continue to grow in importance<\/h3>\n<p>Alongside more personalized experiences, marketers anticipate <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more localized efforts<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBrands will focus on creating highly tailored experiences and content that resonate with specific local demographics,\u201d Schmied said.<\/p>\n<p>Md Tajuddin Sadique, CTO of Mediainfo7.com, agreed, calling it a \u201cglocal approach\u201d when brands tailor their messages to resonate with local communities while retaining a global brand identity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThink localized influencer partnerships, hyper-relevant <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-social-media-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media content<\/a>, and community-driven initiatives that address local needs,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine a global clothing brand collaborating with local designers to create culturally inspired collections or a fast food chain launching menu items unique to specific cities. This focus on hyper-local relevance will build deeper connections and cultivate brand loyalty beyond national borders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-digital-marketing-trends-glocal-approach-canes-example.webp\" alt=\"glocal marketing example raising cane's\" width=\"936\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-digital-marketing-trends-glocal-approach-canes-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-digital-marketing-trends-glocal-approach-canes-example-480x247.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This restaurant opened a Dallas Cowboys-themed location in the Dallas area to appeal to its local customers.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"businesses-launch-more-immersive-experiences\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Businesses will launch more immersive experiences<\/h3>\n<p>In a similar vein, expect to see more immersive experiences from brands in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>That includes virtual environments like the metaverse for more interactive experiences, as well as more AR and VR in marketing campaigns for more immersive storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBrace yourselves for a seamless merger of digital and physical realms,\u201d said Neha Gharpande, digital marketing professional at <a href=\"https:\/\/aristasystems.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arista Systems<\/a>. \u201cAugmented reality will play a pivotal role, allowing consumers to virtually experience products before making a purchase. Marketers will need to explore creative ways to leverage AR for immersive brand interactions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jawa, too, anticipates a \u201csurge in AR-driven campaigns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis technology will not only enhance customer engagement but also provide more detailed data on customer interactions, which can be used to further refine marketing strategies,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div id=\"marketers-become-more-transparent\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Marketers will have to become more transparent<\/h3>\n<p>With 2024 bringing the long-awaited <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/privacy-sandbox\/blog\/cookie-countdown-2023oct#:~:text=To%20facilitate%20testing%2C%20Chrome%20has,UK's%20Competition%20and%20Markets%20Authority.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">end of third-party cookies<\/a>, consumer data and privacy will be top of mind as well\u2014which means even more emphasis on first-party data collection and the continued growth of retail media platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith heightened concerns about data privacy, marketers will face increasing pressure to prioritize user data protection,\u201d Gharpande said. \u201cAdhering to stringent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\" rel=\"noopener\">data regulations<\/a> and implementing robust security measures will be imperative to foster trust with consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It may also include the addition of blockchain technology for additional transparency and security\u2014particularly in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/programmatic-advertising\">programmatic advertising<\/a> and to combat ad fraud, Schmied added.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Sadique expects to see more from the data detox movement, which asks brands to \u201cprioritize trust through <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ethical data collection<\/a>, clear consent mechanisms, and user-centric personalization.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine a world where targeted ads are based on preferences explicitly shared by users, rather than shadowy inferences from their browsing history,\u201d he added. \u201cThis shift necessitates a creative approach to understanding audiences, leveraging declared interests, and opting in [to] data instead of hidden algorithms.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"consumers-to-seek-value-oriented-businesses\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Consumers will seek value-oriented businesses<\/h3>\n<p>Another ongoing digital marketing trend expected to retain momentum is a focus on consumer values.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs societal consciousness continues to grow, consumers will demand more transparency and ethical practices from brands,\u201d Gharpande said. \u201cDigital marketers will need to champion sustainability and authenticity, weaving these values into their campaigns to establish meaningful connections with conscious consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earth-day-campaign-example.jpg\" alt=\"example of cause-based marketing campaign on instagram\" width=\"664\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earth-day-campaign-example.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/earth-day-campaign-example-480x318.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Schmied agreed, noting, \u201cDigital marketing campaigns that highlight a brand\u2019s commitment to sustainability and social responsibility will likely resonate more with audiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"social-shopping-to-take-off\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Social shopping will take off (even more!)<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, it has taken some time for social commerce to take off in the US, but social media darling TikTok may finally have cracked the code.<\/p>\n<p>According to Toccara Karizma, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.karizmamarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Karizma Marketing<\/a>, TikTok social commerce sales hit $53.1 billion in 2023, which is up 34%.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis growth highlights the platform&#8217;s potential as a lucrative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-101\" rel=\"noopener\">digital marketing strategy<\/a> for ecommerce brands in 2024, especially when combined with influencer marketing,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, brands that feature their products on TikTok Shop can work with micro-influencers to extend their reach.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"shoppable tiktok ads example\" width=\"664\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example-480x303.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Gharpande agreed we\u2019ll see social media platforms evolve into full-fledged shopping destinations in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe integration of ecommerce features directly into social apps will redefine the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\" rel=\"noopener\">online shopping experience<\/a>,\u201d she said. \u201cMarketers should capitalize on these trends by creating seamless shopping journeys within social ecosystems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sadique also expects to see conversational commerce grow thanks to platforms like Shopify and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine browsing for a new outfit through WhatsApp messages or customizing your dream vacation via voice commands,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024, expect brands to leverage conversational interfaces for frictionless transactions, personalized recommendations, and on-demand customer support.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Make the most of these 2024 digital marketing trends<\/h2>\n<p>By understanding these 2024 digital marketing trends and predictions, your business can stay ahead of the curve and look for ways to better connect with your audience across channels, messaging, and more.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Running Google Ads and not sure how they&#8217;re performing?
