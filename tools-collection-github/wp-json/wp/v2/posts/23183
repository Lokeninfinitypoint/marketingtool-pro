Sure, <em>you<\/em> think your precious little angel is just adorable (and just so we\u2019re clear, we\u2019re talking about your website now), yet when you head into Google Analytics to check the numbers, your bounce rate tells a different story.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to come to terms with. After all, you love your website, so why doesn\u2019t everybody else?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-header.png\" alt=\"How to reduce bounce rate\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>What Is a Good Bounce Rate?<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so too is what constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d bounce rate. Some sites might view a bounce rate of 80% as awesome, whereas other sites might see this as nothing short of catastrophic. It really depends on your site and business goals.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, many site managers and webmasters pay close attention to bounce rate as an overall indication of a site\u2019s \u201cstickiness\u201d or appeal, and would like to reduce this troublesome number as much as they can. Some people even think that bounce rate can influence your search rankings, via Google\u2019s new machine-learning algorithm <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/16\/rankbrain-seo\">RankBrain<\/a>. So it\u2019s obviously in your interest to optimize this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">SEO metric.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, we\u2019ll look at 11 ways you can do just that.<\/p>\n<p>However, before we dive in, we need to talk about the flaws inherent in bounce rate as a performance metric and what this means for you as a marketer.<\/p>\n<h2>A Brief Note About the Problems with Bounce Rate<\/h2>\n<p>Alongside Bounce Rate, you\u2019ve probably noticed the Time on Page metric in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">Google Analytics<\/a>. This, as its name implies, is an estimate of how long on average users spend on a given page. The reason Time on Page is an approximated metric, rather than a clearly defined measurement, is because Google Analytics (and other analytics platforms) requires two clicks to accurately calculate Time on Page; an \u201centrance\u201d click \u2013\u00a0 typically the link click that brings a user to a page in the first place \u2013 and an \u201cexit\u201d click, usually a click on a navigational element that takes them away from a page.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this crucial exit click is often missing from the equation. Ever spent a few minutes reading a page before closing the tab (or the browser)? If so, Google Analytics couldn\u2019t accurately measure the Time on Page because it missed that vital exit click during that particular session. In this example, it doesn\u2019t matter if a user clicked onto a page, read every single last word of an 8,000-word blog post, and left entirely satisfied \u2013 if they closed the tab without exit clicking, that session is logged as a bounce. The same goes for sessions in which a user opens a link in another tab and leaves the original tab open before eventually closing their browser.<\/p>\n<p>This is why bounce rate, as a metric, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/18\/stupid-marketing-metrics\">kind of sucks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-regular-show.gif\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate Regular Show Rigby You're Ruining My Life\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Rigby knows how much bounce rate sucks.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a result of this inherent flaw, many marketers are moving away from their reliance on bounce rate as a metric and are instead focusing on so-called <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/22\/content-marketing-metrics\">\u201cattention metrics\u201d<\/a> such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/10\/dwell-time\">dwell time<\/a> and scroll depth. It\u2019s simply too difficult to accurately measure bounce rate (and Time on Page), but it\u2019s still worth trying to keep your bounce rates low.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if your bounce rate is insanely high, or suddenly spikes due to changes you\u2019ve made on your site, you\u2019ve got a major problem to deal with.<\/p>\n<p>With that caveat out of the way, let\u2019s look at how you can make your pages stickier and reduce that pesky bounce rate.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Optimize Page Load Time<\/h2>\n<p>Many marketers assume that if their bounce rate is high, the issue must lie with a page\u2019s content \u2013 when, in fact, serious problems can arise before a user even has the chance to read a page at all.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the problems a web page can have, taking forever to load is arguably the worst. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter how good or bad a page\u2019s content is if a user can\u2019t read it (or even see it), and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/loading-time\/\">47% of users expect a web page to load in two seconds or less<\/a>, making on-page optimization crucial to reducing your bounce rate.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-loading-gif.gif\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate loading gif\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is especially true for mobile sites. According to data from Radware, a connection speed delay of just 500 milliseconds can result in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.radware.com\/applicationdelivery\/applicationaccelerationoptimization\/2014\/01\/55-web-performance-stats-youll-want-to-know\/\">an increase in \u201cpeak frustration\u201d of more than 26%<\/a>, and a decrease in engagement of 8%.<\/p>\n<p>Further, slow-loading pages are among the leading causes of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">shopping cart abandonment<\/a> for ecommerce retailers. Amazingly, only 2% of the world\u2019s leading 100 ecommerce websites have mobile sites that load fully in less than five seconds on mobile devices \u2013 and one-fifth take almost eight seconds to load completely, an almost criminally long time for sites that live and die by conversion rate optimization.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-shopping-cart-abandonment.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate reasons for shopping cart abandonment\" width=\"760\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Shopping cart abandonment percentages (Image via Search Engine Journal)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Before you even think of looking at the content of your pages, make sure your visitors can actually view them in a reasonable amount of time.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Make Your Content More Accessible with Smart Formatting<\/h2>\n<p>Ever clicked through to a blog post or web page, only to discover an immense, intimidating wall of text? If so, you already know how discouraging this can be to readers. Even if your content is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/28\/content-marketing-advice\">incredibly valuable and completely unique<\/a>, it won\u2019t matter if your readers are scared off by the prospect of wading into a blog post of equal density as <em>War and Peace<\/em> or <em>Les Mis\u00e9rables<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-les-miserables-thickness.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate Les Miserables thickness\" width=\"450\" height=\"357\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Some blog posts read a bit too much like this; and as such, are formidable<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Formatting your pages to be as welcoming and accessible as possible is one of the best ways to reduce your bounce rate. The less \u201cwork\u201d a visitor has to do to get what they want, the more likely they are to stick around. Don\u2019t overwhelm your visitors with weighty paragraphs that span entire pages, and make use of white space to make your content more approachable.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways to make content less visually intimidating:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appropriate use of headers<\/li>\n<li>Frequent subheadings<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/01\/content-marketing-images\">Suitable images<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Bulleted lists (see what I did there?)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use of these formatting options makes your content more accessible and allows the reader to scan or skim your content quickly to identify points that are most relevant to their needs.<\/p>\n<p>That said, don\u2019t insult your readers\u2019 intelligence, either. Trust your audience to know what they need, then give it to them. I\u2019ve seen blogs that, while offering useful information, insist on using a line break or including an image between every single sentence, which can be just as annoying as huge walls of text.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Use Sidebar Widgets and Promotions Sparingly<\/h2>\n<p>Some web pages are an ideal vehicle for offering relevant content, offers, and other material to your audience. Blog pages are a prime example, and you\u2019d probably struggle to find a decent blog without something in the sidebar. However, cramming the digital margins of your content with ads, offers, award emblems, and other crap is a surefire way to overwhelm your visitor and tempt them to bounce.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-website-widgets.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate website widgets\" width=\"550\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Sidebars widgets and promotions can be overwhelming<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want to highlight relevant content from your sidebar, do so in a way that offers the reader additional value. For example, related article recommendations that expand upon the topic covered in a blog post is a great way to make your site \u201cstickier\u201d as well as provide genuinely valuable and useful content to your readers. Similarly, if you choose to include <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">awards and trust signals<\/a> in your sidebar, make sure they\u2019re from only the most reputable and renowned sources so that they serve an actual purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Also, be wary of the type of pop-ups offered by services such as Bounce Exchange. These promotions can be highly effective, but they can also be terribly distracting, especially if you set them to appear the moment a user visits a page. Give your visitors enough time to immerse themselves in your content before pouncing on them with newsletter sign-up offers or other promotions. Don\u2019t push too hard, too fast.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Cross-Reference Bounce Rate with Time on Site<\/h2>\n<p>As the old saying goes, \u201cNo metric is an island\u201d (or something), and taking bounce rate data out of context can be as dangerous as relying on it exclusively as an indicator of your site\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to look at your bounce rate within the wider context of your site in general. Doing so allows you to ascertain more accurately whether the problem is with a specific page, a type of page (such as your site\u2019s blog or product pages), or your site as a whole. If your Time on Site metrics are decent, but your blog pages have a high bounce rate, the problem may be with your content. On the other hand, if your bounce rate is high and Time on Site is low, you may not be giving visitors what they want in a more general sense.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-time-on-site.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate Google Time on Site calculation\" width=\"537\" height=\"372\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Read more on Analytics\u2019 Time on Site metric in <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/cutroni.com\/blog\/2012\/02\/29\/understanding-google-analytics-time-calculations\/\"><em>this excellent<br \/>\npost by Google\u2019s Justin Cutroni<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As with any metric, be sure to investigate usage trends with wider site data to make sure you\u2019re not dealing with an anomalous outlier of a page when making decisions that will affect your whole site, or that you\u2019re not missing a larger problem by focusing too narrowly on the details.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Ruthlessly Optimize for Relevance<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from technical considerations like page load times or failing to adhere to formatting best practices, one of the biggest contributing factors to high bounce rates is relevance \u2013 or irrelevance.<\/p>\n<p>Some sites target certain keywords very effectively, only to serve content that is tangentially relevant to that query at best, or downright irrelevant to it at worst. If the page you\u2019re serving isn\u2019t directly relevant to a user\u2019s query, you can almost guarantee that they\u2019re going to bounce. For this reason, it\u2019s vital that you optimize for relevance above all other considerations.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-optimize-for-relevance.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate optimize for relevance\" width=\"1382\" height=\"982\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Relevance is the name of the game in Conversion Rate Optimization<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you decide to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">go after a keyword<\/a>, and end up ranking for it, make sure the content of the page you serve is highly relevant to that query. Consider user intent when targeting keywords. Is the prospect looking to learn something, or buy something? What stage of the funnel are they in? What problem are they trying to solve? These are all questions that can help you provide the most useful, relevant content to your audience, and the more relevant your content is to users\u2019 queries, the more likely they are to stick around once they\u2019ve arrived on your site.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Include a Single, Clear Call to Action<\/h2>\n<p>Just as you should consider what the user wants when serving content (as you should be when optimizing for relevance in tip #5), you should also think about what specific action <em>you<\/em> want users to take when they\u2019ve consumed whatever content you\u2019re offering. Once you know what you want them to do, you can prompt your visitors to take action by including <strong>ONE<\/strong> crystal-clear <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">call to action<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-too-many-ctas.png\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate too many calls to action\" width=\"947\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Call-to-actions like this one leave a lot to be desired<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The more CTAs you include on a single page, the more likely you are to confuse and overwhelm your visitors. Sure, it\u2019d be great if we could include several CTAs on a single page and trust visitors to diligently investigate and evaluate each before taking an action, but let\u2019s face it \u2013 this doesn\u2019t happen very often. Your site should make it effortless for visitors to find \u2013 and do \u2013 what they want to, quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t overwhelm your visitors with dozens of CTAs. Think about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">user intent<\/a> and how your pages can help visitors accomplish their goal, then include a clear, relevant call to action that helps them get the job done.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Use a Logical &#8211; and USEFUL \u2013 Internal Linking Structure<\/h2>\n<p>Many people advocate for including dozens of internal links in your content as a way to reduce your bounce rate. Although this strategy can work well, as it provides Analytics with that essential second click to accurately measure Time on Page, it can also backfire by making your content seem, well, a little sleazy or cheap. We\u2019ve all seen sites that link internally in every other sentence, and not only does this look awful, it doesn\u2019t do much to enrich the user experience or offer audiences something of genuine value.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-too-many-hyperlinks.png\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate too many hyperlinks\" width=\"673\" height=\"216\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A cramped internal linking structure causes all kinds of readability issues<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This principle comes back to relevance. If you have a useful, highly actionable blog post that outlines a specific topic in great depth and would be of interest (and value) to your audience, by all means link to it from other pages. However, don\u2019t go overboard with the internal links. This can confuse and overwhelm your visitors (see above), and can also dissuade visitors from clicking any of the internal links in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing internal links and anchor text, focus on relevance and a logical linking strategy. If you take a look at our guides on <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>, for example, you\u2019ll see that we link to other pages focusing on topics such as bidding in AdWords and click-through rate, because these topics are highly relevant to the topic of Quality Score. It would make much less sense for us to link to articles focused on, say, clickbait or SEO simply because they aren\u2019t relevant to Quality Score.<\/p>\n<p>Resist the temptation to internally link to every article in your archive, and focus on linking to useful articles or pages that are highly relevant and potentially useful to your visitors.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Rework Your Product Pages<\/h2>\n<p>Getting product pages can be tricky. Offer too much information and you risk overwhelming your visitors. Offer too little and your prospects may not feel as though they have enough information to make an informed decision. However, if you spend even a little time looking at product pages, you\u2019ll probably notice several opportunities for optimization that could not only decrease bounce rates, but improve conversion rates.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-product-pages.png\" alt=\"Slick, glossy online product page for razors\" width=\"677\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>How might we rework this page to optimize for conversions?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the major reasons people fail to convert from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/05\/product-landing-pages\">product pages<\/a> is because they aren\u2019t ready to complete a purchase or transaction. Sometimes this is as simple as buyer hesitation or an aversion to price, but sometimes, it\u2019s because the information they want about a product isn\u2019t provided. This could include details on where something was manufactured, the specifics of your return policy, or user reviews.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth remembering that bounce rates from product pages can be a little higher than some other types of page, and that this can vary further depending on the nature of the product or service in question. However, if you\u2019re noticing unusually high bounce rates on your product pages, consider testing whether adding more information helps. Is your return policy clearly stated on your product pages to offset prospects\u2019 risk aversion? Is it clear how and where the product was made? What do your satisfied customers think of your products, and are these rave reviews featured prominently? As always, be sure to A\/B test these variables before committing to any firm decisions.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Make Your Site Easy to Search<\/h2>\n<p>Even in 2016, site search functionality is one aspect of the Web that seems to have remained largely unchanged since the migraine-inducing days of Geocities sites. For whatever reason, site search is considered an afterthought by many websites, representing a huge missed opportunity to provide your visitors with the tools they need to find what they want and reduce your bounce rates.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-geocities.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate Geocities site example\" width=\"736\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Non-navigable means high bounce rate<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Even the most accurate, relevant content recommendations still put the ball firmly in your court in terms of control. Site search, on the other hand, allows visitors to find what they want, not what you <em>think<\/em> they want. If you\u2019ve ever tried to search a site only to be presented with a \u201cPage Not Found\u201d or \u201cNo Results\u201d page for a search query that should have offered dozens of results, you know how needlessly frustrating this can be.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, your site\u2019s search functionality will probably never be as good as Google, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should overlook or ignore it, either. The more easily users can search for and find what they\u2019re looking for, the more likely they are to stick around.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Optimize for Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a little sad that we have to reiterate how important this is, but the number of websites that still aren\u2019t optimized for mobile is breathtaking. With the number of users <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/mobile-marketing\/mobile-marketing-analytics\/mobile-marketing-statistics\/\">accessing the Web primarily from mobile devices increasing every year<\/a>, failing to optimize your site for mobile is practically begging for users to bounce and take their business elsewhere.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-responsive-design.png\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate responsive design\" width=\"1283\" height=\"820\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The world is going mobile. Don&#8217;t just optimize for it. Make it a priority.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, launching a mobile-friendly site is a huge pain in the ass, especially for larger websites. It\u2019s just that simple. It can be a painstaking process, and may be beyond your own technical capabilities, which means it can also be another (considerable) expense for your site or business. However, it\u2019s hard to understate just how crucial mobile optimization is for every type of site, and you should strongly consider making your site mobile friendly, regardless of the time, effort, and expense involved, or the ulcers or sleepless nights you incur in the process.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also vitally important to remember tip #1 when optimizing your site for mobile. It doesn\u2019t matter how pretty your site looks on an iPhone if it takes more than a minute to load.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Make Your Site\u2019s Navigation Effortless<\/h2>\n<p>In the simplest (though perhaps harshest) terms, you can think of your site visitors as lazy, entitled, spoiled little snowflakes that want everything spoon-fed to them with minimal effort. This might not be the most pleasant way to imagine your audience, but let\u2019s be honest \u2013 if you force your users to do even the slightest bit of work to get what they want, they\u2019ll simply go to another site. For this reason, it\u2019s crucial that your site navigation be as effortless as it possibly can be.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-simple-navigation.jpg\" alt=\"Reduce bounce rate simple navigation\" width=\"470\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Effortless, clean site navigation<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Picture a typical browsing session on your site from the perspective of a user. They arrive at your site, and after evaluating your content for a second or two \u2013 and oftentimes that\u2019s literally all the time you have \u2013 they decide that although this page isn\u2019t precisely what they\u2019re looking for, your site could potentially give them what they want. They then attempt to locate the page they are looking for, only to find that your navigation is hidden behind illogical animated drop-down menus, or image links that don\u2019t look like image links, or some similarly atrocious navigational horrors.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think they\u2019ll do next? That\u2019s right \u2013 they\u2019ll bounce faster than one of those neon-pink rubber powerballs you used to get out of gumball machines.<\/p>\n<p>Your site navigation should be clear, immediately understood, and offer the user a seamless experience in getting from one part of your site to another. Visitors shouldn\u2019t have to guess where they are in your site to know how to get around, and they shouldn\u2019t be forced into artificial pathways that you\u2019ve put in place to shepherd them through your sales funnel. Remember \u2013 they\u2019re in control, not you.<\/p>\n<p>Examine your current site navigation and identify opportunities to simplify it. Then simplify it some more. In fact, I challenge you to simplify your site navigation to the point at which it seems almost counterintuitive, because that\u2019s what your visitors want. They don\u2019t care about you, they don\u2019t care about your company \u2013 they only care about themselves and what they want, like the lazy, entitled little snowflakes they are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to reduce your bounce rate?
