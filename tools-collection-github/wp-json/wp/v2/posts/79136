Not only that, but you can also rapidly build authority and credibility for your products by creating high-quality, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/04\/unique-blog-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">authentic content<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>That said, the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls\">Facebook ad<\/a> trend for 2024 is that influencer marketing will be adopted by many more Facebook advertisers, from punchy small businesses to global corporations.<\/p>\n<p><span>Why? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Well, for one thing, influencer marketing is undeniably effective. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/insights\/grow-brand-awareness-and-sales-with-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">84%<\/a> of global consumers say they\u2019d purchase a product based on influencer content, while Facebook campaigns that combine regular ads and influencer ads are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/insights\/grow-brand-awareness-and-sales-with-influencer-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85% more likely<\/a> to drive users to add products to their shopping baskets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, the real key for 2024 is the rise of the micro-influencer.<\/p>\n<p><span>Many brands may previously have dismissed influencer partnerships because they assumed they were too expensive, but micro-influencers enable marketers to enjoy all of the benefits of macro-influencers without the excessive costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Micro-influencers may attract smaller followings, but they\u2019re often highly respected in very specific niches.

Ecommerce will integrate even more closely with Facebook and Instagram<\/h3>\n<p><span>Social media is no longer just about content and communication.

The Facebook algorithm will automatically combine and run different creative elements (e.g. images, videos, CTAs) to see which assets perform best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s not just about optimizing your Facebook ads to maximize conversions. It\u2019s about delivering personalization at scale.<\/p>\n<p><span>Rather than launching generic ads and hoping for the best, you can automatically tailor your assets to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-targeting\">target audience<\/a> based on their interests and behaviors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example, let\u2019s say a user has recently viewed a specific product on your website. By dynamically retargeting them with this exact product (and similar recommendations) you dramatically increase the relevance of your ads and the likelihood of a conversion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is a fantastic way to scale up your Facebook ad campaigns while maintaining efficiency, so be sure to leverage this strategy next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg\" alt=\"meta ads update - tailored campaigns home page\" width=\"870\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76164 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg 870w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns-480x218.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Use broad audience targeting to fuel the Facebook algorithm<\/h3>\n<p><span>Casting a wide targeting net on Facebook can be a game-changer for the efficiency of your ad campaigns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>This may sound like a pretty simple strategy, but it\u2019s a small tweak that can make a big impact on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics\">conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span>While it\u2019s easy to get carried away with the granular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">targeting options available on Facebook<\/a>, a super-niche audience is more likely to restrict campaign performance than improve it. <\/span><span>That\u2019s because the Facebook algorithm needs sufficient scale to test different audiences, make optimizations, and gather learnings. The more users the platform can reach, the more insights it can gather\u2014and this is crucial for achieving superior ROI. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Instead of narrowing down your Facebook audience too much, try to be patient. Start with broader targeting, allow the learning phase to progress, and give the algorithm the best chance of identifying high-value segments for your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads trends - audience size indicator\" width=\"520\" height=\"349\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"what-facebook-ads-trends-mean\"><\/div>\n<h2>What these Facebook ads trends and tips mean for your business<\/h2>\n<p>The Facebook platform is constantly evolving, and 2024 will undoubtedly bring new challenges, opportunities, and innovations for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p><span>However, by taking note of these trends and utilizing proven Facebook strategies, you can set yourself up for success next year.
