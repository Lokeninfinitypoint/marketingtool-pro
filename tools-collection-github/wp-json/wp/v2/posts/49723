These conditions can be user behaviors, actions, or specific signals on a one-to-one basis. This means that triggered emails are sent to one receiver at a time, as and when the conditions are met, as opposed to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails<\/a> that are usually sent in bulk.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-illustration.png\" width=\"418\" height=\"328\" alt=\"trigger email illustration\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailvendorselection.com\/best-triggered-email-provider\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll go more into these types in a bit, but here are some common trigger emails:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welcome<\/li>\n<li>Onboarding<\/li>\n<li>Order confirmation<\/li>\n<li>Notification<\/li>\n<li>Cart abandonment<\/li>\n<li>Nudge<\/li>\n<li>Re-engagement<\/li>\n<li>Remarketing<\/li>\n<li>Birthday<\/li>\n<li>Milestone<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Triggered emails vs drip emails<\/h2>\n<p>Both types of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">emails use automation<\/a>\u00a0to keep your subscribers, leads, and customers engaged, but in different ways and with different purposes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trigger emails<\/strong> are designed to fire after a specific event or set of conditions, like when someone\u00a0places an order, adds to their cart but doesn&#8217;t purchase within two days, or if they reach a particular milestone.\u00a0The email is tied specifically to that event and individual, and the goal is not always marketing-related. You can set trigger emails to fire if someone has an appointment coming up, if there is a suspicious sign-on, or if they&#8217;ve reached a quota.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drip emails<\/strong>, on the other hand, are a series of emails set to fire in a chronological order. So if someone downloads a guide, you might enter them into a drip campaign where they get an email every two weeks promoting a different guide. The sends are not dependent on the user&#8217;s actions.

Welcome emails<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">Welcome emails<\/a> are sent after someone registers with your business, becomes a customer, or\u00a0signs up for your email list. These emails often thank the person for joining, provide\u00a0brief rundown of what to expect as a member, and then share links to resources or perhaps the promo code or coupon they promised in their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/23\/pop-up-advertising\">popup<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-examples-casper-welcome-email.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"892\" alt=\"trigger email example: welcmoe\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getvero.com\/resources\/welcome-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3><strong>2. Onboarding emails<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>These emails are similar to welcome emails, but are mainly for platforms or services where the user may need some assistance getting started, or if there are necessary steps to take to complete the account creation process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-example-printful.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click to see full email.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-example-printful.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"554\" alt=\"trigger email example: onboarding\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/welcome-to-printful-really-good-emails-shop-integration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Order confirmation emails<\/h3>\n<p>These emails are triggered after a purchase is completed, and typically contain the receipt information, delivery details, and a link to track shipping. Oftentimes, a separate trigger email sends once the item is shipped.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-examples-order-confirmation.jpeg\" width=\"460\" height=\"1155\" alt=\"trigger email example: order confirmation\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartrmail.com\/blog\/well-crafted-order-confirmation-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Notification\u00a0emails<\/h3>\n<p>These\u00a0are not <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails<\/a>, but instead\u00a0provide important information related to the person&#8217;s account. There isn&#8217;t usually a<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\"> call to action<\/a> in there other than to take any necessary action.

Cart abandonment emails<\/h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most common trigger email, this one gets sent out if a customer adds items to their digital cart\u00a0but does not complete the checkout process. These emails usually get triggered after a certain amount of time has elapsed with no purchase.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-email-examples-cart-abandonment-funny.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"864\" alt=\"trigger email example: cart abandonment\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/don-t-let-free-shipping-go-to-waste\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6.

Re-engagement emails<\/h3>\n<p>This is a re-engagement strategy, and these emails are sent as timely reminders to dormant subscribers who have not purchased from you or engaged with your product for a while.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-emails-reengagement-example.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"547\" alt=\"trigger email example: reengagement\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/we-miss-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>\u00a08. Remarketing emails<\/h3>\n<p>These emails are aimed at getting a segment of your email list to take further action after a particular engagement. For example, you might set an email up to send out to webinar attendees after the event, encouraging them to book a consult or look at additional resource.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/trigger-emails-examples-hive.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"680\" alt=\"trigger email example: remarketing email\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/thanks-for-attending-our-ecommerce-email-marketing-webinar-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>9. Birthday emails<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/happy-birthday-email-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Birthday emails<\/a> don&#8217;t need a definition! But they are used to help make your customers feel valued.

Here are some key <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email marketing best practices <\/a>to apply to your trigger campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Capture relevant data<\/h3>\n<p>What type of data should you collect from new signups that would help you to better segment subscribers\/prospects\/customers? The right data sets will help youto curate the best performing emails. Key demographic factors to consider here include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gender<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Engagement and activity<\/li>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Parental status<\/li>\n<li>Work status<\/li>\n<li>Work title and rank<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Use personalization techniques<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.activetrail.com\/marketing_blog\/marketing_automation_articles\/amazing-email-personalization-statistics-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Research<\/a> suggests that 63% of Millennials, 58% of Gen X users, and 46% of Baby Boomers are comfortable with sharing personal information in exchange for personalized offers and discounts.<\/p>\n<p>Use the data collected in the first step to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize<\/a> your emails. This is one of our top\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/25\/email-copywriting-tips\">email copywriting tips<\/a>.\u00a0Address\u00a0customers on a first-name basis, use data from their life cycle stage, or the products or services they are interested in.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Track website visitor behavior<\/h3>\n<p>Synchronize your website visitors\u2019 behavioral data (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">learn some metrics to consider here<\/a>)\u00a0with your campaign&#8217;s\u00a0offer. For instance, you may find that a particular reader might have stayed on a landing page for quite some time. Based on their engagement heat map of the page, the best decision would be to set up a customized remarketing email for such readers containing a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">special promotion or offer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Set campaign goals<\/h3>\n<p>What action do you want your reader to take? Make a purchase? Visit landing page? Check out your latest blog post? Have\u00a0one goal for every campaign so that your message is clear and targeted. It is always better to have fewer and specific actions that subscribers are willing to take rather than multiple goals that end up overwhelming them altogether.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Monitor results and pivot strategies<\/h3>\n<p>It is important to check the metrics of your campaigns as soon as they are off the ground. Otherwise, you will not be able to track results or pivot your email strategies to seek better results. You need to check for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The open rate of your emails (which you can improve with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">awesome subject lines<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Click through rate for the call to action.<\/li>\n<li>Unsubscribe rate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These numbers will help you to measure the effectiveness of your offer,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-copywriting-tips\/\">email copy<\/a>, headline, and more.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep your customers engaged with trigger emails<\/h2>\n<p>This blog was aimed to take a quick look at the theory behind triggered emails.
