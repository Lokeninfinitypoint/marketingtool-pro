To them, the transition from expanded text ads (ETAs) to RSAs is almost an existential threat, so they&#8217;ll do everything they can to regain that control.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, they&#8217;ll simulate an ETA with their RSA by providing only three headlines and only two descriptions and pinning them all.

If there are other categories that make sense for your specific industry, add them in there as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #2: Assemble categories into themed templates<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we have some headlines, we need to decide where they\u2019re going to go. But before we choose specific headlines for each RSA, we\u2019re going to outline a template for the RSA as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples you could run with\u2014again, focusing only on headlines at the moment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template.png\" alt=\"responsive search ad headlines - template\" width=\"720\" height=\"165\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59787\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template-480x110.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><em>Link to the template is above.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Each headline matches a category that you have already written a number of headlines for, but the idea here is to map out overall message flow.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Don\u2019t forget, headline position #3 doesn\u2019t always show for each impression, so this portion of the messaging shouldn\u2019t be something imperative for every impression.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Step #3: Add messaging &amp; pin into your template<\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to put your money where your mouth is. When you create your RSA, choose the template you\u2019re going to use and add in the headlines from each category, then pin them into the templated spot.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-headline-examples.png\" alt=\"responsive search ad headline examples\" width=\"546\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59789\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-headline-examples.png 546w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-headline-examples-480x492.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For this example, I used Template #1 from Step #2 to create my ad, which is:<\/p>\n<p><em>Keyword focused &#8211; Call to action &#8211; Price comparison<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Each headline that is keyword-focused is pinned into Headline position #1, calls to action are in Headline position #2, and price comparisons are pinned in Headline position #3.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see above, you can pin multiple components into the same placement, but the key here is to make sure you pin appropriately.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you pin at least one headline into all three headline placements, then leave other headlines unpinned, those unpinned headlines <strong>will not be used.<\/strong> So to employ this strategy appropriately, pin every headline.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Step #4: Follow a similar 3-step process for descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Clearly, headlines are not the only components for RSAs. Conduct a similar practice of theme generation and content writing for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/18\/create-winner-text-ad-description\">descriptions<\/a> and add them to your headline templates to create an entirely cohesive ad variant.<\/p>\n<p>Some tips for description writing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try not to duplicate the language used in headlines. This is simply not strategic.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to include calls to action in some variants.<\/li>\n<li>Description 2 won\u2019t always show, so be sure you\u2019re writing copy that isn\u2019t reliant on that variable to make sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some description examples for the fictional ad we&#8217;re building:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want to make paid advertising more accessible to everyone.

It has headlines and descriptions that fit an overall template to where you can control the user experience with your brand but also allow Google to choose the specific messaging based on its \u201cintuition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time for you to test, just like you would have with Expanded Text Ads. (If you think you don&#8217;t need to test your ads, read my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/07\/google-ads-mistakes\">Google Ads mistakes<\/a> post and let me change your mind.) Here are some samples of tests you can run:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Test templates against each other.<\/strong> What types of messages work best in which places?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test within templates.<\/strong> Create 3 different RSAs and use the strategy outlined above for all but one component. Use each RSA to test a singular aspect of that ad to see how each does.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test themes of messaging within the same template.<\/strong> Maybe you test Template 2, but you make one variant that is all risk aversion messaging while the other is positive messaging.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At this point, your ad copy test is like a choose-your-own-adventure book.<\/p>\n<h2>Be the Calculated Practitioner<\/h2>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not a huge fan of responsive search ads or you\u2019re still chapped at having your control taken away, the fact of the matter is RSAs are here to stay. I\u2019m not a huge fan of losing control within my ad campaigns, but I\u2019m also not so averse to automation, and I don\u2019t think you should be either.<\/p>\n<p>So, while the Control Freaks are still fuming over the upcoming changes and the Hot Messes are oblivious to what\u2019s about to happen to them, be the Calculated Practitioner. Get your testing house in order, have a strategy to make the most of this change, and leave your competition in the dust.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get the most of what RSAs
