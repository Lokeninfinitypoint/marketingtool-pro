In traditional fashion, let\u2019s start with the bad news.<\/p>\n<p>By almost every metric, businesses with big budgets are doing better in Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords)\u00a0than lower spenders. Maybe not surprising, but it still hurts. The rich get richer while us little guys get left in the dust.<\/p>\n<p>How do we know? We looked at 18,037 reports from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> and compared performance between advertisers spending more than $50K a month and everyone else. And big spenders really came out ahead.<\/p>\n<p>But wait! Don\u2019t leave in despair just yet. The truth is, you can emulate a lot of what those bigger advertisers with deeper pockets are doing, <em>without<\/em> spending more money. <strong>In Google Ads, success is often just a matter of getting more active and actually <em>doing<\/em> more stuff in your account!<\/strong> This is your good news.<\/p>\n<p>Big spenders know this because there\u2019s so much money on the line, they can\u2019t afford to mess around. They can\u2019t half-ass it or leave their account untouched for a month. Instead, they stay on top of their performance and make optimizations every week.<\/p>\n<p>You can do that too \u2013 and get WAY better results, without just pouring more budget into your account.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll show you <strong>the top nine things that big AdWords spenders are doing that you\u2019re not<\/strong>, so you can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-compete-in-google-ads\"> compete with the big guys even on a smaller budget<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Big Spenders ALWAYS Use Conversion Tracking<\/h2>\n<p>We think it\u2019s crazy that anyone spending money in Google Ads\u00a0wouldn\u2019t enable conversion tracking, but it does happen.<\/p>\n<p>Not to big spenders though.<\/p>\n<p>Fully 100% of advertisers spending more than $50K per month have conversion tracking on. Because OF COURSE they do!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not seeing your conversion volume creep up and to the right, how on Earth can you be expected to optimize for success? A 75% CTR sounds great, but if you can\u2019t tie all those clicks back to conversions, you\u2019re burning cash.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3f2cb4e7-b0a2-4b31-b3fd-230c08fa481e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/conversion_tracking_usage_adwords_budget.png\" alt=\"conversion tracking by adwords spend\" width=\"850\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Luckily, most advertisers realize they need to track conversions in some fashion, and that\u2019s reflected in our data. Only 7% of the lower spenders don\u2019t have conversion tracking enabled. But there\u2019s no reason both numbers couldn\u2019t be 100%.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re spending less money on Google Ads than Coca-Cola, you should care about ROI.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">Getting conversion tracking set up on your website is relatively simple<\/a> and completely free (unless you need a developer\u2019s assistance, in which case it\u2019ll cost you a bit but it\u2019s still more than worth it)! That $500 or $10,000 or however much you\u2019re spending on AdWords ads each month can significantly impact your business. Learning how and why is paramount to your success in Google Ads. That starts with conversion tracking.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Big Spenders Have More Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p>Even with conversion tracking enabled and a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">structurally sound account<\/a> in place, there\u2019s a factor outside of Google Ads\u00a0that can have a profound impact on performance. I\u2019m talking about those action-inducing corners of your website to which you send paid traffic. I\u2019m talking, of course, about landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Big-budget advertisers know that if you have multiple ads and multiple offers, you need multiple landing pages too. That\u2019s because your prospects will respond much better to specific, tailored messaging that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/16\/landing-page-message-match\">matches the ad they clicked very closely<\/a>. If you\u2019re sending all your traffic to one generic landing page (or worse, your home page!) they\u2019re going to get confused and bounce.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"424d333a-569c-4647-a0c8-55613e53341b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/number_landing_pages_by_adwords_budget-1.png\" alt=\"how many adwords landing pages should I have\" width=\"850\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>More than 1 in 4 (26%) of lower-budget Google Ads accounts only have a single active landing page, compared to just 4% of top-spending accounts.<\/p>\n<p>You need to fix this!<\/p>\n<p>We know the challenge here. When you\u2019re small, you don\u2019t have a fleet of designers and developers at the ready to build new landing pages at the drop of a hat.<\/p>\n<p>But at the very least, you can duplicate your current design and begin <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/07\/landing-page-test-ideas\">testing images and copy<\/a>. If your Google Ads campaigns are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">built out logically<\/a> and you\u2019re currently using a single landing page across your whole account, make a duplicate version for each campaign.<\/p>\n<p>This will allow you to optimize the language on each page for the subset of keywords you\u2019re bidding on, improving relevance for both the user and the Quality Score algorithm (in an ideal world, you can do this ad the ad group level. But hey, I know you\u2019re busy).<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of which direction you take your landing page testing in, make sure there\u2019s more than one! If you need any more proof that this is crucial to compete with the big guys, take a look at our next graph\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>#3. On Average, Big Spenders Have a 17% Higher Conversion Rate<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1da8864b-62a2-4c09-b45a-8e581402ebd4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/average_adwords_conversion_rate_by_budget.png\" alt=\"average conversion rate by adwords spend\" width=\"700\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">average click-to-conversion rate<\/a> of our top-spender accounts is 10.5%; in lower-spending accounts, the average conversion rate is 9.0%.<\/p>\n<p>That may not sound like a big difference, but it means the money guys are getting 17% more conversions out of the same number of clicks, without having to spend more for more clicks.<\/p>\n<p>How are they doing it?<\/p>\n<p>Well, see above. Part of the reason that big spenders have more landing pages is because they prioritize conversion rate optimization.<\/p>\n<p>When you start considering CRO, it\u2019s tempting to skip right to your landing pages (if you have more than one!) and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">start fiddling with button colors and graphic elements<\/a>. Don\u2019t do that. Or, rather, do that later. But start at the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure the keywords you\u2019re bidding on relate to your business. Broad terms might bring in a ton of traffic, but paying for superfluous clicks is a waste of your budget. We recommend <a href=\"\/how-to-use-google-adwords\">allocating more than half of your budget<\/a> to high-intent, top-converting keywords.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to make sure that the offers you\u2019re pointing people to are truly compelling. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">A better offer can raise your conversion rates<\/a> much more than a better button.<\/p>\n<p>Once it comes time to address <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/17\/more-landing-page-conversions\">your landing pages<\/a>, your goal should be to ensure a positive, useful, and <em>speedy<\/em> experience for visitors. You can do this by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing compelling <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">headlines<\/a> (just like your ads!)<\/li>\n<li>Using concise, targeted body copy<\/li>\n<li>Testing to uncover the most eye-catching, enticing CTA for your offer<\/li>\n<li>Designing a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/27\/landing-page-forms\">user-friendly form<\/a> (making the journey from ad to purchase as frictionless as possible)<\/li>\n<li>A fast-loading, mobile-friendly design<\/li>\n<li>Advanced class: Try to affect your readers <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/01\/high-converting-landing-page-images\">on an emotional level<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that everything you can do to bolster conversion rates in your account has already been mentioned elsewhere in this post.

Big Spenders Are Using More Ad Extensions (4,631% More)<\/h2>\n<p>What if I told you there\u2019s an extremely easy, totally FREE way to raise the CTR of your ads without even having to get creative?<\/p>\n<p>That method is ad extensions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"891cf89d-bb2d-4da8-b770-8462655075ab\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/big_spenders_adwords_ad_extensions.png\" alt=\"total ad extensions by adwords budget\" width=\"700\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Where top-spenders have an average of 31 ad extensions for every text ad in their accounts, low-spenders tend to operate at a one-to-one ratio.<\/p>\n<p>Framed another way, there were <em>4,631% more <\/em>ad extensions in the set of 450 top-spending accounts we analyzed than in the 17,587 low-spending accounts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"be885465-004c-47e4-a301-d3a6bcedf13f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/big_spenders_ad_extensions_adoption-2.png\" alt=\"ad extensions in high spend adwords accounts\" width=\"850\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Further, top spenders have extensions enabled on about half of their ads (48%), while the lower spenders only have extensions enabled on 17% of their ads, leaving 83% of their ads extensionless.<\/p>\n<p>Yikes.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to PPC ads, size matters, and these top spenders know that you can use every ad extension in the book to make your Expanded Text Ads big enough to blot out the sun (or at least the rest of the <a href=\"\/serp\">SERP<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Provided your ads are served in the top three positions, there are a dozen extensions you can use to increase both value and ad real estate (and that doesn\u2019t even include the automated extensions Google\u2019s wont to sling your way just because it\u2019s a Wednesday afternoon).<\/p>\n<p>We get it. If you\u2019re a one-man-band, routine optimization and writing ads is time-consuming enough; worrying about optional ad extensions probably feels like a waste of time.<\/p>\n<p>I assure you, it isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Depending which one\u2019s served, ad extensions have the chance to <strong>improve your CTR <em>six-fold.<\/em><\/strong> Why?

Big Spenders Add (a Lot) More Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Negative keywords are the offensive line of any high-functioning Google Ads account: you know they\u2019re there, but you only really think about them when something\u2019s their fault.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re bidding on the perfect keywords (high intent! relevant! volumetrically salient!) but you can\u2019t seem to earn a conversion to save your life, it\u2019s probably not because your prospects don\u2019t like you.

As such, many advertisers opted to rotate their top performing standard ad against a new ETA. When the STA inevitably outperformed the ETA (thanks, historical data!), advertisers paused the big, shiny ETA . Hell, we did this in our own account: Why ostensibly waste ad spend?<\/p>\n<p>These tests were misleading, though. Really misleading. Eventually, those still leaning on shorter ads are going to be left in the dust. If maximizing SERP real estate with ad extensions is recommended, doing so with your ad copy alone should be <em>required.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As usual, the disparity probably stems from larger advertisers having the resources to continue testing new ads and smaller advertisers, well, not. While top-spenders have spent the better part of a year replacing old ads with new ones and removing even top-performing standard ads from their ad rotation, smaller advertisers are lagging behind.<\/p>\n<p>The solution? Simple.<\/p>\n<p>Taker everything you\u2019ve learned from this post so far and use it to roll out a wave of killer Expanded Text Ads.

I mean, it\u2019s a valuable metric that, despite countless think pieces, is still shrouded in secrecy. What we <em>do<\/em> know about QS is that it can significantly impact your CPC.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c4b1aae8-d4c4-4d2a-9018-29bef2df3245\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png\" alt=\"how quality score impacts cost per click\" width=\"720\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads-480x357.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As you can see, Quality Score can drastically raise or reduce your average CPC.<\/p>\n<p>A perfect Quality Score can discount your CPC by about 50%; a heinous Quality Score can increase costs by 400%. At that point, you\u2019re either bidding on the wrong keywords or there\u2019s some serious work to be done on your ads and landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Impression-weighted Quality Score is a variation on the QS metric that\u2019s available to you in Google Ads. The difference is straightforward: it adjusts for the number of impressions (shocking, I know), giving you some much needed context. Impression-weighted Quality score isn\u2019t a KPI, per se, but it is an indicator of health. Like a Google Ads\u00a0thermometer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7c143c4d-e204-4d72-8192-e6183865298f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords_quality_score_average_by_budget.png\" alt=\"adwords quality score by budget level\" width=\"700\" height=\"650\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>According to our new research, top-spenders have an average impression-weighted Quality Score of 6.3, where low-spenders average just 5.6.<\/p>\n<p>That 12% difference might not sound like much, but in reality, it represents unneeded budget inefficiency that small businesses simply cannot sustain. If you\u2019ve got a lower budget, you need to do everything in your power to make sure you\u2019re spending it efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>To determine the impression-weighted Quality Score of a given ad group or campaign use the following formula:<\/p>\n<p><strong>(Impressions * Quality Score) \/ Impressions \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got a handle on your impression-weighted Quality Score, it\u2019s time to pull some levers to improve it. The factors that impact Quality Score the most are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>That <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/11\/average-click-through-rate\">all-important CTR<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Ad relevance<\/li>\n<li>Landing page experience<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These should all look familiar.<\/p>\n<p>Again, improving ad copy and landing page quality are the most direct ways to close the gap between the average joe and the multi-national conglomerate (at least when it comes to Google Ads).<\/p>\n<h2>#9. Big Spenders Take More Actions in Their Accounts<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a>, here\u2019s a little primer: It\u2019s a free tool that runs a quick audit on your Google Ads account, checking for many of the best practices outlined above (Quality Score, negative keywords, account activity, etc.) and gives you an overall grade based on your performance.<\/p>\n<p>The Grader also checks for account activity, because in our experience, strong performance correlates highly with doing stuff \u2013 logging into your account and making adjustments for improvement. If you don\u2019t even look at your account for weeks at a time, how are you going to improve anything?<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, we found that the $50K-and-up crowd aren\u2019t just spending more money in their accounts; they\u2019re also spending more time there. Check it out:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"69f250c3-d8eb-47eb-bcda-f76e47535435\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/big_spenders_adwords_actions_recent.png\" alt=\"adwords actions last 30 days\" width=\"700\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The big spenders group is WAY more active \u2013 1196% more active. They\u2019re getting in there and actually doing all the stuff we talked about above.<\/p>\n<h2>What Does It All Mean?<\/h2>\n<p>Money can\u2019t buy happiness and it can\u2019t buy you a perfect Google Ads\u00a0account.<\/p>\n<p>However, with great budgets comes great responsibility. Businesses that <a href=\"\/articles\/google-earnings\">spend a lot on their online advertising<\/a> take their account performance very seriously, so they invest <strong>time and attention<\/strong> in their accounts, not just money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Even if you can\u2019t raise your budget significantly, you can make like a big spender and commit to more activity in your account:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/keywords\">adding new keywords<\/a> and negative keywords, testing new ads, building dedicated landing pages, enabling every ad extension under the sun.<\/p>\n<p>We promise, if you spend a month or two working diligently on your account, without spending a penny more, you\u2019ll see your own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Grader<\/a> score go up too.<\/p>\n<h3>Data Sources<\/h3>\n<p>We pulled all the data collected from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> reports in the last quarter (Q2 2017), excluding duplicate reports from users who had previously run a report and users with $0 in spend.
