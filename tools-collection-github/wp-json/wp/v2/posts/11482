That means you have more cash leaving your business\u2014whether that\u2019s through paychecks, rent payments, paid marketing campaigns, and other fixed or variable costs\u2014than you have coming in. That\u2019s a problem, but it\u2019s not a unique one.

Reduce costs as much as possible<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re a small business owner, rethinking your business finances was probably one of the first things you did in March after ensuring your team was safe. If you applied for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/01\/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program\">PPP loan<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, you\u2019ve recently reviewed your financials in a level of detail that many of us don\u2019t reach outside of tax season. But even if you have, you\u2019ll want to continually re-examine your financials for the time being. And if you haven\u2019t tackled this yet\u2014or you\u2019re taking this on for the first time due to downsizing here are some tasks you\u2019ll want to check off your list right away.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>List all your fixed and variable costs to start cuts<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First, in case it\u2019s helpful, let\u2019s review the definitions of <strong>fixed <\/strong>versus <strong>variable costs<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"df9af167-5502-4007-9ad2-7532fcc93242\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-cash-flow-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg\" alt=\"fixed vs. variable costs\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Depending on your business model and industry, it\u2019s frequently <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/global\/Documents\/About-Deloitte\/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf\">easier to cut variable costs than it is fixed costs<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, so tackle those first. Can you find an alternate, less expensive way to ship your products? Can you temporarily cut your sales personnel\u2019s commission and incentivize them in a different way? But also think through how you can actually change fixed costs into variable ones. When all else fails, try following in the footsteps of one entrepreneur, Brad Emerson, and cut literally anything you don\u2019t need. During the Great Recession, he cut not only maintenance and computer costs, but also <a href=\"https:\/\/thehustle.co\/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19\/\">air conditioning<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. If there\u2019s a time to practice running a lean business, it\u2019s now. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If this process of reviewing line items and determining where to make cuts is new to you, the <a href=\"http:\/\/sbacomplete.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/SBA-Cash-Flow-Template.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SBA\u2019s free worksheet<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/calculators\/breakeven.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Entrepreneur\u2019s break-even calculator<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> can help you get started.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Ask for help\u2014and when you do, be human<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Our economy is an ecosystem; the people and entities that you buy supplies or rent property from depend on your business, so helping to preserve your business solvency is in their best interest. So, for example, if your business is going to have trouble paying rent, have a frank, virtual face-to-face with your landlord as soon as possible. When you do, be sure to be totally honest about what you really need<em> right now <\/em>versus the assistance you anticipate needing in the future. If you really can afford to pay your rent right now, but anticipate struggling in two months, don\u2019t burn your bridges by asking for a pass on your rent this month. Letting your landlord help other, more immediately needy tenants this month\u2014and saving them a ton of stress\u2014you\u2019ll not only preserve your access to the assistance you need when you <em>do <\/em>need it, but also your integrity will only benefit your business for years to come. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Research alternate financing<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Between the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/01\/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program\"> emergency funding provided by the Federal government\u2019s CARES Act<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, grants offered by corporations like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/boost\/grants\">Facebook<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/jason-aten\/google-unveiled-a-massive-stimulus-program-of-its-own-including-340-million-for-small-businesses.html\">Google<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, and donation-driven funds at the local level, there\u2019s more than likely an available funding option that\u2019s well suited for your business. Using a loan to inject cash into your business may seem like taking drastic steps, but it could mean the difference between having to totally rebuild your business during a recession and preserving a strong foundation to work with for the months ahead. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ff216f0a-c9c2-402f-99ce-8d05c8a42810\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-cash-flow-cares-act.jpg\" alt=\"CARES act visualizaton\" width=\"787\" height=\"591\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So explore <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/page\/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the SBA\u2019s catalogue of resources<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and Inc.\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/gabrielle-bienasz\/small-business-grants-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helpful list<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> of small business loan and grant options to brainstorm what might work for you, and contact your local city government to see what programs it\u2019s launched or have planned. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Remember that everyone else is in a tight spot, too<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now\u2019s the time to audit your catalogued invoices for any that are due but remain unpaid\u2014a thankless task when the economy is doing well, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/global\/Documents\/About-Deloitte\/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf\">a thoroughly necessary one now<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. If you haven\u2019t yet, contact any customers or partners who owe you money right away and, again, have a human, empathetic, honest conversation with them. Give them the opportunity to be forthright about their own business situation and needs. If they need the help and you can manage it, consider extending their invoice\u2019s due date. If they don\u2019t need the help, take the opportunity to prompt a timely payment\u2014your balance sheet will thank you. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Prioritize generating cash over turning a profit<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Profit is total sales minus the total cost of producing those goods (your variable costs). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/encyclopedia\/cashflow.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Profit doesn\u2019t equal positive cash flow<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and, remember, what you need right now is <em>cash<\/em>. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8c54396-9bb4-47c8-8829-43abfbd495ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8Ews0fQP_zo?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Refocusing on generating cash can definitely be a mental shift, but if you\u2019ve already tackled the top-priority tasks to strengthen your cash flow (e.g., cutting variable costs), many of your usual profit-generating actions can be adjusted or reprioritized toward the goal of generating cash. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, you\u2019ve probably seen that many brick-and-mortar businesses are currently marketing their e-gift cards. While gift cards aren\u2019t a new revenue stream for many businesses, they\u2019re not usually something you\u2019d put a lot of marketing effort behind, except perhaps as a \u201clast chance\u201d campaign targeting anyone who\u2019s forgotten the next big holiday. But pivoting to focus on gift cards right now is an easy low-cost, low-effort way to get more cash in the door right away\u2014without having to spend cash on the raw materials and other supplies needed to actually create your product or service (i.e., your variable costs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are some more ideas to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Offer exclusive discounts to existing customers<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Acquiring a net new customer is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/encyclopedia\/cashflow.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">always more expensive than driving sales from prior or existing customers<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. In the current market environment\u2014with millions of Americans unemployed and hesitant to spend money, and millions of others are working from home and desperate for distractions\u2014it\u2019ll be harder than ever to convert new business. But if you\u2019re a consumer brand, your existing customers are likely bursting with pent-up demand. If you offer the right discount at the right time with compelling \u201cexclusive\u201d messaging, you\u2019ll likely boost sales, generate cash, and promote customer loyalty. Also, if you sell a physical product, clearing out some of your inventory could help you cut back on rental or storage costs. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Repackage your product or service for a consumer market<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Many products are generally sold to businesses with office space (e.g., office furniture) or that reach consumers via a middleman (e.g., Target)\u2014perhaps yours included! Empower your marketers to whip out their rebranding ideas and pull together a simple landing page to get your product in front of consumers. For example, the team behind <a href=\"https:\/\/home.tryhungry.com\/\">HUNGRY@Home<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> is used to catering corporate events, but these days, they\u2019ve pivoted to cooking and delivering healthy, safe, affordable family-style to people\u2019s homes. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d6e0641-fcd0-4892-b109-cafc786effa7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-cash-flow-hungryathome-example.jpg\" alt=\"Hungry@Home offering from website\" width=\"726\" height=\"323\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">HUNGRY@Home\u2019s offering.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Pivot your offering for better margins<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you can, change your offering to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">new needs of your post-pandemic customers<\/a>. Consider offering products or services that offer high profit margins, economies of scale, and tried-and-true ways to collect payment. Whew! That was a lot. Let\u2019s break that down: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">High profit margin: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Focus on producing products or services that you can charge a high price for, but that cost relatively little to produce. Fortunately, a Zoom subscription is pretty low-cost, so if you can leverage your team\u2019s wide-ranging skills to deliver value virtually, do it. My favorite example so far: The local <a href=\"https:\/\/arthurmurray.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dance studio<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> my husband and I attend is holding classes online (highly recommend!). But it&#8217;s also doing a virtual \u201cDance Mixology\u201d class with one of their teachers to promote a sponsorship campaign. Assuming he already owns bartending gear, and keeping the fixed costs of his salary and a Zoom subscription into account, the only added cost to creating this virtual product is the cost of the ingredients. So why not?<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Economies of scale: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019m seeing lots of restaurants adjusting their menus to focus on family-style meals, similar to HUNGRY@Home, or to a very limited menu. Purchasing supplies or raw materials in bulk is always a great way to save money, so if you can reposition your product offer to accommodate bulk buying of limited supplies, your cash flow will thank you. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Tried-and-true ways of collecting payment: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Remember what we discussed earlier about receivables? Especially if you\u2019re launching a new or adjusted product or service, find ways to collect payment that don\u2019t involve submitting and following up on an invoice. Invest in online checkout so that customers can pay immediately with a credit card <em>before <\/em>you deliver any value, even if the product you\u2019re delivering is digital or virtual. Explore ways to pivot to a subscription model as well; given how cooped up and stressed many of us are these days, chances are that customers who like your product or service will want it again and may appreciate the ease of a subscription. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Find a niche in your neighborhood and fill it<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/enterprise\/cash-flow-management-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> points out, with Amazon prioritizing the delivery of groceries, diapers and infant formula, and personal care items, your local business might find an opportunity to step into that gap by providing faster, contactless delivery for beach reads, summer clothing and gear, home repair equipment, and other non-necessary, but definitely helpful products. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"64444720-c318-494a-a73c-047013ebb536\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-cash-flow-trident.jpg\" alt=\"Trident example\" width=\"723\" height=\"528\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Experiment with offering these products to existing customers at a discount, offering free or discounted delivery, or other offers to discern how to drive the most ongoing local demand while generating the most cash for your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Empower your team with transparency<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We\u2019re all saying it so often these days that it\u2019s already become cliche: \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d We\u2019re saying it, though, because it\u2019s so widely applicable, whether you\u2019re talking about protecting ask-risk neighbors or preserving your small business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As a business leader, now is not the time to hide in your office\u2014or behind your laptop screen at home. It\u2019s time to step up and lead\u2014by empowering your employees to step up as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">How? First, <strong>be transparent about your real business metrics and what you need to achieve<\/strong>. In ordinary times, establishing a business objective that the whole organization can work toward together can generate a shared sense of mission, promote teamwork, and foster individuals\u2019 pride in the business\u2019s accomplishments. It\u2019s natural, though, to hesitate about sharing metrics during a crisis like this, especially if your business goals from the booming start to the year have likely been thrown out the window. But if you <em>are <\/em>open about what needs to happen to keep the business afloat\u2014and about your cash flow goals, in particular\u2014you communicate how much you respect and trust your employees, and you empower them to work together to address those goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9b291d27-4327-4e4c-b8d0-a33a91eac1ce\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-cash-flow-employee-engagement.jpg\" alt=\"Gallup graph of employee engagement\" width=\"552\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Being transparent about metrics and open to new ideas can also boost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vantagecircle.com\/employee-engagement-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">employee engagement<\/a>, which is good for business.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To truly empower your team, you\u2019ll also want to make sure that your employees all understand what the metrics mean. Show your team a P&amp;L and explain how it works. Walk them through a balance sheet. Describe the difference between profit and positive cash flow, and why positive cash flow is the current priority. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But most importantly, make sure each person on your team <strong>understands where they personally drive business impact<\/strong>. As a marketer at a small business, my prior employer created a huge chart of where cash came in and went out; we each wrote our tasks on post-its and took turns placing the post-its on the chart to indicate where and when our everyday work impacted the business. Thanks to this incredibly helpful exercise, we all walked away with a far firmer grasp of how we could each make a difference. Try doing something like this virtually, with a Google doc or other tool. Tell your team to raise their hand immediately if they have an idea to improve cash flow, and emphasize that all ideas are good ideas, and <em>everyone<\/em>\u2019s job is impactful and relevant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By taking the time to educate and empower your team, you\u2019ll invest deeply in your team\u2019s resilience and make huge strides toward unleashing their creativity and motivation to address your business\u2019s challenges. Because we really are all in this together. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Managing your cash flow isn\u2019t new<span lang=\"EN\">\u2014and that\u2019s good news<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whether or not this particular economic crisis is your first rodeo, this is far from the first time that small businesses like yours have faced this level of uncertainty. As it so happens, we experienced one pretty recently\u2014and the lessons learned in 2008, whether about cash flow management or any other business or leadership skill, are still incredibly valid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So as you work on improving cash flow with these tips, keep in mind what worked before\u2014and listen to your colleagues or your business partners about their experiences. Reach out to small business owners and entrepreneurs in your network, and ask them what they did in 2008. Read about <a href=\"https:\/\/thehustle.co\/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19\/\">the experiences of Brad Emerson<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> and so many others. Research not just how businesses in your industry responded, but how your partners\u2019 industries and verticals made their way. You can even get your whole team involved: In a shared place, document what you find, both what worked and what didn\u2019t work. Review your findings together, and discuss how they support or undermine your potential path forward. The solution to your cash flow struggles could be unlocked just by asking a fellow small business owner a few questions.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Managing your cash flow is always a challenge for small businesses, and it&#8217;s more important than ever to work on this.
