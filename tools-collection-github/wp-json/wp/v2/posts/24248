Seven years ago when I ran my one and only Google PPC campaign (a profitable one), I really didn\u2019t enjoy writing <a href=\"\/google-ads\">Google pay-per-click ads<\/a>. I hated counting the letters in the ads to meet Google\u2019s criteria.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ad line #1: 25 characters.<\/li>\n<li>Ad line #2: 35 characters.<\/li>\n<li>Ad line #3: 35 characters.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I wrote the ads on scraps of paper when I had creative flashes. Naturally I lost some of the slips of paper and started using Microsoft Word. That\u2019s how I wrote <a href=\"\/google-ppc\">Google PPC<\/a> ads seven years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Too late I realized I could have used Excel to write my Google PPC ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8b826898-04d0-43eb-a62c-6a553e8c282f\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ad-writing-tool.jpg\" alt=\"Ad Writing Tool\" width=\"435\" height=\"269\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Whenever I type a new ad line or revise one, Excel calculates the number of characters in the ad line and tells me if it\u2019s too long. If the length of the ad is OK, there\u2019s no warning.<\/p>\n<p>In column B I used an =LEN formula and in column C I used an =IF formula. Some people love Excel, some hate it, and some tolerate it. If you love Excel you can build your own spreadsheet like the one shown above.\u00a0 If you\u2019d rather use my spreadsheet, you can visit my Excel site to download my\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/yourexcelcoach.com\/google-adwords-campaign-spreadsheet\/\">Google AdWords campaign spreadsheet<\/a>, which includes the PPC ad writing tool.<\/p>\n<h2>Hard Stuff \u2013 Estimating Profit\/Loss for Google PPC<\/h2>\n<p>Starting a Google AdWords campaign without estimating the profit\/loss of a test campaign is foolish. You absolutely need an Excel spreadsheet to make estimates.<\/p>\n<p>Seven years ago I sold an ebook in 40 countries on how to use Excel. Years ago, my average CPC was 8 cents. Google\u2019s Traffic Estimator tool now estimates that a click will cost me 75 cents. But absolutely no one is advertising for my chosen keywords so I\u2019m hoping Google\u2019s estimate is wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Shown below, the colored cells are the most important to me.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Baseprice<\/strong> \u2013 I\u2019m selling a product at $20 that I hope people will renew on monthly. That\u2019s why cell B7 is $20 and C7 is $60.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost per Click<\/strong> \u2013 Even though Google estimates my CPC at 75 cents, I hope they\u2019re wrong. If the <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> is 25 cents, my test campaign has a chance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Daily Budget<\/strong> \u2013 I\u2019m willing to wager $20 a day for a few days to test the campaign. If it can sell profitably as a test campaign, I\u2019ll advertise as much as I can up to $100 per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rate<\/strong> \u2013 Years ago I converted at between 1 and 1.25%. It was an ugly little website that had no stickiness. All it had was a sales page that was done by me. Now that I know WordPress I\u2019ve built a website that has value where there\u2019s a greater chance a visitor will stick around and join my email opt-in list. Hope so.\u00a0 If it can just sell profitably, I\u2019ll get a professional copywriter for my landing page(s).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Daily net <\/strong>\u2013 Green is for money. Currently I estimate the test campaign will break even. If it breaks even, I have a chance to alter it and make a profit.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Will it run at a profit? Column B is a breakeven analysis. Column C is the blue sky analysis where my wife is shocked with income magically appearing in our checking account via PayPal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"252cd900-5c45-4433-890e-95f19871d3a2\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ppc-campaign-estimator.jpg\" alt=\"Campaign Estimator Tool\" width=\"410\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If my new ebook and Google AdWords marketing is just 1\/3 as successful as my Column C, you\u2019ll hear shouts of joy from Chicago, IL, USA.<\/p>\n<p>If you know Excel, reverse engineering my spreadsheet above won\u2019t be hard. If you\u2019d rather use mine, you can download my Google AdWords campaign spreadsheet here.<\/p>\n<h3>Profit Complications<\/h3>\n<p>My Google AdWords PPC spreadsheet is for selling an ebook. My only cost was Google AdWords. If you\u2019re selling new garages your estimates will be different. As a business owner with a team of garage builders sitting idly by, you have different costs to add to your spreadsheet. If you\u2019re thinking of outsourcing a Google AdWords campaign to someone, then you need to add that cost structure to your spreadsheet. Google AdWords experts don\u2019t work for free.<\/p>\n<h2>Google AdWords and Excel Are Like Peas and Carrots<\/h2>\n<p>Isn\u2019t that the line from Forrest Gump? He and his girlfriend were like \u201cpeas and carrots.\u201d If someone is advertising profitably with Google AdWords, somewhere there\u2019s an Excel spreadsheet keeping score.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank Elisa Gabbert and the nice people at WordStream for helping me with this blog post.
