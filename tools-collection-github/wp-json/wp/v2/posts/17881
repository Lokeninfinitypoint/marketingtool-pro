Over the past few years the company has invested great effort into its advertising arms race against Google, resulting in the expansion of Facebook\u2019s advertising placements.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll discuss what Facebook\u2019s various ad placements are, how they differ, and how you can strategically optimize each one to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-competitive-advertising\">lay the smackdown on your competition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Ad Placement Options<\/h2>\n<p>If you were to start a <a href=\"\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\">Facebook advertising<\/a> account from scratch today, you would quickly realize that your ads are set to run on \u201cautomatic placements\u201d and wonder what that means.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placement-options.png\" alt=\"facebook ad placement options automatic vs edit\" width=\"800\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re anywhere near as cynical as me, you\u2019ll quickly jump to the conclusion that \u201c(Recommended)\u201d means that Facebook wants you to spend more money. You wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong in that assumption, but I\u2019ll get into that topic later in the post.<\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself disregarding wet paint signs, not paying parking tickets, or simply defying the recommended use of Vicks Vapor Rub when the seasonal flu strikes, you\u2019ll click the \u201cedit placements\u201d button. When you do so you will witness the beautiful world of placement targeting:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-instagram-ad-placements1.png\" alt=\"facebook ads placement options and instagram ad placement options\" width=\"564\" height=\"998\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, there are several territories where your ads can be shown, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook\u2019s mobile and desktop newsfeeds<\/li>\n<li>Instagram<\/li>\n<li>The Audience Network<\/li>\n<li>Messenger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may also notice that you are given three options when it comes to devices:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/edit-facebook-ad-placements.png\" alt=\"edit facebook ad placement\" width=\"800\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s break these down for further clarification\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Ad Placements<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to serving social media ads, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-placements\">the Facebook placement<\/a> is the original gangster.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, they have added a few bells and whistles over the years to give advertisers more flexibility in the way their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\">great-looking ads<\/a> appear to audience members. Now, a key distinction that needs to be made is that, unless you choose to target both desktop and mobile at the same time, not all placement options will be available to you.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to only target Facebook users on their <strong>desktop\/laptop computers<\/strong>, you will be limited to Facebook\u2019s newsfeed and right column placement. The newsfeed is self-explanatory; the right column refers to those compressed versions of your ad on the side of the Facebook UI:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placement-desktop-sidebar.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad desktop sidebar placement\" width=\"800\" height=\"311\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you want to target only users on their <strong>mobile devices<\/strong> through this placement, you have the option to serve to the newsfeeds as well as Facebook\u2019s \u201cinstant articles.\u201d Finally, there are a couple of placement options are only available for certain campaign objectives, including in-stream videos and suggested videos:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placement-optimization-in-stream-video.png\" alt=\"facebook ad placement optimization for in stream video ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"666\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Instagram Ad Placements<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 has proven to be a smart move for the tech giant from a user-base perspective. The platform currently boasts 800 million monthly active users (many of which are also Facebook users); this allows current Facebook advertisers the ability to expand their reach on a different platform altogether.<\/p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, you only have the capability to target mobile users on Instagram. That being said, you do however, need to choose between advertising within the Instagram feed, or within Instagram\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-ad-placement-optimization-ig-story-ads.png\" alt=\"instagram story ad placement optimization\" width=\"534\" height=\"842\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, if you aren\u2019t fully in the loop, Instagram\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d are similar to Snapchat\u2019s \u201cstories.\u201d They are time-based images, videos, and gifs where people can record their existences for the viewing pleasure of an engaged(?) audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Audience Network Ad Placements<\/h2>\n<p>The Audience Network gives you a way to extend your reach away from social media entirely and into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/06\/facebook-ads-for-mobile-apps\">mobile apps<\/a> and websites. Your ad can be displayed as either native, banner, or interstitial:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audience-network-ad-placement-optimization.png\" alt=\"facebook audience network ad placement optimization\" width=\"536\" height=\"840\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If your campaigns have a video-related objective you also have the option to run in-stream videos and rewarded videos.<\/p>\n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking &#8211; \u201cI sell professional things to professional people: I don\u2019t want my ad showing up on Tinder amongst the sea of singles who all claim to love puppies and adventure!\u201d Well, you are in luck you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/25\/b2b-facebook-advertising\">saasy B2B marketer<\/a> you. You can exclude specific catagories of apps and websites from the audience network, reducing the amount of wasted clicks. The good news is that these categories and block lists also apply to instant article and in-stream video placements as well:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exclude-content-publishers-facebook-ad-placement.png\" alt=\"facebook ads exclude audience network specific content and publishers\" width=\"800\" height=\"686\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This also applies to religious and political categories. Boom, there you go!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip<\/strong>: <em>If you visit the website of a business with a remarketing pixel and then visit the website of someone you don\u2019t agree with but is also a part of an ad network (i.e Google or Facebook), by default, the advertiser did not choose for their ads to be on the specific website that you chose to visit and revile so much. It is most often not the advertisers fault because many of them do not have the expertise to be able to exclude these sites specifically. You are visiting the site and the ads are following you #knowledge #blessed.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Messenger Ad Placements<\/h2>\n<p>The Facebook messenger placement has two options available for advertisers to choose from: Messenger home, and sponsored messages. The home option is self-explanatory, and is essentially a banner ad that is served in the home menu:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ad-placement-optimization.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ad placement \" width=\"548\" height=\"838\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The sponsored messages ads appear if you choose the \u201cMessenger\u201d objective at the campaign level. This placement allows targeted, in-context ads to re-engage people who have an existing conversation with your business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ad-sponsored-messages.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ad sponsored message optimization\" width=\"512\" height=\"774\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now that I\u2019ve outlined what the available placements are, I will show you how to effectively <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/26\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads\">optimize your Facebook campaigns<\/a> around them to receive the best value for your dollar.<\/p>\n<h2>Optimizing Your Facebook Ad Placements<\/h2>\n<p>The truth is, not every placement works with every campaign objective and, in my experience, it&#8217;s a better idea to cut some out altogether. There are two approaches to placement optimization you can take right out of the gate &#8211; trial &amp; error and goal-centric.<\/p>\n<h3>The \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach to Facebook ad placements<\/h3>\n<p>This approach requires you to set up a campaign (we\u2019ll use the example of a conversions objective).<\/p>\n<p>Take a designated period that you would like to run your ads to a given audience on automatic placements. After the period is over and the data is collected, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the performance in ads manager. To do this, select the ad set or target audience that you ran the test with and open the performance tab on the right-hand side of the screen:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/edit-facebook-ad-placement-options-business-manager.png\" alt=\"edit facebook ad placements in facebook ads manager\" width=\"800\" height=\"95\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once that is opened, select the placements tab on the top right:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/measure-facebook-ad-performance-based-on-placement.png\" alt=\"measure facebook ad performance based on ad placement\" width=\"800\" height=\"325\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see from this example, the placements were set to automatic and Facebook\u2019s algorithm was able to learn and optimize for the placement that yielded the most results for the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/16\/facebook-ad-costs\">lowest cost<\/a> in concordance with my bidding strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Through this method you can methodically go into the ad set and pause down placements that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/10\/facebook-ads-not-delivering\">not performing well<\/a>. Even though Facebook\u2019s algorithm \u201coptimizes\u201d for the best one, it will still spend your money on others to some extent. Going in and cleaning them up will ensure your money is being spent in the best place <strong>as often as possible<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>The \u201cgoal centric\u201d approach to Facebook ad placements<\/h3>\n<p>Quick confessions: I wasn\u2019t entirely truthful in my previous example and before you go and get your ad sets in a bunch let me explain myself.<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned that I had set the ad set to \u201cautomatic placements\u201d for the test. The example being used was a conversions campaign for eBook downloads and the part where I mislead you was that I didn\u2019t run all the placements \u201cautomatically\u201d. In reality, I paused down the audience network from the start and did so for good reason.<\/p>\n<p>After years of advertising on Facebook and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">managing accounts<\/a>\u00a0for a variety of clients, I have become extremely weary of the audience network as a placement in general. When included in conversion-based campaigns I have noticed that, although it underperforms, Facebook insists on serving it to audiences over better performing and more desirable placements like the newsfeed. I have witnessed a similar phenomenon in many website click campaigns, where a large portion of the budget was being allocated for cheap clicks through this placement. This example was in fact set to \u201cautomatic placement\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audience-network-ad-performance-optimization.png\" alt=\"facebook audience network optimization based on performance visualized \" width=\"800\" height=\"289\" \/><\/div>\n<p>On the surface, one would think this isn\u2019t all too bad. Cheaper clicks, more volume, bar graphs that ascend in a stereotypical stock photo manner. Life is good! Right?<\/p>\n<p>Nah.<\/p>\n<p>I have found that, especially when running ads for my personal site, these audience network clicks are often accidental and don\u2019t yield interested users who visit other parts of your site (or convert for that matter). They often bounce immediately: damn their clumsy thumbs! That being said, if you\u2019re one of those \u201cI need to see it to believe it\u201d type folks then be my guest. Try it out for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, when I said, \u201cgoal centric\u201d earlier (as opposed to trial and error), I meant whenever you create a new campaign in Facebook, the first thing you want to do is clearly define what your advertising objective is. When you do this, you want to devote a good amount of thought to what the user\u2019s experience with your ad will be. If you are marketing a free eBook download, do you think people are going to stop playing Candy Crush to download it? Probably not, unless it\u2019s an eBook on how to hack the game. To which I would applaud your hyper-specific targeting strategy.<\/p>\n<p>And so, with that\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Ad Placements by Campaign Goal<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the optimum Facebook ad placements for each available campaign goal.<\/p>\n<h3>Awareness Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a brand awareness campaign, any placement will work. This is all about brand recognition and the key to lock on that door is frequency. If you want to devote considerable budget to this campaign objective I suggest making several relatively small audiences with high daily budgets. This will increase the frequency of your ads across platforms to a point where folks won&#8217;t be able to close their eyes without seeing your ad. Not annoying at all!<\/p>\n<p>If your goal is reach\u2014advertising to more people as opposed to more often\u2014 you\u2019re performing what equates to a traditional media buy. Keep an eye on your frequency capping (so you don\u2019t waste your budget berating the same people with your creative), but feel free to use as many placements as you see fit.<\/p>\n<h3>Consideration Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Consideration campaigns come in significantly more flavors than awareness campaigns, so let\u2019s look at placement options for each one:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Traffic &#8211;<\/strong> Traffic or link clicks campaigns are good to go on all placements with the exclusion of the audience network (optional). Over time I would suggest analyzing placement performance to make further optimizations based on the types of content you are promoting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Engagement <\/strong>&#8211; Automatic placements &#8211; optimize over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>App Installs<\/strong> &#8211; You are restricted to mobile only placements here. I personally treat app installs the same as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/13\/facebook-interest-targeting\">lower funnel conversions<\/a> and for that reason place high value on them. Unless you are extremely confident in the relevancy of your audience, then I would exclude the audience network. You may find that users are more likely to download an app when they aren\u2019t already in one.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pied-piper-facebook-ads.png\" alt=\"pied piper facebook ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Video Views<\/strong> &#8211; This objective is available for all placement networks except for Messenger. If it\u2019s only video views you are looking for I would stick with automatic placements. You could also break out the video-specific placements into their own ad set and test them against the others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lead Generation<\/strong> &#8211; Depending on the nature of your offer and form, I would say exclude the audience network for this one. You want people to take an action in submitting information, whether on a landing page or through a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook lead ad<\/a>. They will be more likely to do so within the newsfeeds. <em>From my experience even limiting to only the newsfeeds, will give you a more optimal CPL.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Messages<\/strong> &#8211; You are limited to the messenger placements for this one, which is fine because that\u2019s why it&#8217;s here.<\/p>\n<h3>Conversion Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Conversions<\/strong> &#8211; Everything but the audience network. Seriously &#8211; kill it with fire. Some of my peers also hate Instagram as a conversion placement; I personally love it and have witnessed great results and CPA\u2019s from it. Don\u2019t listen to the haters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Product Catalog sales<\/strong> &#8211; I would set automatic with this one, yet watch it very closely. With ecommerce, you need to be very strict with your CPA\u2019s to be profitable. Break out placements when necessary and bid accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Store visits<\/strong> &#8211; Set to automatic and review results; remove costly placements as they pop up.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tapestry-boston-kilmarnock-st-facebook-store-visits.png\" alt=\"facebook ads for driving store visits\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Device-Specific Facebook Ad Placement Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to get even more methodical with your approach to placement targeting I would suggest breaking out each and testing them against each other with their own budgets. To do this you simply clone an ad set for as many placements you feel necessary to break out. You then exclude all other placements than the one you want to target individually.<\/p>\n<p>Another common practice involves breaking down an audience between mobile and desktop users. This can be particularly valuable for conversion campaigns for you to assess where your best CPA is achieved and then manually devote a larger portion of your budget to the more profitable device.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Just \u201cSet it and Forget it\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>If you are to take away anything from this blog post (aside from excluding the audience network), it\u2019s that the details of Facebook ad placements too often go overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>If you are running campaigns on Facebook, <a href=\"\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">leveraging lookalike audiences<\/a> to find new, qualified leads, you owe it to yourself to get in there and clean things up. Too many advertisers shut down campaigns or ad sets prematurely with the belief that they just \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d In reality, they just weren\u2019t ensuring that their ads were served in the right places.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Knowing which Facebook ad placements will help you reach your goals is tricky.
