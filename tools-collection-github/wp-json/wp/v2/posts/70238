Campaign daily budgets<\/h2>\n<p>The default and most traditional way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-shared-budgets\">manage your spend<\/a> in Google Ads is using a daily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/stretch-your-marketing-budget\">budget<\/a>. When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">create your first campaigns in Google Ads<\/a>, you most likely set them up with their own daily budget. Daily budgets are also commonly used in Microsoft advertising, Facebook ads, and many other platforms using a similar approach.<\/p>\n<h3>How campaign daily budgets work in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/05\/types-of-google-ads\">Every campaign in Google Ads<\/a> can have its own budget. Rather than just inserting your annual or monthly <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">budget<\/a> directly into the campaign, Google asks you to calculate how much you\u2019d like to spend each day. Divide your monthly budget by 30.4 (that\u2019s the average number of days in a month) and set that as your daily budget for your campaign. Google will make sure that you aren\u2019t charged for more than 30.4 times your daily budget in a month.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-set-average-daily-budget.png\" alt=\"google ads set average daily budget\" width=\"720\" height=\"247\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70248 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-set-average-daily-budget.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-set-average-daily-budget-480x165.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>However, your campaign\u2019s daily budget isn\u2019t a cap on what you can spend on any given day. Instead, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/05\/adwords-daily-budget-changes\">Google may spend up to twice as much as your daily budget on any given day<\/a>! Over the course of the month, Google may overspend or underspend your daily budget on any given day depending on when search traffic might be higher. Although on any given day, you may spend more or less than your budget, this will average out over the course of the month and Google won\u2019t charge you more than 30.4 times your daily budget.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-daily-budget.png\" alt=\"google ads budget strategies - average daily budget\" width=\"720\" height=\"334\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70246 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-daily-budget.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-daily-budget-480x223.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of how much your $10 daily budget may spend over the course of a month, via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6385083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Google<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of using campaign daily budgets in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>Daily budgets are used by most advertisers for a good reason: They\u2019re flexible and easy to control.

It can be hard to forecast exactly how much you\u2019re going to spend if at the end of the month each campaign might spend between zero and twice your daily budget. As your account grows in size and complexity, your spend may become increasingly variable and hard to predict and managing these individual budgets can take up a lot of time.<\/p>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/15\/google-ads-budget-report\">Google Ads budget report<\/a> can be helpful here in projecting what your spend will be.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-budget-report-future-1.png\" alt=\"google ads budget report - future projected spend view\" width=\"720\" height=\"294\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53583 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-budget-report-future-1.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-budget-report-future-1-480x196.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Who is campaign daily budgets best for?<\/h3>\n<p>Daily budgets can be ideal for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/19\/google-ads-for-small-businesses\">small business advertisers<\/a> running only a few campaigns and can tolerate slight fluctuations in their overall spend. Daily budgets are also great for campaigns that have consistently good performance or for marketing efforts that have their own dedicated budget.<br \/>\n<a id=\"shared\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Shared budgets<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/19\/how-to-set-your-adwords-budget\">Shared budgets<\/a> were introduced in Google Ads later to help advertisers manage multiple campaigns within their account easier.<\/p>\n<h3>How shared budgets work in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than assigning each campaign its own budget, you can create a shared <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-budget\">budget in Google Ads<\/a> and have multiple campaigns use the same daily budget. For example, rather than giving five campaigns each their own $10 daily budget, advertisers can create one $50 budget and apply it across all five campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>These campaigns will share this larger budget each day and each campaign may spend a different amount. Shared budgets follow the same rules as campaign daily budgets and can similarly overspend or underspend on any given day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-shared-budgets.png\" alt=\"google ads budget strategies - shared budgets\" width=\"720\" height=\"396\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70242 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-shared-budgets.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-shared-budgets-480x264.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To create a shared budget, navigate to the <strong><em>Tools and Settings<\/em><\/strong> icon in the top right corner within Google Ads.

If you ever want to add a new campaign to an existing budget, you can edit the budget and include the new campaign in this shared budget.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of using shared budgets in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>Shared Budgets can massively reduce the complexity of managing individual budgets as your account gets larger. They can also help allocate your budgets more efficiently between campaigns of different sizes as campaigns that have more volume will be able to pull from a shared budget with smaller campaigns that might otherwise underspend.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the disadvantages of using shared budgets in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>The main disadvantage of a shared budget is that you lose some control of the performance of individual campaigns. That $50 shared budget across five campaigns is unlikely to spend an even $10 across each campaign. It\u2019s entirely possible that one campaign might spend $48 of that entire budget, leaving the other campaigns hardly showing on a given day! A well-performing campaign with less volume might be \u201cbullied out\u201d of a shared budget by a larger campaign!<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, campaigns that use some<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\"> automated bidding strategies<\/a> can\u2019t be added to shared budgets. Google recommends creating portfolio bidding strategies for campaigns using these shared budgets to help balance the shared goals of the campaigns united under this budget.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb0 <strong>Want more Google Ads budgeting tips?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Free download <\/strong>&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLDigestibleAdBudgets.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_GoogleAdsBudgetsGuide_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\"><strong>The Easy Guide to Google Ads Budgets<\/strong>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Who is campaign daily budgets best for?<\/h3>\n<p>Shared budgets can be great for advertisers who want to reduce the complexity of managing multiple campaigns and separate budgets.

For this reason, it\u2019s often best to have some campaigns continue to have their own separate daily budget even if most of your other campaigns use shared budgets.<br \/>\n<a id=\"campaigntotal\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>3. Campaign total budgets<\/h2>\n<p>It can be tough to plan out budgets daily for some campaigns, especially if you only plan to run them for a short period of time. For some video campaigns, advertisers can create a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10486938?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign total budget<\/a> instead of a daily budget.<\/p>\n<h3>How campaign total budgets work in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Video campaigns with a set start date and end date can skip the budgeting math of what a daily budget looks like. Instead, within their budget settings, these campaigns can be set with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/09\/adwords-campaign-total-budget\">unique campaign total budget within Google Ads<\/a>. From here, they can set the total amount that they\u2019d like to spend on their video campaign during its limited run. Google will try to spend your total campaign budget evenly until the set end date.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-campaign-total-budget.png\" alt=\"google ads campaign total budget\" width=\"720\" height=\"306\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70249 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-campaign-total-budget.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-campaign-total-budget-480x204.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of using campaign total budgets in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>Campaign total budgets nearly erase the stress of having to manage a daily budget for these video ads. It also gives Google more flexibility to adjust what you spend on a given day to make sure that a slow day doesn\u2019t prevent you from reaching your total budget at the end of a campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, since the start and end dates are more flexible, you don\u2019t need to fret over how Google splits your budget up during any typical monthly period.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the disadvantages of using campaign total budgets in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>Notably, campaign total budgets are only available on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/29\/google-ads-video-campaign-settings\">video campaigns<\/a> and require a start and end date. Your evergreen campaigns can\u2019t use campaign total budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you can not change your campaign total budget to a daily budget once it\u2019s been created. This makes these campaigns using a total budget less flexible as they can\u2019t easily be extended past their original end date.<\/p>\n<h3>Who is campaign total budgets best for?<\/h3>\n<p>Campaign total budgets can be ideal for short-run video campaigns with a preset budget. This makes them perfect to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">promote an upcoming sale<\/a>, event, or product launch to create hype and brand awareness for a limited time with unique creative.<br \/>\n<a id=\"automated\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Automated budget rules<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/01\/google-ads-automated-rules\">Automated rules in Google Ads<\/a> can ease the burden of a lot of tasks for advertisers. Automated rules can help advertisers monitor, increase, decrease, or pause their budgets depending on any set of preset criteria.<\/p>\n<h3>How automated budget rules work in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>From the campaigns tab in Google Ads, automated rules are hidden under the right-most \u201c<strong><em>More<\/em><\/strong>\u201d icon. From there, select \u201c<strong><em>create an automated rule.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-automated-rules.png\" alt=\"google ads budget strategies - automated rules\" width=\"720\" height=\"458\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70244 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-automated-rules.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-budget-strategies-automated-rules-480x305.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From here, you can create a rule. Effectively, you\u2019re telling Google to <strong><em>perform some action<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0to <strong><em>some campaigns<\/em><\/strong>, given <strong><em>some condition<\/em><\/strong>, at <strong><em>some time<\/em><\/strong>.\u00a0 Vague? Let\u2019s break that down:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Apply to (required): <\/em><\/strong>Select whether you want Google to make this change across every campaign or a selection of campaigns whenever this rule runs.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Action (required): <\/em><\/strong>What is it that you want Google to do for you? Your options are:\n<ul>\n<li>Enable campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Pause campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Change budgets<\/li>\n<li>Change labels<\/li>\n<li>Send email<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conditions (optional): <\/strong>What must be true for you to allow Google to make this change in your account for you? You can set these rules to run based on the performance of these campaigns, such as how much they\u2019ve spent or how well they\u2019re performing at the moment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Frequency (required): <\/strong>Effectively, how often do you want Google to check these conditions and run this rule? If there are no conditions set \u2013 then Google will always perform this action at time. Rules can be set to run monthly, weekly, daily, or even hourly. Rules can also be scheduled to run once at a set time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Combined, this logic can help automate budget management a lot easier across an account. For example, let\u2019s say you wanted Google to alert you and pause your campaigns if they ever spent over $5,000 a month. That task could keep a diligent account manager up late at night as they approach $5,000 at the end of the month \u2013 but an automated rule can let them sleep easy at the end of the month.
