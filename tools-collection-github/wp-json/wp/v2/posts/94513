My goal was to get a list of questions my<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\"> target audience<\/a> of runners asks about nutrition so that I can turn them into a series of blog and social media posts.<\/p>\n<p>Abbie gave me the editable prompt she uses for the task:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat are the questions [target demographic] are asking the most frequently about [topic\/service\/pain point]? Look for them on social sites, forums, Reddit, Quora, and other places where [target demographic] ask questions. Find as many as possible.

The process took me less than five minutes to complete.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this tactic<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s easy enough to simply change the topic and audience in Abbie\u2019s prompts. From there, I\u2019d do a few more things to help fill my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">content calendar<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Google and Ahrefs, Moz, or our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to see if any of these terms have close SEO keyword equivalents.<\/li>\n<li>Look for the questions that aren\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">answered to death by my content competitors<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Look for obvious groupings of questions that can be expanded into a more comprehensive piece of content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But the potential goes far beyond content. I could see a nutrition business using this to either develop supplements or a dietary program that addresses these questions. Alternatively, an advertiser could build a campaign around how their products address these concerns.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 <strong>Want more?<\/strong> Download the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"repurpose-long-form-content-into-social-media-posts\"><\/div>\n<h2>2.

But a<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/plumber-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> plumber<\/a> or local dentist won\u2019t typically have a full-time, dedicated social media marketer who can create posts fast enough to fill the never-ending need for content.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/annabyang\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Burgess Yang<\/a> knows this challenge well.

I\u2019m not a fan of using AI to write copy wholesale.

And the overuse of emojis is a common AI tell. But I do like that ChatGPT added some<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\"> hashtags<\/a>. It definitely needs a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\"> call to action<\/a>. And to be fair, the blog post was pretty high-level.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to try one more. This is a much longer post about running nutrition. I skipped the \u201ckey takeaways\u201d step and just asked for three social media posts.<\/p>\n<p>I ran into a problem.<\/p>\n<p>It gave me three different ideas for the same blog post. What I wanted was a series of three posts I could plan out for the next week. So I modified the prompt to:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cRead this blog post. Pull out three key points that would make good social media posts. Then write the three posts, making sure they don\u2019t cover the same points. Keep them concise.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It produced three posts around unique topics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fueling before and during your trail run<\/li>\n<li>Recovery and common nutrition mistakes<\/li>\n<li>Smarter everyday nutrition for trail runners<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of the output:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition.webp\" alt=\"AI experiments - social posts by ChatGPT\" width=\"937\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94521 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition-480x250.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Still not fantastic. But it\u2019s at least a start.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this tactic<\/h3>\n<p>After running this experiment, I think I\u2019d use Anna\u2019s initial method and just get ChatGPT to pull key concepts from a long bit of text.<\/p>\n<p>For a local business, that could be a blog post or ebook. It could also be from the transcript of a talk they gave at a local event. Or it could even come from recorded customer conversations and sales pitches.<\/p>\n<div id=\"create-comprehensive-seo-outlines-quickly\"><\/div>\n<h2>3. Create comprehensive SEO outlines quickly<\/h2>\n<p>The most effective blog posts are built on well-crafted outlines. When you have a solid structure, a novel theme, and strong key components (like stats and quotes), the end result has a much better chance of engaging readers and being<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\"> ranked by search engines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s not new to ask AI to throw together a quick outline.

That means you can give it complex, multi-step tasks that require digging through multiple websites.<\/p>\n<p>I took on the persona of marketing manager for a private preschool. The test aims to determine if I can obtain a usable SEO-focused outline from ChatGPT\u2019s Agent Mode for a relevant, high-volume keyword.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to base this test on the keyword \u201cpreschool curriculum\u201d because it has decent search volume and a manageable difficulty level.<\/p>\n<p>I used the exact prompt Chris shared, only adjusting it for my keyword:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cCan you look at the top Google results for \u2018preschool curriculum?\u2019 Based on those results, can you provide a content outline that contains: 1) 6-8 sections of content to create with notes, 2) FAQs to add to the page, and 3) Semantic entities to include on the page.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Agent Mode went to work. Over the course of 8 minutes, it read several ranking articles and seemed to search for subtopics (like match curricula, etc.).

But I noticed some obvious sections missing for this to meet the reader&#8217;s intent. I think that\u2019s down to two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT chose an intent: <\/strong>The intent of the highest-ranking posts was mixed. Some were promotional and aimed at educating parents about a school\u2019s curriculum. Others were informational and written for an audience of teachers and administrators. ChatGPT chose a fairly generic intent designed for parents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It didn\u2019t address Google search features: <\/strong>The outline doesn\u2019t seem to follow or reference the topics in Google\u2019s \u201cPeople also ask\u201d or \u201cThings to know\u201d snippets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How to use this tactic<\/h3>\n<p>Chris\u2019s strategy would be really useful to help a non-SEO expert create blog post outlines. You could even use this for your newsletter or lead magnet guides.<\/p>\n<p>Chris said in his post that this is a progressive work that can take some back and forth to get it where you want it. Here are some things I\u2019d do to dial in the results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confirm your target audience: <\/strong>Don\u2019t make the AI decide who your audience is. Add that into your prompt so if the intent is a little murky, you\u2019ll get an outline that\u2019s relevant to the people you need to engage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Feed it SERP info:<\/strong> Agent Mode told me it can\u2019t access live SERP features like People also ask. Those are important to address in an SEO blog post. So try copying and pasting them into your AI dialogue.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Switch to standard mode for basic questions:<\/strong> Agent mode does a lot of deep thinking. If you just want to know something like \u201ccan you access SERP features,\u201d it\u2019s much faster to switch to the standard ChatGPT mode and ask it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>SEO is a good option for driving traffic.<\/strong> Find more in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"pull-insights-from-hundreds-of-customer-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h2>4.

I could also use the feedback to change up my services or reposition them to better meet expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Matt uses actual customer quotes as<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\"> social proof<\/a> in marketing assets, which is absolute gold. I think the next experiment would be to try giving ChatGPT a specific directory to see what it can read, and rework the prompt to ask for quotes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"analyze-your-competitors\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Analyze your competitors<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">Studying your competitors<\/a> can be the best source of new ideas to grow your business. It\u2019ll highlight gaps in your product or service offerings, give you new ways to position what you sell,\u00a0 show you which customer segments aren\u2019t being serviced, and a whole lot more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/celiaquillian\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Celia Quillian<\/a>, director of AI and growth at <a href=\"https:\/\/greenlight.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greenlight<\/a>, told us how she makes that easier by using ChatGPT to analyze competitors\u2019 websites for things like branding, product descriptions, and so on.<\/p>\n<h3>The experiment<\/h3>\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\">tried a version of this<\/a> using the unpaid version of ChatGPT a while ago with limited results. For this experiment, I wanted to see if the updated, paid version could do better. And if it would work for a small local business. In this case, a yoga studio.<\/p>\n<p>I started by asking ChatGPT to provide a comprehensive and reusable prompt. Here it is:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Review these three competitor websites: [link 1], [link 2], [link 3].<br \/>\nAnalyze them for:<\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Pricing<\/em><\/strong><em><em> \u2013 How they show or hide prices, tiers, packages, or promotions.<\/em><\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Branding &amp; Messaging<\/em><\/strong><em><em> \u2013 The tone, visuals, and value propositions they use to appeal to customers.<\/em><\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Positioning &amp; Differentiation<\/em><\/strong><em><em> \u2013 What makes each stand out (or blend in) compared to the others.<\/em><\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Website Experience<\/em><\/strong><em><em> \u2013 Ease of navigation, calls-to-action, and how clear it is for a visitor to take the next step.<\/em><\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Content &amp; Engagement<\/em><\/strong><em><em> \u2013 Use of blogs, FAQs, videos, reviews, or other elements that build trust and engagement.*<\/em><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Finally, summarize the <strong>strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities<\/strong> for a small business competing with them.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I switched back to Agent Mode and put AI to work reviewing the websites of three top-rated yoga studios in Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>Using just this prompt, ChatGPT created an eight-column table with information for each of the three businesses. It was a little hard to read in the dialogue box, so I asked for a downloadable CSV file.<\/p>\n<p>Again, a touch of formatting and, voil\u00e0:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart.webp\" alt=\"AI experiments - chart of competitor data.\" width=\"937\" height=\"241\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94528 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart-480x123.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I think the best part is the cost analysis. If you pick the three studios nearest yours, you could quickly see if you\u2019re over- or under-priced for your neighborhood. Plus, you\u2019d get ideas for how to create and promote packages.<\/p>\n<p>I also loved the weaknesses column. It shows several ways you could gain an advantage, like with pricing transparency and a more easily navigable website.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this tactic<\/h3>\n<p>As is, Celia\u2019s tactic is instantly usable for just about any local business. My experiment is also just the beginning of what you can learn.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I asked a few of these questions and got back a lot more detail:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do these websites have a blog, and have they published recently?<\/li>\n<li>How does the website capture leads or motivate visitors to take the next step? Do they use specific calls to action? Is their schedule system easy to find?<\/li>\n<li>What types of social proof do they include (reviews, testimonials, awards, etc.)?<\/li>\n<li>What do they do for local SEO (do they mention the city or neighborhood name often, show involvement in community events, partner with local businesses)?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may have clued in on the mentions of \u201creviews.\u201d You can combine this tactic with a review search to see what people say about your competitors and gather additional information to work with.<\/p>\n<h2>Try these AI tactics for your business<\/h2>\n<p>The goal of these experiments was to find ways a small business can use AI for better marketing. The overall answer is yes, each of these tactics can be adapted for a local business to use quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Each business is unique, though. And AI has seemingly infinite adaptability. So try the prompts and workflows I\u2019ve listed here, and then start asking your AI more questions about the results. If you want to know more about your competitors or which products people have the most problems with, challenge AI to figure it out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We tested five AI workflows to see if they could be adapted for local businesses.
