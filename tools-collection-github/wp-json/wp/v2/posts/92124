Your website and blog are content marketing. So is your social media presence.

It\u2019s not about passively reading or watching. Instead, interactive content invites your audience to, well, interact!<\/p>\n<p>Some brands shy away from interactive content because it can take more time to create. Unlike a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/27\/blog-post-ideas\">blog post<\/a>, which is pretty straightforward and can often be drafted and posted by your internal team, interactive content might require more support. For example, a custom quiz may need the assistance of a writer, designer, and web developer.<\/p>\n<p>However, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/06\/content-marketing-tools\">online tools<\/a> grow more sophisticated, there are drag-and-drop options that empower your team to create simple but effective interactive content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Warby Parker quiz.\" width=\"771\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92129 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker.webp 771w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker-480x374.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This quiz from glasses brand <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/quiz\/hto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Warby Parker<\/em><\/a><em> helps consumers find the perfect frames from the comfort of their own homes.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-use-interactive-content\"><\/div>\n<h2>Benefits of interactive content<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re all looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-differentiate-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make our content stand out<\/a>, especially when AI makes it easy to create a dozen blog posts with a few prompts. Interactive content fits the bill perfectly. In fact, using interactive content can help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase engagement:<\/strong> By nature, content like quizzes and polls encourages active participation, making it more engaging than other types of content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Generate attention and leads: <\/strong>Interactive content generates up to <a href=\"https:\/\/outgrow.co\/blog\/statistics-interactive-content\">five times<\/a> more views than its static counterparts and enjoys double the conversion rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Boost virality: <\/strong>People love to brag about high scores and tell their friends what kind of sandwich bread they are, so interactive content motivates a lot of social sharing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lift brand retention:<\/strong> Immersive experiences stick with us, and when someone benefits from your interactive content, they\u2019re more likely to remember your brand longer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Interactive content is also a great source of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">customer data<\/a>.

You\u2019ve come to the right place. Read on for a list of interactive content types to try, plus see real-world examples of different tactics in action.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Quizzes<\/h3>\n<p>If you were online in the aughts and 2010s, you likely remember the grip that BuzzFeed quizzes had on the culture.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/27\/marketing-quiz\">Online quizzes<\/a> are intriguing because they put the quiz taker at the center of the experience. A BuzzFeed-style quiz invites a user to discover something unique about themselves. Who doesn\u2019t want to learn which Golden Girls character they are? This style of quiz encourages sharing\u2014once you discover you\u2019re a Dorothy, you want to tell your friends and see who\u2019s the Blanche in your group!<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, online quizzes that test your knowledge are engaging because they allow the taker to aim for a high score and feel smart. These trivia-based quizzes often share how you stack up against others.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, quizzes can serve as a sales tool. For example, DTC makeup brand Il Makiage uses its POWERMATCH quiz to help buyers find the right foundation shade\u2014something that might otherwise be a hurdle for an online-only business.<\/p>\n<p>The quiz makes it easy for prospects to identify their ideal shade and make a purchase they\u2019ll be pleased with.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Quiz from Maikage.\" width=\"937\" height=\"341\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92130 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-makup-480x175.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ilmakiage.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca5 <strong>Let\u2019s keep the leads flowing! <\/strong>Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"games\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Games<\/h3>\n<p>Like quizzes, games can be similarly attractive and addictive. As an example, The New York Times boasts over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/media\/new-york-times-games-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 million<\/a> daily players of its word and logic games.<\/p>\n<p>If games can create that kind of draw for a newspaper, they can do the same for you. And while games certainly require more development than, say, a simple survey or quiz, the investment can be worthwhile.<\/p>\n<div id=\"calculators\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Calculators<\/h3>\n<p>Online calculators can be an incredible educational tool for your audience. This particular type of interactive content is great for brands that sell expensive or complex offerings. Customers might need additional education about the financial implications of making a purchase decision.<\/p>\n<p>A classic example is a bank offering a mortgage calculator. Deciding to buy a home is one of the biggest financial decisions a person will make in their lifetime, so a calculator that helps them visualize the full cost implications of that decision can go a long way toward assuaging concerns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Home cost calculator.\" width=\"630\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92131 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp 630w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator-480x457.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 630px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.suffolkcu.org\/learn\/financial-literacy\/financial-calculators\/mortgage-calculators\/mortgage-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Suffolk Credit Union<\/em><\/a><em> uses its mortgage calculator to help prospective homebuyers understand monthly costs.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Calculators can also work for B2B brands that sell a high-cost business solution. Typically, numerous decision-makers weigh in on a B2B buying decision, and the leaders will often want to know the costs and benefits of making a big purchase.<\/p>\n<p>If you can create a calculator that accurately represents the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/20\/content-marketing-roi\">ROI<\/a> of purchasing your solution, you give B2B buyers greater assurance that your offering is worth the cost.<\/p>\n<div id=\"polls\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Polls<\/h3>\n<p>Comments sections, thumbs up, ratings\u2014people love sharing their opinions online. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/04\/instagram-story-ads-polls\">Creating a poll<\/a> is a form of interactive content that gives your audience another chance to make their voice heard.<\/p>\n<p>Polls can be used just for fun to drive engagement, or they can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">gather customer insights<\/a> and guide real business decisions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a DTC mattress brand might post an informal poll in its social media stories asking followers to share whether they\u2019re a side sleeper, back sleeper, or stomach sleeper. The subsequent stories could then show the best mattress for each sleep position.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, a business might use a poll to crowdsource information about a new product launch. As an example, a local restaurant looking to add entertainment to its evening schedule might ask its audience whether they\u2019d prefer a trivia night, comedy show, or live music.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Every piece of interactive content needs a great call to action! <\/strong>Get ideas to create your own in <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"surveys\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Surveys are another way for businesses to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">gather vital information<\/a> from their audience. Surveys tend to be used for an explicit business purpose, like gathering feedback on a recent buying experience.<\/p>\n<p>But a well-designed survey can encourage readers to complete it, even if it\u2019s ultimately for your benefit. Fortunately, there are plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">free online survey tools<\/a> that can help any business launch an engaging survey.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Media survey.\" width=\"305\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92132 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp 305w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-media-153x300.webp 153w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/us-news\/thejournal-survey-a5abec57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Journal<\/em><\/a><em> podcast wanted to collect feedback on a potential upcoming live event, and it created a survey to ask its audience what they\u2019d like to see there.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Surveys are a great way to open the door to deeper conversations with your audience. At the end of a survey, you can invite the respondents to share contact information and indicate that they\u2019d be open to more discussion. Even if you don\u2019t connect directly, showing that you care about their thoughts makes your audience feel more seen and heard.<\/p>\n<div id=\"assessments\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Assessments<\/h3>\n<p>Assessments fall somewhere between quizzes and surveys in the world of interactive content. While a quiz tends to be more lighthearted, an assessment is a tool with a bit more weight.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - online assessment.\" width=\"826\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92133 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp 826w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz-480x349.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/view.flodesk.com\/pages\/5fc7b185f10e2d0d8e955631\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Therapist and author Nedra Glover Tawwab<\/em><\/a><em> has several assessments available on her website.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Service businesses might use assessments to help prospective customers determine if they have an issue the business can solve. For example, a physical therapy office might create an assessment for athletes who are trying to decide if their injury requires professional help to heal. Or, a tutoring business might offer an assessment to help parents evaluate whether or not their children could benefit from some academic support outside the classroom.<\/p>\n<div id=\"image-sliders\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Image sliders<\/h3>\n<p>Before-and-after images have long been a powerful marketing tool for showcasing certain products and services. If you\u2019ve ever watched an infomercial, you\u2019ve probably seen this technique used to demonstrate the power of the product being sold.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Image slider of a bathroom remod.\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92134 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp 599w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-slider-480x481.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.will-myers.com\/products\/p\/before-\/-after-image-slider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>This example<\/em><\/a><em> from a home renovation shows how the contractor transformed a dark and outdated bathroom on the right into a bright, modern, functional space.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Online, you can create interactive image sliders that align before-and-after photos, allowing viewers to slide between the two. As they do, they\u2019ll see the impact of the business\u2019s product or service.<\/p>\n<p>This interactive content tactic can be applied in a variety of industries, from dental practices showcasing the results of a teeth whitening session to landscapers demonstrating the transformation of a scruffy backyard into a perfectly pruned oasis.<\/p>\n<div id=\"maps\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Maps<\/h3>\n<p>When you think of digital maps, you likely envision the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">Google Maps<\/a> interface. But businesses can create interactive maps as part of their content marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these maps can be used to show your business\u2019s physical footprint if yours is a multi-location operation. But interactive maps can serve other purposes, too.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a travel brand that hosts safaris in Tanzania might create an interactive map that shows where in the national parks you might expect to see different types of wildlife. Or, a retail brand might create a map of its store, allowing customers to virtually browse and navigate the space.<\/p>\n<div id=\"multimedia-long-form-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Multimedia long-form content<\/h3>\n<p>Long gone are the days when a static PDF is your only option for presenting an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-write-an-ebook\">ebook<\/a>, whitepaper, or other type of long-form content to your readers.<\/p>\n<p>Today, it\u2019s possible to create interactive, multi-page documents with embedded videos, moving text, clickable images, and headers that open a pop-up with additional information, among other features.<\/p>\n<p>By making your long-form content more dynamic, you encourage more active reading and less skimming. Slowing your readers down and engaging them throughout the paper helps showcase the full value of your long-form content.<\/p>\n<div id=\"interactive-video\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Interactive video<\/h3>\n<p>Video is already a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/15\/video-content-marketing\">hugely impactful channel<\/a>\u2014HubSpot named short-form video the top content format, delivering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/state-of-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high ROI<\/a> in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>By adding interactive elements to an already high-engagement channel, you can potentially strengthen its effectiveness. Interactive videos allow viewers to click on elements, see more details, and delve further into the topic.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, a car dealership could create an interactive video showing off the latest model to hit its lot. For each new feature shown in the video, the dealership could add clickable pop-up text that gives even more information on the benefits and specs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - Video from the Edinburgh Zoo.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92135 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-980x559.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/blog\/post\/3-creators-using-vimeo-interactive-to-make-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>This interactive video<\/em><\/a><em> from the Edinburgh Zoo invites viewers to choose their own adventure (would you like to see the sun bears or penguins first?) and to click to learn more about each animal along the way.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"interactive-social-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Interactive social content<\/h3>\n<p>Social media platforms know the power of interactive content, and that\u2019s why many have incorporated interactive features for users to harness.<\/p>\n<p>On Instagram and TikTok, you can add poll or quiz stickers to your Stories or videos. On LinkedIn, you can create and run a poll.<\/p>\n<p>Including interactive content regularly on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/social-media-calendar-template\">social media content calendar<\/a> keeps your audience engaged. It reinforces that your business\u2019s social media page is a place for dialogue with you, and positions you as an approachable, friendly brand.<\/p>\n<div id=\"augmented-reality\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. Augmented reality<\/h3>\n<p>Augmented reality (AR) won\u2019t be right for every business, but there are certain industries where the technology is a natural fit.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, AR inserts a computer-generated image into a real physical space. On mobile devices, users can point their camera at the environment they\u2019re in, and AR can add a digital image to the real world shown on the screen.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp\" alt=\"Interactive content - AR of a room showing a chair.\" width=\"937\" height=\"527\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-92136 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png-480x270.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/global\/en\/newsroom\/innovation\/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912\/?assetId=0-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Many furniture companies use AR tools to allow consumers to virtually try pieces in their homes before buying.
