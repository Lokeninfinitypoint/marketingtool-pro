As we continue to see the outbreak spread and governments and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/13\/covid-19-response\">businesses respond to COVID-19<\/a>, we\u2019ve seen changes in every aspect of our daily life. Even on the Google SERP, we\u2019ve seen large shifts in the way people search during this crisis. Advertisers know all too well that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">COVID-19 has impacted many industries&#8217; PPC campaigns<\/a>, but understanding how to adjust to these rapidly changing trends can help keep our campaigns and businesses agile during this scary time.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we\u2019re looking across tens of thousands of advertisers to understand the impact of COVID-19 on PPC advertising. In this article, we\u2019ll examine how search habits are changing during COVID-19 and how advertisers should adjust their PPC strategies.<\/p>\n<p><em>Post-COVID-peak update: We have more data and patterns in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/28\/resilient-digital-agencies-2020\">this post on resilient digital agencies in 2020<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>COVID-19 related searches surge on Google<\/h2>\n<p>As the coronavirus pandemic dominates our concerns, news, politics, and economy, it\u2019s dominating our Google searches. In fact, today, COVID-19 related searches are now <strong>the most popular searches on Google, <\/strong>far exceeding searches about other news, weather, politics, Google, Facebook, Amazon, or even porn.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4e368e5f-d3b7-4cb7-8110-c62373051b97\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-google-search-trends.jpg\" alt=\"Google search trends during the COVID-19 outbreak\" width=\"779\" height=\"381\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In response to this surging trend in new searches, Google has released the <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/story\/US_cu_4Rjdh3ABAABMHM_en\">Google Trends Coronavirus Hub<\/a> to help track these emerging searches as well as other breakout searches that users are taking as they respond to developing news in the world. Advertisers should review these search trends regularly and be prepared to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/negative-keywords\">add new negative keywords<\/a> to their campaigns to prevent wasting their budgets online.<\/p>\n<h3>COVID-19 searches spike early in the morning and late at night<\/h3>\n<p>Understandably, the pandemic is top of mind for most of us. But for those of us fortunate enough to not be actively fighting the disease on the front lines, we find ways to distract ourselves throughout the day and continue our lives in some shade of normalcy. Still, Google trends reveals that the coronavirus is often on our minds, but especially when we first wake up and before we go to bed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2426e338-de8e-4239-9e30-dbfd46b41902\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-google-search-trends-morning-and-night.jpg\" alt=\"COVID-19 Google search trends: morning and night spikes in coronavirus-related searches\" width=\"778\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>There\u2019s some variance throughout the day, such as around 6 p.m. and during press briefings, but it\u2019s interesting to see these peaks so early and late in the day. It\u2019s an uncommon trend\u2014you usually see searches peak during mid-day working hours and after dinner, but the coronavirus searches buck that trend and peak when many traditional searches would slow down.<\/p>\n<p>That means advertisers need to be adjust their accounts accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentTextLinkPPCCOVID19Guide.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_COVID19Guide_Download\">Navigate the changing online advertising landscape with this free small business guide to COVID-19.<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<h3>Changes to search volume means changes to ad impressions<\/h3>\n<p>As many of us shelter in place or otherwise commute less during the pandemic, we\u2019re staying up and online later than we normally would. That coupled with this unusual late night COVID-19 search habit has fundamentally changed when we\u2019re searching online. Even in industries not immediately impacted by the coronavirus-related searches, we\u2019re still seeing large spikes in late night searches and ad impressions in their PPC campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"294504e3-1e85-498b-9137-294055b353f7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-google-search-trends-changes-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google search changes during COVID-19 outbreak\" width=\"756\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Many advertisers have been noticing less search interest for their products throughout March due to COVID-19, that\u2019s felt the hardest during peak hours. Later in the evening, though, that impact is much less noticeable and search volume has even <strong>increased by about 15% after midnight<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, searches on weekends have been much less impacted by these negative trends that we see during the week. During most weekend hours, search volume is within 10% of it\u2019s pre-pandemic averages, and it\u2019s also increasing significantly in the late-night hours.<\/p>\n<h2>The impact on your PPC campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>At first glance, that increase in search volume late at night might be look like a relief to advertisers\u2014but be careful.
