Although it started off small, Microsoft\u2019s search engine has continued to grow in Google\u2019s shadow and now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comscore.com\/Insights\/Rankings\">according to ComScore<\/a>, Bing and its partners make up a combined 35.6% of the US desktop search market!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to its native integration in Microsoft products like Office, Skype and Xbox, as well as Bing being the preferred <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">search engine of many voice search<\/a> agents, nearly half of the US population uses Bing every month. In addition to reaching all these billions of searches happening on Bing, data shows that simply by advertising on Bing, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\">you\u2019ll notice more people searching for your brand and products on Google<\/a> as well!<\/p>\n<p>Although many advertisers may look to Bing simply to expand the reach of their existing Google campaigns, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">Bing Ads has a few unique advantages to Google Ads<\/a> that dedicated SEMs can take advantage of. Additionally, just like on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">Google Ads<\/a> (formerly known as AdWords), performance can differ across different industries on Bing \u2013 making it extra lucrative for certain advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>How does your Bing Ads performance stack against the industry benchmarks?

Bing (and Microsoft\u2019s recently acquired LinkedIn) may prove to be the ideal market for many B2B advertisers, boasting very high CTRs within that industry as well (3.01%).

Bing also still serves <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/22\/google-kills-off-right-side-ads\">ads in the right hand rail of the SERP<\/a>, unlike Google, which gives it more room to show ads from advertisers with lower bids.<\/p>\n<p>Even in expensive and typically highly competitive industries like Legal, advertisers still get a bargain on Bing with a low $1.42 CPC, despite the fact that keywords like \u201cLawyer\u201d and \u201cAttorney\u201d find themselves as the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/19\/most-expensive-keywords-bing-ads\">most expensive keywords on Bing.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, Bing\u2019s traffic is oftentimes more expensive for retail advertisers than that on Google.
