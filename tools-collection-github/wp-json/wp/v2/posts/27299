Here are the <strong>5 elements of a strong inbound marketing strategy<\/strong>, which you should be using!<\/p>\n<h2>#1: SEO<\/h2>\n<p>SEO (<a href=\"\/seo\">search engine optimization<\/a>) is a hard-to-control, waste-of-time tactic, right? Wrong: SEO is the process of optimizing your website\u2019s content and structure for search in order to receive organic placements on the search engine results pages or SERPS. Having a quality website and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/28\/free-content-marketing-tools\">content optimized<\/a> for SEO ensures that Google\u2019s web-crawling technology is able to identify and index your site\u2019s content to have it appear for free to people searching. SEO is a critical part of your inbound strategy because <strong>if you can\u2019t be found, then you\u2019re not going to get business<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c4ac3c47-a7d0-4e8d-af37-ecda30dd81a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-strategy-seo.png\" alt=\"Inbound marketing strategy screenshot showing organic results on SERPS\" width=\"713\" height=\"616\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>When SEO comes to mind I think keywords, code, website structure, link-building, and then my head starts spinning. SEO can actually get very complicated, quickly, so what should you be focusing on to get started? Start by identifying and utilizing the <a href=\"\/keywords\">most important keywords<\/a> to your leads. Of course you want to ensure these keywords have high enough search volume and user intent to attract the most relevant audience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are many aspects of SEO, from the words on your page to the way other sites link to you on the web. Sometimes SEO is simply the matter of making sure your site is structured in a way that search engines understand,\u201d explains Moz.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not an SEO guru by any means. Luckily, there\u2019s a plethora of free resources online so I\u2019d recommend hoping over to <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/beginners-guide-to-seo\">Moz<\/a> and our own <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO basics guide<\/a> to get started.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: PPC<\/h2>\n<p>Now we\u2019re speaking my language! You might be thinking, wait \u2013 PPC is a paid tactic and aren\u2019t paid strategies against the inbound methodology? Wrong! <a href=\"\/learn\">Paid search<\/a> is technically still part of the inbound marketing family since search ads appear when a user is <em>actively searching for something<\/em>, therefore PPC ads are not interrupting another activity. Not all aspects of PPC will quality as inbound (like display ads), but ads on the search network are certainly one of the strongest elements of a strong inbound strategy, because search queries show so much intent.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"415f187f-878e-4f65-b208-7052eef1840d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-strategy-ppc.png\" alt=\"Inbound marketing strategy showing paid results on SERPS\" width=\"703\" height=\"414\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So, <a href=\"\/ppc-seo\">how is PPC different then SEO<\/a>? With paid ads you\u2019re paying for the placements on the SERPs rather than appearing organically. Why pay when you can appear organically? For multiple reasons&#8230; With SEO:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have far less control over when and how you appear on the search results page<\/li>\n<li>A tweak in the algorithms can ruin your organic visibility<\/li>\n<li>Seeing results often takes a long time (and isn\u2019t guaranteed!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With paid search you\u2019re able to <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">pay for the top placements<\/a> where people are more likely to see your ads, and bid on specific keywords to attract qualified visitors. You have the control to adjust your budget, pause your ads during irrelevant times, target mobile searchers, easily measure your ROI, and the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>Moral of the story is that you should be doing both SEO and PPC to get the highest volume and quality of leads.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Content Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>You wouldn\u2019t have guests over and not serve a cocktail, right? The same goes for leads! Now that you\u2019ve warmly welcomed them in the door through PPC and\/or SEO you need to provide them something to drink, aka content. Oftentimes marketers think of content as the sole component to inbound marketing strategy, and while it\u2019s certainly not the only aspect, it is a very critical one. Without <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/04\/content-strategy-for-the-web\">fresh and useful content<\/a> there is no chance of keeping and converting your leads. Your content should come in multiple forms with the goal of helping your audience answer a question or solve a problem.<\/p>\n<p>The key to content marketing is that your content needs to stand out. \u201cYour content must be remarkable enough to break through the clutter. It\u2019s not enough to just produce content,\u201d says Entrepreneur\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/237040\">Murray Newlands<\/a>. \u201cYour content must educate, inspire or entertain your audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, where to start?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create a blog<\/strong>: You should already know this, but a quality blog is one of the most effective ways to market a business. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/24\/blogging-tips\">Blogging will help you<\/a> attract new visitors, gain returning visitors, and convince warmer leads.

Hearing from someone like them will instill trust and up the chances of conversion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a content calendar<\/strong>: to ensure you stay on top of publishing fresh content regularly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#4: Social Media<\/h2>\n<p>So you\u2019ve created phenomenal content, published it on your site, and now you\u2019re lounging on your beach chair enjoying a glass of wine? Well, you\u2019re certainly not going to get profitable results with that attitude. You NEED to be attracting new and returning readers by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">sharing and promoting your content on social media<\/a>. Creating the content is only a small piece of the puzzle. Ensuring the content reaches relevant people is where social comes in. This is inbound marketing because only people who want to see your content will follow your brand, and it&#8217;s a great way to &#8220;subsidize&#8221; your organic traffic if you don&#8217;t have great rankings yet.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, anyone who\u2019s anyone is on social media, whether it be Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vine, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">Instagram<\/a>, or Periscope; your audience is likely on multiple of these channels. Determining which platforms are most relevant to your buyer personas in a task in itself, but I can guarantee that several of your leads are spending a significant chunk of their time consuming content through their personal social channels.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"375982f4-6c82-486c-8bb5-282013bc51ff\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-strategy-social.png\" alt=\"Inbound marketing strategy screenshot of a social post\" width=\"612\" height=\"572\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Spend time creating a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/21\/social-media-promotion-tools\">social media promotion plan<\/a> to distribute your content to the right people, analyzing your top performing content, and paying to promote and gain even more traffic to the content that\u2019s resonating with your audience.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">Your landing page<\/a> is where your leads land after clicking on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">your call-to-action<\/a> (another important element of your inbound marketing strategy). Whether it be a product page, a form fill-out to download a whitepaper, or a subscription service page, you need to ensure your landing page is top-notch unless you\u2019d like to jeopardize potential conversions from coming in. Some important elements to keep in mind\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relevancy<\/strong>: You need to make sure that the landing page is relevant to the call-to-action. For example, if your visitor lands on your page from a paid search ad advertising birthday cakes, you wouldn\u2019t send them to a landing page selling Christmas cookies, right?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus: <\/strong>What is the goal of your landing page? Is it to \u201cSign Up for this E-Newsletter!\u201d or \u201cDownload this Guide Today\u201d? Make your landing page\u2019s purpose singular. Ensure the CTA is big, prevalent, and above the fold. Also make sure to restrict the navigation to other pages and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/27\/landing-page-forms\">keep forms short<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Design: <\/strong>This is a major component of keeping visitors engaged. Using videos or images, testimonials, and trust signals are all design elements that can help improve the conversion rates of your landing pages. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/16\/ab-testing-tips\">Run A\/B tests<\/a> to decide on the best designs for your landing pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Bonus Inbound Marketing Tip: Remarketing<\/h2>\n<p>Once a lead has visited your site, expressed interest in your content, products or offerings, you need a strategy in place to keep them engaged. One of the most effective tactics? <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">Remarketing<\/a>. This tactic cookies your site visitors and follows them around the web with ads reminding them to come back. Remarketing can be set in a variety of ways. For instance, you can remarket to anyone who visited your site, show specific ad to visitors who went to a certain page (or a set of pages), or even an ad to someone who has placed items in a shopping cart, but hasn\u2019t converted.<\/p>\n<p>My older sister called me the other day blown away when she saw an ad on Facebook of the exact dress she was just looking at on Nordstrom\u2019s website. Yes, she is a stay-at-home mom who\u2019s a bit disconnected from the marketing world, but it just proves that this tactic resonates with shoppers. Remarketing says \u201cHey there, remember us? Are you still interested?,\u201d which is why the tactic is considered a member of the inbound family since the shopper has already expressed interest.<\/p>\n<p>Covering these five elements will provide a solid infrastructure for a killer inbound marketing strategy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disruptive outbound techniques convert at a much lower rate than inbound marketing strategies.
