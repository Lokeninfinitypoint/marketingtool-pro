Google announced three features that will help advertisers to get the data they need in this privacy-first world.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Enhanced conversions<\/h3>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Short version: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">This tracking feature uses hashed first-party data to produce more accurate, but privacy-friendly, reports.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">More: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Traditionally, third-party data has allowed advertisers to both show a user\u2019s path to the ad that got them to the landing page (for proper attribution), and to track their behavior after they leave that landing page (for remarketing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But without cookies, each visit to your website\/landing pages will be treated as a new session, even if the user has been there before doing other conversion activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">With enhanced conversions, your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/12\/google-tag-manager\">GTM<\/a> tags will send consented, but hashed, first-party data about your website visitors to Google, which it will then match to users in its first-party database, and then sends back aggregated and anonymous conversion information. This way you can more accurately <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/13\/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide\">report on conversions <\/a>and optimize your campaigns while honoring privacy and security regulations. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b56a36e-7e9a-4c26-8724-34c8e870d08e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/google-ads-enhanced-conversions.png\" alt=\"google ads enhanced conversions\" width=\"720\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49034\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/google-ads-enhanced-conversions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/google-ads-enhanced-conversions-480x285.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"\/brett-mchale-3561\">Brett McHale<\/a>, founder of Empiric Marketing, LLC, feels good about this new reporting feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cAnything that can help make <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> more accurate is always a plus for advertisers, particularly if they are trying to match the first-party data they are receiving on their end. Enhanced Conversions will be beneficial to advertisers who are capturing information like phone number, first\/last name, email address, or home address.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Consent mode<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Short version:<\/strong> Tags dynamically adjust to specific cookie preferences a user makes, so you don\u2019t need a complicated tag setup.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More:<\/strong> Consent mode is another way to get more accurate conversion data in a private and secure way. With this feature, your global site tags or GTM tags will default to \u2018denied\u2019 for values like \u2018ad_storage\u2019 and \u2018analytics_ storage\u2019 unless granted by the user in a granular consent banner, like this one:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"74f3e4fa-40e6-4c5f-a4d4-00e930754808\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2021-cookie-consent-banner-1.png\" alt=\"cookie consent popup on a website\" width=\"720\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If a user gives no consent, Google will use <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/marketingplatform\/360\/conversion-modeling-through-consent-mode-google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion modeling<\/a> to fill in the gaps. Consent mode reduces the need for complicated tag setups and, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10548233?hl=en\">Google<\/a>, &#8220;<span lang=\"EN\">recovers 70% of conversion journeys lost due to user consent choices.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the same article, Google presents eligibility requirements for consent mode. Advertisers need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an advertising presence in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK.<\/li>\n<li>Be implementing the<a href=\"https:\/\/iabeurope.eu\/transparency-consent-framework\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> IAB Transparency &amp; Consent Framework <\/a>(TCF v2.0) on your site.<\/li>\n<li>Meet a daily ad click threshold of 100 clicks per day, per country and domain grouping.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Behavioral reporting in Google Analytics<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Short version:\u00a0<\/strong>Machine learning will help to fill in the gaps in Google Analytics Behavior reports to enable more visibility into the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/21\/customer-journey-mapping\">customer journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More:<\/strong> Just as Google is using machine learning to assist with conversion tracking in Google Ads,\u00a0it is also using it to assist with behavioral reporting in Google Analytics. The loss of cookies will throw off a wide range of metrics, like bounce rate, sessions, events, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Many marketers have created new tags in Google Tag Manager and\u00a0separate dashboards to view hidden data that standard GA reporting does not catch. With machine learning and modeling technology, Google hopes to fill in these gaps.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cfd0783-66e5-45ed-9940-63b273b79906\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-livestream-2021-google-analytics-hidden-data-1.png\" alt=\"google analytics event reporting discrepancies without cookies\" width=\"720\" height=\"484\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Google hopes to minimize behavioral\u00a0reporting discrepancies in Analytics with modeling technology.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.datadrivenu.com\/google-analytics-4-cookieless\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Expert input<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite this new addition, <a href=\"\/gordon-donnelly-3569\">Gordon Donnelly<\/a>, WordStream\u2019s, Senior SEO Manager, still feels concerned about the ability to track and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/05\/google-ads-remarketing-lists\">remarket<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are already seeing the ramifications to advertising (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/20\/ios-14-update-facebook-ads\">iOS changes<\/a>).

We&#8217;re not happy about it, but we may as well learn how to use them to our highest benefit. Here are two new automation-related announcements by Google.<\/p>\n<h3>4. tROAS for Video action and Discovery campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Short version:<\/strong> Value-based bidding is now available for Video action and Discovery campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>More: <\/strong>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\">tROAS<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, you can concentrate on metrics that are aligned with your goals, and calculate ROI even if you have multiple offerings with different price points. tROAS is currently available globally in beta for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/17\/discovery-ads\">Discovery campaigns,<\/a> and fully rolled out for Video action campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba983287-197f-4171-afae-f1c4a82bb354\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2021-video-action-campaign-views-1.png\" alt=\"three different ways YouTube video action campaigns can appear\" width=\"720\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">YouTube Video action campaigns appear across YouTube Home feed, watch page, watch next feed, and Google video partners.<\/span><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10147229\"><em>\u00a0(Image source<\/em><\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/susie-marino-4731\">Susie Marino<\/a>, PPC consultant and WordStream Content Marketing Specialist, has mixed emotions\u00a0about this feature.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting Google is introducing tROAS as an option for these two campaign types because it feels as though it&#8217;s contradictory to the platform&#8217;s previous stance on the bid strategy for Search and Display campaigns. We know tROAS for Search and Display is now a legacy strategy, only available as an option under Max Conversion Value (which was announced during the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/14\/google-marketing-live\">2019 Google Marketing Live<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, while Google encourages all account types to leverage this value-based bidding strategy even now with Discovery and Video action campaigns, I still think they have a long way to go to make this a small business-friendly option. This is because not all small businesses have the settings in place for a tROAS strategy to make sense, especially if they&#8217;re offering a service or a product without concrete price points.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Video action campaigns are replacing TrueView for action<\/h3>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Short version:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">By early 2022, TrueView for action campaigns will be upgraded to Video action campaigns, which use responsive ad groups and appear across more Google properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>More: <\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10833639\">announced<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> on June 11 that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/29\/youtube-trueview-ads\">TrueView for action <\/a>campaigns will eventually be replaced with Video action campaigns. Video action campaigns, which came out in June of 2020, are an\u00a0automated campaign\u00a0type\u00a0that gets served\u00a0across multiple Google properties:\u00a0YouTube\u2019s home feed, watch page, watch next feed, and Google video partners.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">They differ from TrueView for action campaigns because they use\u00a0<strong>responsive<\/strong> ad groups rather than\u00a0<strong>standard<\/strong> ad groups. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here&#8217;s what you need to know:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create Video action campaigns now (for the Website Traffic, Sales, and Leads goal types).<\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Starting July 31, 2021, you\u2019ll be able to convert Trueview for action campaigns into Video action campaigns. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">After September 30, 2021 you will no longer be able to create new TrueView for action campaigns.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">In early 2022 all TrueView for action campaigns will be automatically converted to Video action campaigns. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ed0153f2-692b-4d3b-a602-186a47640e1e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2021-video-action-responsive-1.png\" alt=\"option to select responsive or standard for YouTube video action campaigns\" width=\"936\" height=\"230\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">After September 30, 2021, you will not have the option to choose the standard ad group option.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6.
