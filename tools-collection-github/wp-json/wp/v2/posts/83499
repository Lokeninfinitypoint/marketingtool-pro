The experts came back with an unexpected variety of ideas.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Tactic-one-Creatively-distribute-original-data\"><\/div>\n<h3>Tactic #1: Creatively distribute original data<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best things about SEO content is that a single asset can generate organic traffic for a long time.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brooklin-nash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Brooklin Nash<\/a>, Co-Founder of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.beamcontent.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Beam Content<\/a>, has a strategy to replicate that long-lasting success without relying on Google.<\/p>\n<p>It starts with gathering fresh data no one else has. \u201cWe take original data\u2014whether it\u2019s survey data, platform data, or benchmark data\u2014put it into a cohesive, extensive report, and follow up on it with several articles that dive deeper into different aspects of the report,\u201d Brooklin explained.<\/p>\n<p>But the real magic happens in the distribution. Brooklin and the Beam team use a networked distribution strategy to get the content in front of a lot of people without relying on search or spending on ads.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate the strategy, Brooklin shared a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.beamcontent.co\/resources\/closing-the-content-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> recent report<\/a> the Beam team created for their own marketing. It\u2019s based on seven interviews and a survey of 400-plus content marketers and other go-to-market professionals. The goal is to help close the communication gap between content creators and the larger marketing teams they work in, a relevant topic for Beam\u2019s audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy.webp\" alt=\"How to get organic traffic - Screenshot from Beam's report.\" width=\"524\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83502 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy.webp 524w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy-480x550.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 524px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Beam left <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.beamcontent.co\/resources\/closing-the-content-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>its report<\/em><\/a><em> ungated so it could drive organic traffic more effectively.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A survey-based report is great, but it\u2019s not novel.

They\u2019ve planned a few follow-up articles of their own. They\u2019ve also accepted a pitch from an outside industry expert who\u2019ll write a post, add their commentary, and expose it to the expert\u2019s network.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe launched in April, but this should support follow-up content through the end of the year,\u201d Brooklin noted. \u201cAnd none of it is on search.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this strategy for your business<\/h4>\n<p>This strategy is accessible to just about any marketing team\u2014Brooklin says they\u2019ve used it for clients in a variety of industries.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a physical therapy office could <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">survey<\/a> local runners on their favorite routes, recovery snacks, and cross-training activities, then ask them to share the findings in their feeds.<\/p>\n<p>The three keys to success, according to Brooklin, are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make the content good and engaging:<\/strong> He admits this sounds obvious, but it\u2019s critical. Find an angle that resonates with your audience and surface unique insights you can\u2019t find elsewhere.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Involve people throughout the process:<\/strong> Set the expectation that your internal team and those who provide the data will distribute the content, then give them tools and incentives to do so.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take the long view:<\/strong> Maximize the impact by publishing follow-up content created internally and through external experts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Tactic-two-Use-YouTube-SEO\"><\/div>\n<h3>Tactic #2: Use YouTube SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve spent years honing your ability to get content on the top of search results.

One rule change can close the tap of website visitors.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajdinperco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Ajdin Perco<\/a>, Head of Content at<a href=\"http:\/\/animalz.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Animalz<\/a>, sees newsletters as the solution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe work with a VC investor who&#8217;s been writing a weekly newsletter for over six years, totally by himself,\u201d Ajdin told us. \u201cHe\u2019s built up a large audience on both social and email.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unpack that short statement, and you\u2019ll find three important lessons about generating organic traffic. First, if you\u2019re going to create assets for one channel, like a newsletter, it\u2019s wise to use it as a traffic driver from another channel, like social media. We can&#8217;t share the name of Ajdin&#8217;s VC investor, but this is an example of how a newsletter LinkedIn post would look.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter.webp\" alt=\"How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post with a Newsletter linked in it.\" width=\"425\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83509 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter.webp 425w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter-218x300.webp 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Newsletters can be an organic traffic magnet when you share them on social media.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Second, a single person without extensive marketing knowledge can tackle this tactic. Ajdin said the investor \u201cgets thousands of organic visits every month\u201d from the newsletter he writes himself.<\/p>\n<p>Third, Ajdin said that he\u2019s learned the importance of persistence from this example. Building your newsletter audience will take time, but just like SEO, once the ship sets sail, it\u2019ll keep building steam.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this strategy for your business<\/h4>\n<p>This is probably the most accessible tactic on the list. Many email automation tools are available to help you get started, and there is a nearly endless list of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\"> newsletter ideas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To start building a newsletter pipeline that consistently brings new visits to your website:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross-promote:<\/strong> Share links to your newsletter subscription page in blog posts, on social media, and even in your email signature.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Write from your expertise: <\/strong>It\u2019ll be much easier and more authentic to share your own knowledge, successes, failures, and experiences (like, what challenges did you overcome this week?).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include a compelling<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\"> <strong>call to action<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong> The goal is to get people to click from the newsletter to your website, so give them clear instructions and motivation to do so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Tactic-five-Create-content-teasers-on-social-media\"><\/div>\n<h3>Tactic #5: Create content teasers on social media<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen a few ways to get traffic from social media on this list. This tactic from<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/abbiemood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Abbie Mood<\/a>, the Marketing Director at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.velocityadvisorygroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Velocity Advisory Group<\/a>, is brilliant in its simplicity. She creates teasers for social media posts that give away a bit of the value of her most important content assets. \u201cI usually use this for gated content on the website, but it\u2019s been effective for non-gated content, too,\u201d Abbie said.<\/p>\n<p>According to Abbie, the trick is designing the social post so it resonates with your specific audience. Here\u2019s a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:7194335372007387138\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> LinkedIn teaser<\/a> she used to promote a recent case study for a group of business leaders.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four.webp\" alt=\"How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post from Velocity Advisory Group.\" width=\"437\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83528 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four.webp 437w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Abbie Mood shows off the value of her content on social media with teaser posts.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI create a colorful visual that gives a couple of the stats and\/or shares the challenge and results, but viewers have to click and go to the website to read the full case study and find out how that client got those results.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this strategy for your business<\/h4>\n<p>Abbie\u2019s example shows that this strategy requires creating something that stands out on a busy social feed. But with that effort comes traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips that\u2019ll help make the most of your content teaser posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Find the right platform: <\/b>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms#:~:text=The%20most%20popular%20social%20media%20platforms%20in%202024,-We%20compared%20Statista%27s&amp;text=The%20top%20four%20most%20popular,YouTube%2C%20WhatsApp%2C%20and%20Instagram.\">most popular social media platform<\/a> isn\u2019t right for every business, so choose the one your target customers spend time on and which has features that let your content shine.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t be basic:<\/strong> A few words of copy and a link won\u2019t stop scrollers, so add some visuals and a hook that makes people willing to click for more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test for a variety of content:<\/strong> For Abbie, teasers work like a charm for case studies, but you might find it better for your original research or expert round-up posts (yes, that\u2019s an Easter egg for the next tactic).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Tactic-six-Include-industry-experts-in-your-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>Tactic #6: Include industry experts in your content<\/h3>\n<p>According to the tenets of Google\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\"> E-E-A-T<\/a> quality content guidelines, including first-person experiences and expert accounts in your content can help it rank. But you\u2019ll also bake a powerful organic distribution strategy into the post when you involve pros from your industry.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we call these our expert-led posts (like in the one you\u2019re reading, for example). They reliably generate thousands of organic visits, mostly from non-Google channels.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post.webp\" alt=\"How to get organic traffic - WordStream post.\" width=\"426\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83512 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post.webp 426w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post-218x300.webp 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Including expert voices in our content makes it more interesting and creates an automatic distribution network.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Each post features several industry experts who have experience with the post\u2019s topic. We quote them, link to whichever websites or accounts they like, and ask them to share the post in whatever way makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Once the article is published, we link to it in our regular newsletter and on social media posts. We tag the expert and, if applicable, the business they own or work for. That doubles the repost opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post.webp\" alt=\"How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post sharing the WordStream content.\" width=\"581\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83511 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post.webp 581w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post-480x496.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 581px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>LinkedIn is a great channel for getting reposts of your expert-led content.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many marketing pros we include come from our personal networks. But we also reach out to people we\u2019ve seen post on LinkedIn because we know they have a following and are familiar with the topic.<\/p>\n<p>We completed three of these posts as an initial test. Collectively, they generated over 19,000 organic pageviews. Even better, more than 70% of that traffic came from sources outside of Google.<\/p>\n<p>It takes much longer to produce and promote an expert-led post, so we repost it a couple of times on social channels to squeeze as much value as possible from it.<\/p>\n<p>We also recycle the experts\u2019 quotes. For example, we may reference a quote from the lead generation post in a future search-optimized guide about lead generation. It\u2019s a nice and easy way to add authority to SEO content.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this strategy for your business<\/h4>\n<p>You can swipe this strategy if you have experts in your industry, especially if they\u2019re active on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Since the experts are at the heart of this strategy, I\u2019d like to share a few tips I\u2019ve found helpful when working with them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respect their time:<\/strong> Make your request simple and let them respond however they like (we\u2019ve had LinkedIn messages, emails, Slack notes, Loom videos, and Zoom\/Teams calls).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give something in return:<\/strong> They\u2019re establishing themselves as thought leaders, too, so offer backlinks, call-outs on social, or any other way you can give them exposure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask for an example:<\/strong> I love examples in content, so I ask sources to share one they were involved in or seen in the wild.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Diversify your traffic sources beyond Google<\/h2>\n<p>In sales, a single-threaded account is one where you only have one point of contact at the prospect\u2019s company. It\u2019s considered a precarious deal because you won&#8217;t close the sale if that point of contact leaves, gets cold feed, or gets outvoted.<\/p>\n<p>If Google is your single thread for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">website traffic<\/a>, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a> is equally at risk. A single algorithm change or expansion of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics\">AI Overviews<\/a> can disrupt the flow of visitors to your site.<\/p>\n<p>The experts we spoke to in this post have fortified their top-of-the-funnel traffic flow, buffeting their businesses from the whims and whirlwinds of search engine algorithms. Give their tactics a try, track what works, and double down on the winners. Then, the next time other marketers scramble to recover from a core update, you can turn up the heat on a few other channels and hardly miss a beat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Diversify your traffic sources with tips from these expert marketers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":263,"featured_media":83684,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-83499","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-marketing-ideas"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How 6 Marketing Pros Drive Traffic (NOT from Google!) | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"You don&#039;t have to rely on Google for low-cost traffic.
