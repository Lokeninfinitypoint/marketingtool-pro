Sure, the strain in my eyes that makes it clear I forgot about the 20-20-20 rule. But there\u2019s also the saved recipes to try for dinners. A few screenshots of wallpaper or bedding or painted trim that I could see in my home. And, inevitably, a bunch of tabs for articles to read, websites to remember, and products to look at. Instagram is a platform for content and engagement, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to drive traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>According to Instagram, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/ad-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90%<\/a> of users follow at least one business account. When you have people following your account or interacting with your content, that\u2019s a good indication that they\u2019re interested in your brand.

Add a link to your bio<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re thinking about content on your Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">driving traffic<\/a> to your website, you need to start with a good foundation. That\u2019s a link in your bio.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, there was one option to make the most of the limited link space: a link in bio. A link in bio is a specific landing page that you customize with links to direct your visitors where you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/limited-time-offers\/\">drive traffic<\/a>. This could include a link directly to your website, another to sign up for your newsletter, or another to start a demo with access to an exclusive offer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram.webp\" alt=\"example of instagram account with link in bio and CTA in description\" width=\"808\" height=\"285\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram.webp 808w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram-480x169.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are different tools that you can use to create a link in bio. <a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linktree<\/a> is common and has a free tier, <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/link-in-bio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Later <\/a>offers its own free version, and if you\u2019re using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/marketing\/biosite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace<\/a> for your website, you can create one there. The most important thing is to make sure to keep these updated.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram-links.webp\" alt=\"example of links in instagram bio\" width=\"807\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram-links.webp 807w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/branch-basics-instagram-links-480x357.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 807px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/services-and-software\/instagram-now-allows-5-links-in-bio-heres-how-to-add-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023<\/a>, Instagram allows up to five links in an Instagram bio. While many businesses still use a link in bio to aggregate the links and brand the experience, others simply add multiple links and CTAs right into their bio in the platform to avoid the additional step for visitors.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Using Google Ads to drive website traffic?<\/strong> Make sure it&#8217;s getting the best results with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"avoid-directing-people-to-link-in-bio\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Avoid directing people to that link<\/h3>\n<p>This is counterintuitive, I know, but such is life following the algorithm. You need to have a link in bio so that visitors can navigate to your website easily. But it\u2019s worth noting that you don\u2019t want to tell people to click the link in your bio explicitly, not by writing that in a caption or saying it in a video. Referring people to the link in your bio will actually get your post suppressed by the Instagram algorithm, limiting your reach and engagement and, by extension, your potential traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/link-in-bio-captions-study.webp\" alt=\"study showing results when using link in bio in caption vs not\" width=\"901\" height=\"582\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/link-in-bio-captions-study.webp 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/link-in-bio-captions-study-480x310.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1330069\/instagram-engagement-rate-posts-link-in-bio-by-type\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This makes sense\u2014remember, Meta wants to keep its users on the platform. So to drive traffic from Instagram, you need to work with the social media platform.<\/p>\n<div id=\"post-high-quality-content-often\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Post high-quality content often<\/h3>\n<p>The Instagram algorithm favors accounts that post high-quality content often. So to get in front of as many eyes as possible, you\u2019ll need an active and appealing Instagram presence.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/how-often-post-to-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Later<\/a> analyzed 19 million Instagram posts as well as 34,000 Instagram Stories and found that the frequency of posting on Instagram depends on the number of followers. Here are their findings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nano accounts (0-10K followers) post an average of three Instagram Stories and two feed posts per week.<\/li>\n<li>Micro accounts (10K-100K followers) post an average of four Instagram Stories and three feed posts per week.<\/li>\n<li>Mid accounts (100K-500K followers) post an average of 15 Instagram Stories and five feed posts per week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use this as a guideline to plan your posting schedule. Remember, high-quality content doesn\u2019t mean high production value or even net new ideas. In general, Instagram loves videos, behind-the-scenes content, people with their faces in the frame, captions for voiceovers, and limited text. But if you\u2019re looking to get more creative, well, that brings us to our next tip.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Get engaging copy-and-paste Instagram posts for the whole year in our <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download\">free social media template<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"experiment-with-instagram-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Experiment with your content<\/h3>\n<p>A good way to engage more people and encourage more website visits is to experiment with new types of content on Instagram, particularly the platform\u2019s interactive features. Here are a few types to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Polls: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Running a poll on Instagram<\/a> is simple. You select the sticker option for your Story and then wait for your audience to weigh in. Instagram encourages engagement in this type of content because you can\u2019t see the results without voting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q&amp;A boxes: <\/strong>This is another Story sticker, but this one encourages individual submissions from your audience. Running a Q&amp;A gives you a chance to dialogue with your followers\u2014talk about the company, explain product features, and even respond to hard-hitting questions like Carrie or Samantha. In the answers, if it\u2019s relevant, you can link to your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Giveaways:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-giveaways\">Giveaways<\/a> are an excellent way to attract and engage an audience, and that\u2019s true on Instagram, too. Content about a giveaway receives <a href=\"https:\/\/keyhole.co\/blog\/instagram-giveaway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.5X <\/a>as many likes as other posts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Lives: <\/strong>These are live sessions where you can talk directly to your community, who have access to a real-time chat. This content can be saved in a grid post, too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reels: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Reels<\/a> are videos up to 90 seconds that can include music, filters, and text. These videos aren\u2019t interactive, but compared to posts and Stories, Reels generate more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialinsider.io\/data-geeks\/Instagram_content_performance_study_2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2X<\/a> the number of impressions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"customize-links\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Customize your links<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been an Instagram user for a few years, you remember the clunky option to swipe up on a link that was only available to businesses or influencers. In the <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/expanding-sharing-links-in-stories-to-everyone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fall of 2021<\/a>, Instagram allowed all accounts to include links in Stories as stickers. The functionality of the link sticker is so much better for all users\u2014including your brand.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re adding links to your stories, take the time to customize your links. This could be as simple as changing the text to a descriptive CTA like \u201cSign Up,\u201d or \u201cRead.\u201d Or you could add a graphic or even a textbox overlay to match the design to your branding.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a couple of examples from influencer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marylauren\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mary Lauren<\/a>, who shares home design and renovation content, as well as style tips. The text overlay is simple but effective, making the link fit her content\u2019s aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mary-lauren-instagram-links.webp\" alt=\"example of customized links in instagram Stories\" width=\"502\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mary-lauren-instagram-links.webp 502w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mary-lauren-instagram-links-480x551.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for more creative options to customize your links, you can create graphics to use for your brand\u2019s account. Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N26zGtilArY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tutorial<\/a> to get started.<\/p>\n<div id=\"collaborate-with-influencers\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Collaborate with influencers<\/h3>\n<p>Another excellent way to expand your brand\u2019s reach on Instagram is to collaborate with relevant influencers on the platform. If the insanely high sticker price for celebrity posts\u2014like the <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/instagram-highest-paid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$2M per post<\/a> brands pay Kim Kardashian\u2014-is out of your budget, you can opt for influencers with smaller followings. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/influencer-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprout Social<\/a>, you can expect to pay about $10 per 1,000 followers. In this case, you want to find a sweet spot between maximizing reach and maintaining your budget.<\/p>\n<p>In that case, you\u2019re often better off with an influencer who has a smaller, more niche following. For instance, if you\u2019ve just opened a food truck in New Hampshire, it might make more sense to partner with a smaller, focused account like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/whatsnewinnh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What\u2019s New In NH<\/a> with around 45,000 followers than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sistersnacking\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sisters Snacking<\/a>, which has nearly 500,000 but covers all of New England, New Jersey, and New York, with a bulk of content in NYC and Boston.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers.webp\" alt=\"example of account partnering with influencers to drive traffic from instagram\" width=\"678\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers.webp 678w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers-480x425.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>NH, nowhere to be seen in the grid view for Sisters Snacking.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Just make sure the link you\u2019re pushing in the sponsored content is targeted to the influencer\u2019s audience, like a custom <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> or a specific product page.<\/p>\n<div id=\"save-stories-to-highlights\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Save important Stories to your highlights<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram Stories expire after 24 hours. But when you\u2019re taking time to create high-quality content, you want to make the most it\u2014-and maximize the potential traffic to your website. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to save important stories to your highlights.<\/p>\n<p>The types of Stories that belong in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/06\/instagram-story-highlights\">highlights<\/a> depend on your brand. If your brand is an ecommerce company, you\u2019ll want stories that feature your products with links to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/01\/product-pages\">product pages<\/a>. If you\u2019re offering a service, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have links to client testimonials or your portfolio as well as links to book an appointment.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photographer-instagram-profile-example.webp\" alt=\"example of instagram photographer with customized highlights\" width=\"878\" height=\"482\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photographer-instagram-profile-example.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photographer-instagram-profile-example-480x264.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photographer Michelle K. Martin\u2019s highlights feature examples of her work, and the booking highlight includes a link to book directly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to track interactions with the content in your highlights. After stories expire, the visibility into likes and views does, too. But saving a story to your highlight doesn\u2019t take too long\u2014and, plus, it\u2019s a nice opportunity to build out your brand\u2019s profile.<\/p>\n<div id=\"update-bio-links-regularly\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Update your bio links regularly<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone looking at your brand\u2019s links in your posts and highlights will see the date they were originally posted. So if there\u2019s a link to a product from 111 weeks ago that doesn\u2019t work, they won\u2019t hold it against you. They might be disappointed that the item is out of stock or frustrated with a 404, but they know that the link is old.<\/p>\n<p>If they\u2019re clicking the link in your bio and hitting the same problems, though? That\u2019s an issue. If you\u2019re including promotions, discounts, limited products\u2014anything that can expire\u2014in your bio, you need to check regularly to make sure it\u2019s up to date.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/az-small-business-association-instagram-links.webp\" alt=\"example of instagram account using timely links in bio to drive traffic from instagram\" width=\"783\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/az-small-business-association-instagram-links.webp 783w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/az-small-business-association-instagram-links-480x368.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 783px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Arizona Small Business Association has a timely poll in its bio, but it\u2019s not out of date yet.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"grow-instagram-following\"><\/div>\n<h3>9.
