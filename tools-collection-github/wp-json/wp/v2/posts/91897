And, if you have an incentive program for the service provider based on positive reviews, you can also mention that to help encourage the customer to leave a positive review. Again, asking on-site, in person, with a device ready to go to make it as easy as possible will greatly increase your odds of receiving a positive review.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been in business a long time and have a database of customer information, you can also put together a strategy for going back through your existing and previous customer lists and asking for reviews.<\/p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"posts-photos-and-qna-sections\"><\/div>\n<h3>Posts, photos, and Q&amp;A sections<\/h3>\n<p>Having specific elements of your profile frequently updated and making those updates specific to your target services and service areas can improve your GBP rankings for specific phrases in specific areas. Two major opportunities here are photos and posts:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-business-profile-photos-updates.webp\"

100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Regardless of your business, you can find new opportunities to create updates (daily is frequently a good cadence) and add new photos to your profile, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For service-based businesses, jobs you\u2019ve completed, including information about the location of the job.<\/li>\n<li>For a restaurant, photos of your restaurant, food you\u2019re making, patrons enjoying your food (with permission of course).<\/li>\n<li>For a dentist\u2019s office, photos of your facility, equipment, before and after photos, happy customers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also post updates about local businesses you partner with, updates on your business, jobs you\u2019re completing, customer profiles, profiles of your employees, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, building out and periodically updating your Q&amp;A section of your profile with relevant questions and answers is another means of keeping your profile fresh and comprehensive.<\/p>\n<p>Consistently updating your photos and posts and making sure that you\u2019re mentioning the services you offer, along with the areas you\u2019re servicing, helps you show up in response to relevant searches.<\/p>\n<div id=\"offers-and-events\"><\/div>\n<h3>Offers and events<\/h3>\n<p>Similarly, adding information about events you\u2019re having and special offers you\u2019re running helps you get specific search results real estate for your business.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to \u201cfake\u201d offers, and this may not be applicable to every small business, but if you run specials and host events, it\u2019s smart to make sure those are represented consistently on your GBP profile.<\/p>\n<div id=\"performance-metrics\"><\/div>\n<h3>Performance metrics<\/h3>\n<p>You should be using multiple tools (Google Analytics 4, Search Console, and call and lead tracking software) to track your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-seo-in-2024\">local SEO efforts<\/a>, but the performance report in GBP gives you specific access to data about your profile, like interactions, calls, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Some of this data can be found in other tools, but it\u2019s helpful to understand how visitors are interacting with your profile and to make sure your optimization efforts are growing desired actions (particularly calls, bookings, and website clicks).<\/p>\n<p><img

900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"specialized-gbp-features\"><\/div>\n<h3>Specialized GBP features<\/h3>\n<p>Many of the features above apply to several or even all locally focused businesses, but several GBP features are specific to certain types of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to be aware of these if you\u2019re a business owner or marketing professional in one of those categories.<\/p>\n<div id=\"booking\"><\/div>\n<h4>Booking<\/h4>\n<p>Bookings allow your customers to book directly from your GBP&#8211;if you\u2019re showing up prominently and getting views of your profile, this could be a great way to get customers who don\u2019t want to engage via phone or your website to book an appointment with you right online.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-business-profile-booking.webp\" alt=\"google business profile booking feature\" width=\"640\" height=\"417\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91909\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-business-profile-booking.webp 640w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-business-profile-booking-480x313.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand, however, that you need to be able to accommodate and respond to booking inquiries. If you\u2019re using a third-party system to manage your bookings, you can find out if they integrate with GBP by looking at Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/reserve\/partners?ihs=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cReserve with Google\u201d integration list<\/a> to see if your provider is listed (and can even request an addition if they\u2019re not yet).<\/p>\n<div id=\"products\"><\/div>\n<h4>Products<\/h4>\n<p>You can also list products on your GBP&#8211;even if you\u2019re a service provider (e.g., if you\u2019re a salon that also sells select hair care or beauty products).<\/p>\n<p>When adding products, you want to optimize them as you would any product listing: have compelling photos and product descriptions, include deep links to the place on your site where they can purchase the product, and keep information on your GBP accurate and up to date (pricing, availability, etc).<\/p>\n<div id=\"api-and-multi-location-tools\"><\/div>\n<h4>API and multi-location tools<\/h4>\n<p>If you have multiple locations, you can use tools like adding a store code or a label to your profile. You can also access the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/my-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">API<\/a> if you have specialized needs and access to a developer.<\/p>\n<p>Google also offers integration with other tools&#8211;such as Google Ads&#8211;which can be valuable if you\u2019re running ads or want the data from your GBP piped into a reporting tool you\u2019re using.<\/p>\n<div id=\"menu-updates\"><\/div>\n<h4>Menu updates<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to bookings and products, GBP allows restaurants to make menu updates. That\u2019s not relevant if you\u2019re not a restaurant. Still, it\u2019s a great opportunity to both show in response to specific searches (e.g., \u201cthe best cheeseburger near me\u201d) and give potential customers more information about pricing and what you offer.<\/p>\n<h2>How to think about Google Business Profile features<\/h2>\n<p>Google offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfK7mx2knZUBZYE9iGB4AN6uRKawYfMP5NbGFhGU4PX3QONRg\/viewform?visit_id=638826603544046897-2053364266&amp;p=subscribe&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monthly newsletter<\/a> that includes feature updates <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/thread\/343006067\/what-s-new-in-google-business-profile-may-2025?hl=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like these<\/a> each month and has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/googlebusinessprofile\/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube channel<\/a> dedicated to Google Business Profile updates and tutorials.<\/p>\n<p>As Google introduces new features and tools like AI writing assistants, it\u2019s useful to keep in mind a few things as you determine which makes the most sense for your business:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be fresh and comprehensive<\/strong>. Generally, having your information updated frequently and filling out your profile as completely as possible is the best way to show up more frequently. So as niche-specific features are rolled out, it\u2019s usually worthwhile to take the time to complete them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remember that tools aren\u2019t features<\/strong>. While it\u2019s generally a good idea to make sure your information is accurate, to use features like posts or niche-specific features like menus when they\u2019re relevant to you, you don\u2019t need to make use of every AI tool Google rolls out. Often, those tools are made available for businesses who wouldn\u2019t complete their profiles otherwise, and you or someone on your team may be able to write better descriptions, fill in information more accurately, etc. Just because Google offers a specific tool doesn\u2019t mean you have to leverage it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Monitor news, filter noise<\/strong>. It\u2019s great to stay on top of features and push relevant, localized information about your business to those features, but you also don\u2019t need to keep track of every minute update Google makes that doesn\u2019t apply specifically to your business.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And generally, approach your Google Business Profile like your website or even your storefront: it\u2019s an asset that can help introduce and connect you with customers and potential customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Focus on these Google Business Profile features to make your listing pop
