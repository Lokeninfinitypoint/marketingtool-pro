So you&#8217;ll need to select the one with the greatest impact or the biggest degree of accuracy since you only get one option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you decide you need to change the conversion value rules you have for a conversion action, you\u2019ll have to delete the old value rule and create a new one. All previous conversion value data will remain, but the new augmentation will be applied to all conversions moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Second, conversion value rules are only additive with very limited control for decreasing the value of a conversion. As you can see below, if you try to add a negative number in the add or multiply field, you\u2019re given an error.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/conversion-value-rules-limitations.jpg\" alt=\"conversion value rules - adjusting for lower value conversions error\" width=\"745\" height=\"176\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79208 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/conversion-value-rules-limitations.jpg 745w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/conversion-value-rules-limitations-480x113.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 745px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>The only way to adjust a conversion value down is evident in the image above: you can add multipliers of less than 1 to an action, meaning you could cut a conversion value down by 50%, or half of its original value. This is possible for any adjustment between 0.5 and 0.99.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>That said, it seems this tactic is mostly intended for incremental adjustments up, not down. If you find that a large group of your converters are worth less than your current value and the limitations with conversion value rules don\u2019t allow you to fully reflect that discount, it may make more sense to adjust the value in the conversion tracking section, then use value rules to highlight the more valuable exceptions rather than to devalue the other group. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span>How to know if conversion value rules are right for your business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>Conversion value rules can help you better track the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ROAS of your Google Ads campaigns<\/a> by incrementally increasing the associated conversion value based on a handful of conditions. These can be adjusted to your will and changed any time, but are designed to leverage both your knowledge of your customers and Google\u2019s machine learning to help you get more value out of your account. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re not able to track dynamic conversion values but are certain of some audiences, geographics, or device categories that are more valuable to your business, these can be a great way to better reflect the success of your campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hippowiz-ass-injected\" value=\"true\" \/><input type=\"hidden\"
