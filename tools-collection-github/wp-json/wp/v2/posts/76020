In other words, it reduces the chances you\u2019re spending precious time writing content nobody will read\u2014a fate worse than death for any writer!<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes, content optimization is thought of in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search engine optimization<\/a> (SEO) terms. In this case, content optimization involves keyword research, on-page optimization, and more with the goal of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking in search engines<\/a> for relevant queries. But there\u2019s also content optimization for social media, sales enablement, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/11\/increase-conversion-rates\">general conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the type or reason for optimizing content, the end objective is often the same: tweak your content in a way that helps you reach your goals.<\/p>\n<div id=\"why\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why content optimization matters<\/h2>\n<p>Time is money, as the old saying goes. When you\u2019re not optimizing your content for one goal or another, you\u2019re increasing the chances you\u2019re wasting time (and money). On the other hand, when you optimize content, you\u2019re setting yourself up for success with multiple benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>Your content is more likely to rank<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s always a chance a quality piece of content with absolutely no attention paid to optimization ends up performing well on Google. If you optimize your content, though, you\u2019re increasing your chances of ranking.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>\ud83d\udc4b <\/strong>Content optimization is one way to drive more traffic.

Google algorithms change over time and competition can shift. This can result in your content that was once dominating page one, falling into oblivion.<\/p>\n<p>An added perk, content reoptimization, or content refreshes, are often much quicker than writing a piece from scratch. Who doesn\u2019t want to save time and possibly land a nice spot on Google?<\/p>\n<h3>You can get your content in front of the right people<\/h3>\n<p>You likely know who your audience is, as well as what it is they want.

There are a number of content optimization strategies you can launch, but keep in mind some of them may make more sense for your content or brand at your current stage.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use keywords strategically<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword\">Keywords<\/a> help search engines match your content to the queries people enter. To make sure Google and its competitors know that your content will answer their users\u2019 questions, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">research which keywords<\/a> to target, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/keyword-mapping\">map your keywords<\/a>, and add them to your content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-keyword.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - keyword placement\" width=\"872\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76029 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-keyword.jpg 872w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-keyword-480x328.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you write, ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the keyword in the intro paragraph?<\/li>\n<li>Is the keyword in at least one major header?<\/li>\n<li>Is the keyword in the title?<\/li>\n<li>Is the keyword in the meta description?<\/li>\n<li>Is the keyword contained in the page URL?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tip<\/strong>: Avoid keyword stuffing! SEO has come a long way since the dark ages of the 2010s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/21\/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing\">Keyword stuffing<\/a> is obvious to readers and isn\u2019t doing your SEO any favors. Make your keyword mentions organic, but never excessive.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Include meta descriptions and title tags<\/h3>\n<p>Like keywords, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">meta tags<\/a> are an important part of on-page SEO. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">Meta descriptions<\/a> and title tags are types of meta tags that show up on search engine results pages.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-meta.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - screenshot of meta data on google\" width=\"930\" height=\"215\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76030 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-meta.jpg 930w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-meta-480x111.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 930px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since they\u2019re visible to searchers, these meta tags are critical to content optimization. Make sure your meta titles and meta descriptions include target keywords and are engaging enough to get people to click on your search entry.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Ensure your site is technically sound<\/h3>\n<p>All the optimization in the world won\u2019t save your articles from a site that\u2019s not technically up to par. This is where technical optimization, the cousin of on-page and off-page, comes into play.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-technical.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - diagram of the three components of SEO\" width=\"686\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76031 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-technical.jpg 686w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-technical-480x419.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 686px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Technical SEO is (surprise, surprise) far more technical than on-page optimization. To get started, do a general checkup of your site and run it through a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/?utm_source=psi&amp;utm_medium=redirect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google PageSpeed Insights<\/a>. This will tell you if your site loads quickly, and if there are any glaring issues.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to consider if your site is indexed, crawlable by Google, and more. Cover all your technical bases with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">our technical SEO audit guide<\/a>, and get your site up to technical speed in no time.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Create internal links to relevant content (and vice versa)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\">External links<\/a>, those from other websites, are great for helping your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a> and chances of ranking. As you create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">quality content<\/a> and build your brand, these links will come. But, it\u2019s still important to build out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal links<\/a> between your content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-links.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - screenshot showing an internal link\" width=\"936\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76033 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-links.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-links-480x231.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re creating a new piece from scratch or performing a refresh, go through your site and include links to your new piece within older content (from a relevant spot). Then, do the same for your new piece and link out to other pieces you have, using relevant copy as anchor text.<\/p>\n<p>Internal linking not only helps your SEO, it also provides a better experience for your readers. If someone has a question about something you\u2019re covering, and you have the term linked to a helpful guide, they can easily get the information they need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip<\/strong>: Create a spreadsheet that tracks your articles and target terms with a column that indicates whether you\u2019ve linked from one relevant article to another. It\u2019s easy to lose track of what pieces are linking where, and a spreadsheet goes a long way.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Break up the copy for a better reading experience<\/h3>\n<p>Nobody likes clicking a link only to find themselves face-to-face with a wall of text. Massive articles with no visuals or breaks in the copy will likely drive your audience away, and quickly. This hurts your bounce rate and ultimately your chances of ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an article we recently published about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/15\/youtube-algorithm\">YouTube algorithm<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-breakup.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - screenshot of a blog post \" width=\"355\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76035 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-breakup.jpg 355w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-breakup-185x300.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how the text is broken up by headers, images, and callouts? That\u2019s so our readers can get a break from reading. It also lets people skim an article and jump into the parts that interest them the most.<\/p>\n<p>Again, whether you\u2019re writing a new article or refreshing an old one, make sure you\u2019re giving the reader breaks in the copy. Images are a great way to keep an article flowing, and they provide their own <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/benefits-of-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO benefits<\/a>. You can also use bulleted lists, numbered lists, block quotes, and more to keep the article flowing.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBreak up your text with bulleted lists, images, videos, or even block quotes like this one. See how easy that is?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 John Shieldsmith, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Complete Hack<\/span> Writer<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As an added bonus, breaking up the copy simply makes your content more pleasant to read.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Double-check search intent before writing<\/h3>\n<p>Just because a keyword looks promising, doesn\u2019t mean the intent is the right fit for your brand. This is why it\u2019s important to search a term on Google before you start targeting it in a piece, otherwise, you risk wasting precious time writing an article that won\u2019t perform well.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say you want to educate your audience about pepperoni, seeing as you run an online frozen pizza company. While \u201cbest pepperoni\u201d might sound ideal, especially considering you\u2019re writing a guide on how to make the best pepperoni, this isn\u2019t the case. Searching the term brings up a number of commercial articles, all ranking the best pepperoni brands.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-intent.jpg\" alt=\"Content optimization - screenshot of a googe results page\" width=\"442\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76036 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-intent.jpg 442w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Content-optimization-example-intent-221x300.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By proceeding with the guide and using that term, you\u2019re setting the article up to disappoint readers who click the link, as they\u2019d likely be looking for the best pepperoni brand. This will hurt your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate\">bounce rate<\/a> and again, torpedo your chances of ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your intent is in line with your audience before you write a single word, using our well-intentioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">expert guide on keyword intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use relevant images<\/h3>\n<p>Images keep your articles engaging but also help your chances of ranking. This is especially true when you use the right images, as they\u2019ll keep your audience engaged. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">image best practices<\/a> don\u2019t stop there.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include your own screenshots when possible, as these build credibility with your audience and further establish you in the space.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t use an image for the sake of using an image. Images should help drive home a point, further inform a reader, or entertain at the least.<\/li>\n<li>Keep an eye on your number of images. Too many images can bog down your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/24\/page-speed\">page speed<\/a> and impact your SEO.<\/li>\n<li>Compress images using one of the many free tools available. Images should stay right around 100kb, ideally. Anything over that risks slowing your site down. However, your hero image can be a bit larger, along with infographics, as these are top-priority images.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tip<\/strong>: Run your page through the aforementioned Google PageSpeed Insights and see how quickly it loads. If you\u2019re not happy with the speed, make sure your images are compressed and that you\u2019re not using too many.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Use attention-grabbing videos<\/h3>\n<p>Follow the same image best practices and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/10\/social-media-video-marketing\">include relevant videos<\/a> when you can. Videos further break up your copy while appealing to other learning and engagement styles.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that if you\u2019re using a video player and not auto-playing a video, you don\u2019t have to worry about the file size. If you\u2019re embedding the video and loading it straight from your own server, file size can come into play.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Prioritize your audience above all else<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, your audience is the most important element to consider when writing and optimizing. Put yourself in your reader\u2019s shoes and ask yourself if the article answers whatever question or questions they had when searching the term. Will they walk away from the piece, their life better in some way?<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re finished with your piece, ask yourself if the article is something you\u2019re proud to have your name, or your brand, on.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Hey there!
