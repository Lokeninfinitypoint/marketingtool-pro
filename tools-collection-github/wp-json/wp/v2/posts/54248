Consumers want to do business with people, not businesses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invest in design tools:\u00a0<\/strong>With tools like Canva, the bar for &#8220;good&#8221; visual content has been raised.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t give up on Facebook ads:\u00a0<\/strong>Despite the challenges brought on by iOS 14, Facebook continues to be a lucrative option for businesses, and we&#8217;ve got the tips for you to make the most of it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have a review strategy:\u00a0<\/strong>Whether you&#8217;re a local shop or enterprise, brick and mortar or ecommerce, reviews are the key to ranking higher in searches and getting more customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Firm up your entertaining side: <\/strong>TikTok has led social media algorithms elsewhere to favor entertaining content. This means video and humor\u2014and you can still be educational with this style.<\/li>\n<li><strong>First-party data:\u00a0<\/strong>Use lead magnets and lead ads to collect information directly from your audience that you won&#8217;t be able to get once third-party cookies are completely gone.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Our greatest search engine marketing tips<\/h2>\n<p>Tons of Google Ads updates this year, which you can read about (and get even more tips from) in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/07\/top-ppc-stories-2021\">biggest PPC stories roundup<\/a>.

Before RSAs become the only search ad type you can create (in June 2022), activate RSAs in all ad groups of all your search campaigns now so you can establish new benchmarks. And remember, asset performance rating is not tied to conversion performance. You&#8217;ll need to use pinning to get more firm data on conversions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/02\/responsive-search-ad-tips\">Get more RSA tips here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Install the Google Tag Assistant plugin: <\/strong>If your conversion data isn&#8217;t showing and you can&#8217;t find a smoking gun in your change history or the Conversions section, this plugin will tell you which tags are present on a landing page, if there are any errors, and make recommendations for improvement.
