These tips will help you find your competitive positioning now and stay on top of it as it evolves.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Ensure you know the market<\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, you need to know where you fit in the market.<\/p>\n<p>Start by running a market analysis. Review the landscape and note how many competitors are out there, what the potential market size and customer base look like, and what the average revenue is for businesses in this space. It\u2019s also not a bad idea to conduct a tried-and-true <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/16\/marketing-competitive-analysis#_ga=2.182940582.1090122938.1698345807-369991937.1695347762&amp;_gac=1.158025416.1695698446.CjwKCAjw38SoBhB6EiwA8EQVLu7t5v3dzfKLQDhndyDc4IcBctoDyLNeIkf8BMcvXfejZz5caP-EUBoCAG4QAvD_BwE\">SWOT analysis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot.webp\" alt=\"competitive positioning - swot analysis chart.\" width=\"787\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84678 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot.webp 787w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot-480x366.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is also a good time to start thinking about your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">ideal customer persona<\/a> (ICP). Who is your ideal customer? What are their likes and dislikes? What are their major pain points? What about your product or service would appeal to them?<\/p>\n<p>If your business is already off the ground, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-feedback-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polling your current customers<\/a> to gain useful insights grounded in reality.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Perform in-depth competitor research<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knowing your competitors<\/a> is as important as knowing your own company and market, if not more.<\/p>\n<p>Perform in-depth competitor research to find out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are the biggest competitors in your space?<\/li>\n<li>What do their customers like about their offerings?<\/li>\n<li>What are the biggest customer complaints about their offerings?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any gaps your product or services fill or could fill?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>During this phase, pay special attention to customer complaints and any gaps you find. If the majority of competitors are receiving similar complaints about a product or a lack of an offering, this is a golden opportunity for you.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say you run an online shoe store. If your direct competitors are all receiving negative marks about their return policy, you could position yourself as the \u201ccustomer-centric\u201d shoe store and offer a better return policy with a free trial period.<\/p>\n<h3>3. List out your objectives<\/h3>\n<p>Your positioning isn\u2019t only affected by your company\u2019s current status but also by your future plans and objectives. This is especially the case when fulfilling your objectives could result in your company pivoting in a big way.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your quarterly goal is to launch two marketing campaigns, this isn\u2019t necessarily a pivotal moment for your company. If you have a fiscal year goal of launching a new product, that is something you should factor into your positioning.<\/p>\n<p>Gather any relevant stakeholders and list out all your short and long-term goals and objectives. Then, review the list and determine which ones have the potential to impact your company\u2019s positioning. Take note of these goals and factor them in as you move forward with the rest of this guide.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Lean into your niche<\/h3>\n<p>A core part of determining what makes you competitive is finding your niche and leaning in on it as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Start by reflecting on your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-analysis\"> competitive analysis<\/a> and your own products and positioning. Then, think about your key differences and list them.<\/p>\n<p>Next, list every problem your target audience has that you intend to solve. Be realistic and only call attention to problems you can solve in the near future without any significant funding or company overhaul.<\/p>\n<p>With your competitor knowledge and list of target problems, now it\u2019s time to identify what makes you different. Figure this out by answering the following questions in as much detail as you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the problems only you can solve?<\/li>\n<li>What is your company strongest at?<\/li>\n<li>What gaps can you realistically fill?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Answering the above questions will ultimately help you determine your niche\u2014the position only your company and product(s) can fill.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use gaps to define your competitive positioning<\/h3>\n<p>Once you understand your customers and competitors, it\u2019s time to use that knowledge to position your brand and products competitively.<\/p>\n<p>You do that by looking for gaps in customer needs that your competitors don\u2019t fulfill.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Let\u2019s say all of your competitors provide a luxury experience at premium prices that solve the needs of high-income clients. In your customer research, you\u2019ve identified a large segment of buyers who don\u2019t use their service because of the price point but would if it were more accessible. So, you design a simplified \u201cno frills\u201d version and capture an underserved pool of eager buyers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-is-a-competitive-positioning-map\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is a competitive positioning map?<\/h2>\n<p>A competitive positioning map is a graph that positions competitors along two variables. It\u2019s designed to help you visualize gaps in the market for those two characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a competitive positioning map is a three-step process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick two variables, like cost (high vs. low), service level (self-serve vs. concierge), or features (full-feature vs. simple design).<\/li>\n<li>Plot where each of your competitors falls for each of those two variables.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Look for the gaps in service.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"your-competitive-positioning-map\"><\/div>\n<h2>Competitive positioning map example<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a competitive positioning map you can use to create your own.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map.webp\" alt=\"competitive positioning - Template of a competitive positioning map\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84679 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Competitive positioning is a process, not a conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>As you embark on your competitive journey, keep in mind your positioning is unlikely to be set in stone. Audience likes and dislikes change, competitors rebrand and launch new products, and your own products and branding can evolve. Because of this, it\u2019s a good idea to reevaluate your competitive positioning every year or anytime you have a major brand or product overhaul.<\/p>\n<p>While you won\u2019t find your competitive positioning overnight, the aforementioned steps will get you well on your way to knowing where your company stands in the market\u2014a major step toward long-term success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Use this guide to competitive positioning to show the world why your business is unique.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":265,"featured_media":84680,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[102],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-84676","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-business-strategy"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What Is Competitive Positioning?
