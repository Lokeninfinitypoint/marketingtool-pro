Most often, we see sites with issues like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legacy JavaScript:<\/strong> This may be from a tool you no longer use, or some code that a developer added to your site previously that the site no longer needs\u2014this is a great opportunity because it \u201ccosts\u201d you nothing in terms of the site\u2019s performance and helps speed things up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Render blocking:<\/strong> Often, your site may have a specific tool (like tracking tools or some specific code) that isn\u2019t needed for the visitor to see your site immediately, but that you want to load eventually. You can load those elements later in the process and create a much better experience for visitors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These opportunities vary from site to site, but for most small businesses, there will be some opportunities like this.<\/p>\n<p>Improving load times is especially valuable because it can also help your site\u2019s conversion rates.<\/p>\n<div id=\"click-through-rate-improvements\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Click-through rate improvements<\/h3>\n<p>Having pages\u2014particularly your most popular pages\u2014that are frequently clicked on when visitors see them in search results will have a major impact on your rankings.<\/p>\n<p>The percentage of times searchers click on your website listings is your click-through rate, and you want to optimize this for key pages and for all of your pages. Your main opportunities here are a page\u2019s meta title tag, and its meta description:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp\" alt=\"seo ranking factors - meta description example to increase ctr\" width=\"900\" height=\"308\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ranking-factors-click-through-rates-480x164.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How do you know what to include in the page title and meta description? Think of it like you would ad text in a pay-per-click ad:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understand basic marketing<\/strong>: Does your title and description satisfy the search queries that <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive the most traffic<\/a> to the relevant page? What is the searcher really looking for? Try to find a way to:\n<ol>\n<li>Promise that thing.<\/li>\n<li>Do it in a way that\u2019s differentiated from other sites.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure you deliver on that on the page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at the SERP<\/strong>: A good place to look for ideas is in the search result itself. What is the title tag of sites ranking higher than yours? There may be multiple reasons those sites rank, so don\u2019t just copy their titles and descriptions blindly, but it may give you some food for thought.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use AI tools<\/strong>: Title tags and meta descriptions are an area where tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\">ChatGPT<\/a> or Perplexity are very good at ideation and giving you possible formats you can use. Give the tool as much information as you can (your title tag, the title tags of other pages that rank, the search terms your page shows up for, etc.).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include your own data:<\/strong> Look in Google Search Console at your own pages. If there are specific pages that get a particularly high click-through rate (outside of your homepage, which likely does well because of branded traffic to your site), the title tag you use there may be a strong one to consider for other, similar pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Along those lines, if you have a site that\u2019s getting a few hundred or even a few thousand visitors a month, you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of time optimizing title tags and meta descriptions throughout your site. Focus on the few pages getting the most traffic from search, and the formula for collections of pages.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you have a music lessons site with a series of local pages targeting terms like piano lessons in Kalamazoo, piano lessons in Portage, etc., look at the click-through rates for those pages, look at the ideas you have for the most highly trafficked pages there, and make changes across those pages and measure accordingly. You can do this periodically as well\u2014probably every six months or so.<\/p>\n<p>The more traffic your site and individual pages have, the more it makes sense to spend more time optimizing CTR and titles and descriptions.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"branded-search\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Branded search<\/h3>\n<p>Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/googles-branded-search-patent-for-ranking-search-results\/524083\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">patents<\/a> for using branded search traffic as a proxy for how trusted a site should be. This can be a difficult thing to \u201coptimize\u201d for, but some ways to think about this include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PR.<\/strong> Traditional PR and getting featured in the publications your prospects read most often is a great way to get people to search for your brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Signage, trucks, etc.<\/strong> Having signage for your business, wrapping trucks if you have a business where those are in the wild, etc., is another way to drive branded search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Partnerships.<\/strong> Partnering with relevant businesses (in the case of a local business, this could be other businesses in your area, particularly those that your best prospects would be likely to use\u2014e.g., if you offer music lessons, a local musical instrument store, or even different companies offering kids\u2019 activities).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp\" alt=\"example of a branded search\" width=\"872\" height=\"607\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp 872w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/branded-search-ranking-factor-480x334.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are similar advantages to increasing branded search to improving page speed, in that you\u2019re getting more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a> generally and helping your business, not just your search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>One note here: While Google has explicitly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/unlinked-citations-google-rankings-29490.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said<\/a> that branded mentions that aren\u2019t links are not a ranking factor, there is evidence that these help power your visibility in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-ai-tools\">AI tools<\/a> like ChatGPT, Claude, etc., and that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-citations\">citations<\/a> help with local rankings if you have a business focused on local SEO.<\/p>\n<div id=\"content-relevance\"><\/div>\n<h3>6.

For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/US7716225B1\/en#:~:text=higher%20probability%20of%20being%20selected,or%20combinations%20of%20feature%20data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Google patent on ranking documents<\/a> notes that \u201c<em>when a topical cluster associated with the source document is related to a topical cluster associated with the target document, the link has a higher probability of being selected.<\/em>\u201d In other words, links between pages on the same topic (same topical cluster) are considered more likely (and thus more valuable) than links between unrelated pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internal links are important:<\/strong> In another Google patent on onsite ranking, Google describes how links from pages within the same site signal importance. It <a href=\"https:\/\/patents.google.com\/patent\/US8843477B1\/en#:~:text=computers,include%20the%20number%20of%20keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explains<\/a> that if \u201c<em>numerous other web pages associated with the same domain contain links to that particular web page, the web page may be of greater importance within the domain compared to other web pages.<\/em>\u201d This underscores that pages heavily linked by other pages on the same site (often topically related pages) are treated as more central within that site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It helps to merge related pages:<\/strong> Google\u2019s John Mueller has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/combining-web-pages\/276633\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spoken about<\/a> combining related pages to improve relevance. He explained that if you merge several weaker pages on a common topic into one, the resulting page becomes \u201c<strong>a stronger page<\/strong>\u201d because <em>\u201cmore parts of the site are referring to this one single piece of content, so it\u2019s probably more relevant than those individual small pieces you had before.\u201d <\/em>This reflects that internally linking and consolidating semantically related content boosts that content\u2019s perceived relevance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A topic focus is essential:<\/strong> Mueller also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/combining-web-pages\/276633\/#:~:text=,topic%20of%20this%20page%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cautioned against combining unrelated content<\/a>. He noted that merging \u201ctwo completely separate pages\u201d on different topics forces Google to ask <em>\u201cWhat\u2019s the primary topic of this page?\u201d<\/em> This implies Google expects a clear, focused topic per page (and by extension per site section), suggesting a site should group similar topics rather than mix them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\ude98 Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"content-accessibility\"><\/div>\n<h3>7.
