There are easily thousands of other companies <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">in your niche<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>How do you differentiate?<\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s new Messenger Ads give us the ability to reach customers instantly. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/products\/messenger-for-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Facebook<\/a>, they\u2019ve already been shown to increase conversions and response rates.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are Facebook Messenger Ads, and why should you care? How do you use Messenger Ads to drive sales, increase conversions, and qualify leads?<\/p>\n<p>Here are four things you need to know about Facebook Messenger Ads, plus some tips on how you can set them up today in just a few minutes.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Facebook Messenger Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads are a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/17\/best-online-advertising-features\">relatively new ad feature<\/a> that allow users who see your ads to initiate a text conversation with your business with the click of a button. Facebook currently offers a few different types of Messenger Ads:<\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Destination ads<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored messages<\/li>\n<li>Home section ads<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These are all designed for advertisers to start conversations with users and drive interactions and sales (plus, they can be used to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/26\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14\">generate leads on Facebook post-iOS 14<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The destination style Messenger Ads show in your Facebook newsfeed like a typical ad, but the objective is vastly different.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of a typical call to action like \u201cShop Now,\u201d users see \u201cSend Message\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what-are-facebook-messenger-ads.jpg\" alt=\"what are facebook messenger ads\" width=\"400\" height=\"721\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Where a normal ad would send people directly to a landing page, this Messenger-style ad will engage customers without directly asking them to buy \u2013 meaning you don\u2019t have to scare away cold, non-brand-aware users with a heavy ask.<\/p>\n<p>The second ad type is called a sponsored message. These ads allow you to deliver specifically crafted messages directly to a user&#8217;s inbox:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-sponsored-message-ads.jpg\" alt=\"facebook sponsored messages\" width=\"700\" height=\"690\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great tool for driving strategic engagements and actions relating to your business while keeping a user on the platform and reducing the risk of a bounce.<\/p>\n<p>The last type of ad that works for Messenger shows up directly in the home dashboard of your messaging application:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ad-types.jpg\" alt=\"facebook messenger ad types\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/348296675602862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The main use of these ads is pretty simple: To generate real, organic conversations with your customers. You know, to actually interact with them rather than treating them like another user on your list.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve made initial contact, you have the opportunity to personalize your customer service and tailor the experience for each user.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/personalized-messenger-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"personalized facebook messenger ad examples\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/products\/messenger-for-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The results speak for themselves. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globe.com.ph\/\">Globe Telecom<\/a> has already reduced calls to their hotline by 50% with the implementation of Messenger Ads.<\/p>\n<p>So, why should you invest your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/26\/marketing-budget\">marketing budget<\/a> into this ad type? What are the key aspects that you need to know about?<\/p>\n<p>Here are four things you should know about Messenger Ads.<\/p>\n<h2>1. You can reach people faster on their preferred medium<\/h2>\n<p>Customer support is moving towards messaging.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t using a live chat service in some way, shape, or form, you risk losing out on conversions. Because it\u2019s no secret that responding to a potential lead faster will only increase your odds of closing a deal.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2011\/03\/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Business Review<\/a> conducted an impactful study a few years ago to see how a company&#8217;s response time to leads would impact their qualification rate.<\/p>\n<p>They wanted to see if response time played a role in conversion rates. Can you guess the results?<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t respond in the first five minutes of a customer reaching out to you, you decrease your odds of converting them to a lead by 400%.<\/p>\n<p>And according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.drift.com\/year-without-forms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drift study<\/a>, the vast majority of sales teams don\u2019t respond within anywhere near five minutes or less:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-team-response-times.png\" alt=\"sales team response times\" width=\"700\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In their study, only 7% of sales teams responded within 5 minutes. On the other hand, 55% took more than five days to respond to inquiries or never responded at all.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, the standard response time is only shrinking. Meaning you <em>need<\/em> to be responding ASAP if you want to find success when driving sales and qualifying leads.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody wants to wait four days to get an email response from your company.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why messaging apps have started to surpass social networks <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/the-messaging-app-report-2015-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in their usage<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/messaging-apps-usage.jpg\" alt=\"messaging app usage\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edigitalresearch.cowww.edigitalresearch.com\/pdf\/sample-benchmarks\/Customer%20Service%20Benchmark%20March%202014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73% of customers<\/a> prefer talking to companies via live chat rather than email. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/products\/messenger-for-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">56% of people<\/a> would rather message you than call you for customer service.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because you can get your problem solved almost instantly. No more sending hopeless emails to inboxes that seemingly never get checked.<\/p>\n<p>Waiting on the phone, only to be bombarded by an annoying sales rep, isn\u2019t your only option for fast help anymore.<\/p>\n<p>On top of just fast messaging to potential leads, over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/products\/messenger-for-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two billion messages<\/a> are sent between consumers and businesses every month. Facebook also tells us that 53% of consumers are more likely to buy from you if they can message you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-use-facebook-messenger-ads.png\" alt=\"why use facebook messenger ads\" width=\"304\" height=\"198\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads allow you to effectively <strong>reach more people faster<\/strong>, giving your business the chance to convert users at higher rates.<\/p>\n<h2>2. You can personalize ads like LinkedIn\u2019s Sponsored InMail<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/sponsored-inmail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn\u2019s Sponsored InMail<\/a> is equal parts awesome and creepy.<\/p>\n<p>You can essentially send personalized messages to users who you aren\u2019t connected with and land them straight in the user&#8217;s inbox.<\/p>\n<p>How\u2019s that for an invasion of privacy? But they work because online ads are often a numbers game.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads now allow you to do pretty much the same thing, except you can\u2019t target non-brand-aware users \u2013 meaning you can only do this for people who have interacted with your ads previously.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s actually a good thing because it virtually removes the creepiness associated with it. It\u2019s like remarketing on steroids, allowing you to personalize ads from head to toe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/01\/remarketing-facts\">Remarketing also works<\/a>. Clothing company <a href=\"https:\/\/barbellapparel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barbell Apparel<\/a> was able to raise <a href=\"https:\/\/wisemerchant.com\/blog\/surpass-kickstarter-campaign-goal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">49x their product launch goals<\/a> using remarketing tactics.<\/p>\n<p>You can get your message directly to a user within their messaging app, so you\u2019re not restricted only to the news feed, meaning you can (somewhat) naturally reach out via a direct, personalized message.<\/p>\n<p>You can use these for almost any type of remarketing. For example, Jon Loomer uses them to give users who engaged with a previous webinar ad a reminder to convert:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-email-jon-loomer.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads jon loomer\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonloomer.com\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>But the kicker here is being able to scale this effort to huge lists \u2013 you can retarget thousands of people with these semi-personalized messages.<\/p>\n<p>Typical display advertising conversion rates aren\u2019t great. And the Facebook News Feed is already cluttered.<\/p>\n<p>With these ads, you also don\u2019t run the risk of being seen as creepy or overreaching because you\u2019re only targeting people who\u2019ve already shown interest in your brand. And sending a personalized message gives you a better shot at landing conversions than a basic, mass-produced remarketing ad on their feed.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Messenger ads offer better local targeting options<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to use Facebook Messenger Ads is for building localized brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever tried to run ads on Google or Yelp to drive local traffic? Did it work?<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t used those sites or found success, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/13\/facebook-messenger-bots\">Facebook Messenger<\/a> might be your new favorite tool for advertising.<\/p>\n<p>With their new \u201cLocal awareness\u201d feature, you can create newsfeed ads that drive huge levels of engagement.\u00a0You can select a specific local audience depending on where your business is located to determine who will see your ads:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-local-awareness.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads local business awareness\" width=\"1024\" height=\"604\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected a target city or audience, you can come up with specific offers that people can use at your local business:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jaspers-marketing-messenger-ad-examples.jpg\" alt=\"jaspers marketing example\" width=\"650\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Meaning you can drive real foot traffic with a simple, message-style ad!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/24\/local-marketing-tips\">Driving local traffic<\/a> has become increasingly difficult, but with these Facebook Messenger-style local ads, you can reach customers that live nearby with deal-based conversion offers.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Messenger ads are best for starting a conversation<\/h2>\n<p>If getting leads to converse with you is tough, which it probably is, these ads should be your bread and butter (yes, I\u2019m hungry).<\/p>\n<p>Qualifying leads and gauging interest is critical when it comes to producing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">real sales<\/a>. Nobody wants to spend five weeks talking to a lead before finding out that they don\u2019t even care about your product.<\/p>\n<p>And when you can\u2019t simply ask a user to convert instantly (meaning cold traffic), you need to start a casual conversation to assess their needs and interests. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to have to run tons of remarketing ads with your fingers crossed, hoping to land a sale.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads are a perfect balance between ads and real sales conversations.<\/p>\n<p>For example, check out how Jon Loomer uses these ad styles to initiate a real conversion with potential leads:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-send-message-cta.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads messenger cta\" width=\"600\" height=\"692\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonloomer.com\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Instead of instantly asking prospects to sign up for a training course and pay him, he asks them to message him directly and chat about it.<\/p>\n<p>He helps them see if it\u2019s really a good fit, rather than expecting the user to know immediately and shell out their hard-earned cash on it.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, this ad style has the added benefit of extreme personalization: <em>Is this training right for you? Let\u2019s talk it through!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It gives the user an experience that regular remarketing ads simply can\u2019t provide. And once a user responds, you can even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/28\/facebook-messenger-marketing\">customize automated response messages using bots<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ads-chatbots.jpg\" alt=\"facebook messenger ad chat bots\" width=\"600\" height=\"810\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonloomer.com\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-messenger-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Delivering custom offers and CTAs has never been so easy.<\/p>\n<p>You can see another example of how powerful messaging-style interactions can be in Drift\u2019s recent \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.drift.com\/year-without-forms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Year without forms<\/a>\u201d article.<\/p>\n<p>They scrapped the typical marketing and advertising playbook of lead magnets and forms and switched their site over to a mostly messaged-based form of lead gen.<\/p>\n<p>They used welcome messages to engage prospects, similar to how these new Messenger Ads work:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/drift-year-without-forms.png\" alt=\"drift year without forms\" width=\"398\" height=\"140\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Using this strategy of initiating the conversation, they found that 63% of people who clicked on their message ended up speaking with a sales rep.<\/p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">that\u2019s a good conversion rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: there are millions of companies advertising on Facebook. You need to stand out and differentiate (ah, college marketing buzzwords) your business if you want more leads.<\/p>\n<p>Start a conversation with them using Messenger Ads to qualify leads with fewer steps than a traditional sales funnel.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Set Up Facebook Messenger Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve got a grasp on some of the best ways to use Messenger-style ads, it\u2019s time for the fun part: setting them up.<\/p>\n<p>I can tell you\u2019re already jumping for joy.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got a few options for setting up Facebook Messenger Ads.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s relatively easy, and anyone with a <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Business Manager<\/a> account can do it in just a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this platform is still new, growing, and changing, so your options are currently somewhat limited.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, you can only create Messenger-style ads with three different goals: Traffic, conversions, and app installs:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-set-up-fb-messenger-ads-guide.png\" alt=\"how to set up facebook messenger ads\" width=\"977\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Click on your desired marketing objective and create a new ad account for it.<\/p>\n<p>Next, scroll down to the conversion section and select \u201cMessenger\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ads-conversions.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads conversion tracking\" width=\"647\" height=\"233\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This option ensures that users who click on your ad will start a conversation with your business rather than having Facebook direct them to a landing page. That way you can tell them how awesome you guys are. But seriously, don\u2019t do that.<\/p>\n<p>Now you want to edit your placements to fit your goals:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/messenger-ads-edit-placements.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads placements\" width=\"649\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The key here is to make sure that \u201cMessenger\u201d is selected and in use.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also notice that \u201cSponsored Messages\u201d is not eligible yet. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a form of remarketing, as we discussed in the first tip of this article.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected \u201cMessenger,\u201d your ads are just about ready to run. Fill it out with your desired content and head to your call to action.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that \u201cSend Message\u201d is the call to action users will see on your ads:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/messenger-ads-call-to-action.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads cta\" width=\"235\" height=\"81\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now you want to set up your message offers. This is different from your headline or description that you\u2019ll find on the standard ad.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/setup-fb-messenger-ads.png\" alt=\"set up messenger ads on facebook\" width=\"365\" height=\"97\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Essentially, this is what the user will see once they\u2019ve clicked on your ad and are taken to their messenger app. For example, here\u2019s how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JaspersMarket\/\">Jasper\u2019s Market<\/a> customized their message for users that clicked:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/messenger-ads-offer-example.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ads offer example\" width=\"244\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once a potential customer engages with their ad, they\u2019re sent a coupon straight in their messenger dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>You can customize just about everything in the message, from the initial message to the custom responses that a user can choose from:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customize-facebook-message.png\" alt=\"customize facebook message\" width=\"913\" height=\"920\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, here\u2019s how you can structure a potential message to consumers:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/codeless-facebook-messenger-ads.png\" alt=\"codeless facebook messenger ads\" width=\"346\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can offer up a welcome message coupled with a headline and give them multiple options on how to respond.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to use the messaging interaction to take users off-site, you can add buttons instead:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-customer-actions.png\" alt=\"facebook customer actions\" width=\"521\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve customized your messaging, all you have to do is place the order, and your messenger ads will be live.<\/p>\n<h2>A few final words on Messenger Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads allow you to speed up and personalize customer interactions, and reaching people faster is key in today\u2019s cutthroat marketing environment.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are, if you don\u2019t like waiting for an email response or being on hold with customer service, neither do your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of blasting an ad to thousands, you can deliver custom messages to your audience in the form of messaging-based ads.<\/p>\n<p>Reaching a customer in five minutes or less is critical to qualifying a lead, and personalizing those messages can help you drive lower costs and build loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Messenger Ads can specifically help you with personalization and great remarketing.<\/p>\n<p>The new platform also helps with local targeting. You can direct specific, in-store offers to the inbox of local residents with ease.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, it\u2019s great for starting a sales conversation that is otherwise hard-to-obtain. You can instantly start real, natural conversations that can help you nurture a potential lead until they convert.<\/p>\n<p>And once you initiate that connection, you have instant access to their inbox for the rest of time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are Facebook Messenger Ads?
