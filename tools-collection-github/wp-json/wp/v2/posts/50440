Check the SERP<\/h3>\n<p>The easiest way to evaluate the level of freshness that users presumably want for a query is to look at the publication dates of the top results. For example, you can check the first 10 or 20 results and calculate their average age. Ideally, you should also give more weight to the top-ranking results in your calculation.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6fe7a1b3-26b5-4c83-b5e8-6cd0867c3d11\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-freshness-ranking-factor-seo-SERP-first-page.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"895\" alt=\"SERP for query about getting on the first page of google\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>We can see by the SERP that recency is important, but not critical for the query \u201chow to get on the first page of google.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Publish new (evergreen) content regularly<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to always be publishing content on new topics. But as we learned earlier, your rate of new page creation factors into your freshness score. So be sure to be publishing new content regularly, whether on evergreen or time-sensitive topics.<\/p>\n<p>The more frequently you publish content, the more often Google knows to crawl your site.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Update <em>old <\/em>content regularly<\/h3>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub34570\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google research publication<\/a> points out that search engines cannot recrawl every page all the time due to the massive scale of new content being published every day.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Google crawls pages preferentially based on their rate of content update.<\/p>\n<p>By updating old content regularly, you improve your freshness score which can then make it easier for your time-sensitive content to rank.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0781f01-b8dc-4ae8-bb1c-d12f6e455c1a\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-freshness-ranking-factor-seo-ahrefs-pages-published.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"192\" alt=\"pages pubished report in ahrefs\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Report pulled from ahrefs for a social media marketing brand; as expected, they have to update their content very frequently.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Prioritize already-ranking content<\/h3>\n<p>If your content didn\u2019t rank in the first place, the updates are hardly enough to rise to the top. Here are some resources to help you with getting your content to rank:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">10 Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">How to Rank for a Keyword in 10 Steps<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">The Complete Guide to SEO Basics<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Actually update your content&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Changing your article\u2019s published date and the year in the title is a common practice, but this does little to signal freshness to Google. As we covered earlier, changes to the main body of the page are more important to Google than adjusting the date\/time tags. So you\u2019ll need to update the core content of the page.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">While creating fake freshness can potentially increase your CTR, at least momentarily, it will likely result in shorter dwell time on your page if users still find your content somewhat outdated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">And if you end up with weaker <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">engagement metrics<\/a>, that certainly can have a negative impact on your ranking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>6. &#8230;and then actually change the publish date<\/h3>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https:\/\/seoblueprint.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO Blueprint<\/a> training course, Glen Allsopp stresses the importance of aligning the published time Google associates with your URL with the year in your page title.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Articles where the published time doesn\u2019t match the year in the title are, in fact, fairly common.<\/span><\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"eca5fb78-9900-45bc-98e5-9aa6c8e1b17c\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-freshness-ranking-factor-seo-best-seo-tools-serp-date-mismatch.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"486\" alt=\"mismatch of publish date and date in title on SERP\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>7. Submit to Google through Search Console<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">After updating your core content, you may choose to resubmit your sitemap on Google Search Console if you wish to speed up the process of having Google recrawl your updated content. Google will find the changes eventually on its own, so this is usually not worth it for smaller changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cb03125f-8f19-4753-86e2-92686de3c6c4\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-freshness-ranking-factor-seo-sitemap.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"579\" alt=\"google search console sitemap submission\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>When to update, republish, or publish new content<\/h2>\n<p>Whether it makes sense to update content so Googlebot will crawl your page more frequently and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/rank-your-business-higher-on-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rank it higher<\/a> depends on how important freshness is for your query.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/google-ranking-factors\/#freshness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> suggests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When freshness is crucial:<\/strong> Update the page frequently or publish new articles on the topic regularly to keep up with demand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When freshness is important but not critical:<\/strong> Update the page regularly, and if ranking starts to drop, consider revising and republishing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When freshness isn\u2019t important: <\/strong>Focus on creating the best possible guide on the topic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So let\u2019s take a look at your options when freshness is crucial or important.<\/p>\n<h3>When to update content<\/h3>\n<p>While Google pays more attention to major updates, minor updates to a page are still important, because as we mentioned, a page\u2019s freshness deprecates over time, no matter how evergreen.

This becomes relevant when an article requires a complete overhaul to meet visitors\u2019 need for recent, up-to-date content. It should earn you a higher freshness score than a simple update.<\/p>\n<p>This method is best for evergreen topics that resonate with your audience long-term; as well as pages for which you want to preserve backlinks and other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">beneficial SEO traits<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"20eb1ed9-dfe5-495f-8fc4-192191cb3091\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-freshness-ranking-factor-seo-always-up-to-date-guide.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" alt=\"content freshness: example of revising and republishing \" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Great example of revising and republishing by <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/social-media-image-sizes-guide\/\"><em>Sprout Social<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whenever republishing revised articles, it\u2019s a good idea to share them on social media, just as you would any other new article to boost engagement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip: <\/strong>Another option is to combine several topically related, outdated articles into one updated ultimate guide and redirect all traffic from the old pages to the new one.
