We\u2019re witnessing a shift in the ways your prospects search for products online. You may feel tempted to do away with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping campaigns<\/a> and give all your money to Jeff Bezos.<\/p>\n<p>[Awesome, juvenile joke regarding Mr. Bezos\u2019 personal life redacted in the name of professionalism or whatever.]<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t do that. Nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/2237\/internet-usage-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">300 million Americans<\/a> use the internet. That means roughly 100 million of them turn to Google when they want to search for products like yours. Neglecting to run Shopping ads is akin to owning a brick-and-mortar store that\u2019s open from 11 pm until 7 am.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plus, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/go.jumpshot.com\/Q2-18-Data-Report.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that Jumpshot study<\/a> I referenced earlier, <strong>Shopping listings turn prospects into buyers faster than do Amazon listings<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas 35% of Google product searches <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion\">turn into transactions<\/a> within five days, only 20% of Amazon product searches do the same. The average amount of time between a Google product search and a purchase is 20 days. It\u2019s 26 days on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>So, not only do Shopping ads work\u2014they work fast. However, effectiveness isn\u2019t a given. If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/06\/increase-ppc-profits\">drive returns<\/a>, you have to optimize your Google Shopping feed.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Even a perfect Google Shopping feed can&#8217;t make up for poor campaign structure. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our free guide<\/a> to learn what it takes to build profitable campaigns!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is a Google Shopping feed?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Short answer: Your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-google-shopping-listings\">Google Shopping feed<\/a> is a\u00a0spreadsheet that describes and organizes your product catalog in a way that Google can easily crawl and understand.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&#8217;t worry\u2014we&#8217;ll explain.<\/p>\n<p>Shopping campaigns work differently than standard\u00a0Search campaigns. Whereas Search advertisers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/bid\">bid on keywords<\/a>\u2014and, thus, determine which search queries trigger their text ads\u2014Shopping advertisers don\u2019t have direct control over which search queries trigger their Shopping ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"016809e9-dc13-404c-b0ff-475cf810bde1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-serp-final.jpg\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-product-results\" width=\"800\" height=\"412\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead, Google crawls Shopping advertisers\u2019 websites and feeds to determine which ads are relevant for a given search query. The relevance of your ads, then, depends on the robustness of your Google Shopping feed. This should sound familiar: <strong>Google Shopping f<\/strong><strong>eed optimization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">works similarly to SEO<\/a><\/strong>. In both cases, you\u2019re providing relevant information with the intent of appearing when people Google search particular queries.<\/p>\n<p>Shopping advertisers who sell only a handful of products should feel free to create their feeds manually in Google Sheets. Those who sell hundreds or thousands of products need to use an app or service\u00a0that can crawl their websites and auto-generate their feeds in a Google-friendly manner.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to optimize your Google Shopping feed<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For this section, we\u2019ll walk through the main elements of your Google Shopping feed and provide basic optimization tips. To make sure these tips are as reliable as possible, I spoke with Kelly McGee and Sam Drane\u2014two experts on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> team who consistently drive returns for their ecommerce clients.<\/p>\n<p>But first, let\u2019s address the theme you\u2019re about to observe: <strong>When creating your Google Shopping feed, there\u2019s no such thing as too much information<\/strong>. Describing your products in greater detail will only increase the relevance of your ads. Conversely, the less information you provide, the less precisely Google can match your ads with search queries.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Product title<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your product title is the blue hyperlinked text at the top of your Shopping ad.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e703d50-9234-472b-a4b2-2a322b3b915b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-product-title-final.png\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-product-title\" width=\"800\" height=\"155\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kelly and Sam were clear about their first piece of advice: Your product title is your <strong>top priority<\/strong> when optimizing your Google Shopping feed.. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t keyword stuff,\u201d says Sam. \u201cPick a target keyword and get it as close to the front of your product title as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Your product title is analogous to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">website page title<\/a>. When Google is looking for relevant results, it looks to the title first.<\/p>\n<p>Although you shouldn\u2019t keyword stuff, you <em>should<\/em> be detailed. Online shoppers tend to search long-tail queries when they\u2019re getting ready to buy. By including the brand, color, size, style, model, gender, measurements, and any other relevant attributes, you give yourself a better shot of capturing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Product image<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your product image is the\u2014uh\u2014image of your product.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c0afdff0-9439-4c01-a31f-abaab429fb59\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-product-image.jpg\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-image\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cProduct images are extremely important to your Google Shopping feed,\u201d Kelly explains. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/05\/product-landing-pages\">They have to look professional.<\/a> Nobody clicks on an ad with an awful image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As you may intuit, product images are less about communicating relevance to Google and more about attracting consumers\u2019 eyes. Think of it like making a first impression. Do you want prospects to associate your brand with sloppiness or with professionalism?<\/p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324350?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a few rules<\/a>, too: no watermarks, no additional text, and no logos.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Product category<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your product category doesn\u2019t show up on the prospect-facing side\u2014it\u2019s strictly a backend attribute that Google takes into consideration when populating the Shopping search results.<\/p>\n<p>This is a required part of your Google Shopping feed. In order to make a product eligible for advertisement, you must select a category from Google\u2019s Product Taxonomy, or GPT. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/basepages\/producttype\/taxonomy.en-US.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Available for download<\/a>, the GPT is complete with over 6,000 categories and subcategories.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to relevance, product category is extremely important,\u201d says Sam. \u201cThe more targeted you are with your subcategories, the more relevant your product will be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, narrow it down. If you sell baby socks, don\u2019t simply categorize them like this:<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Apparel &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing<\/p>\n<p>Instead, categorize them like this:<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Apparel &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Baby &amp; Toddler Clothing &gt; Baby &amp; Toddler Socks &amp; Tights<\/p>\n<p>Remember: There\u2019s no such thing as too much product information.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Product type<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Plain and simple, your product type is an opportunity to give Google another backend attribute that helps determine relevance. Unlike product category, it\u2019s optional.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c07b3aa-351b-4a92-95dc-5a963fe284ca\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-optimization-sample-final.png\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-sample\" width=\"800\" height=\"183\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But, according to Kelly, it\u2019s not <em>really<\/em> optional. \u201cIn some cases, the GPT will provide the perfect categorization of your product,\u201d she says. \u201cMore often, you\u2019ll find yourself wishing you could be just a <em>bit more<\/em> precise.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where product type comes in. It\u2019s your chance to paint an even better picture of your product. If painting a better picture means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">getting your ad served to more relevant audiences<\/a>, product type is a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p>This is an especially crucial attribute for those of you who sell <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche products<\/a>. Admittedly, I haven\u2019t memorized the GPT. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fairly certain it doesn\u2019t include a subcategory called Bruce Lee Custom Merchandise. Therefore, if you sell handcrafted grandfather clocks in the shape of Bruce Lee (drop me a line), you\u2019re going to need to use product type.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Product description<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re back to the prospect-facing side of things. Your product description is the text that appears below your product title and to the right of your product image.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7cbe5785-4041-4dfc-9640-242018ef6dfb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-description.jpg\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-product-description\" width=\"800\" height=\"573\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s a common misconception that you can use the product description to get, in Kelly\u2019s words, \u201cfluffy.\u201d What she means is that a lot of well-meaning Shopping advertisers write lengthy product descriptions that, frankly, provide frivolous information.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle crawls your product descriptions for relevant keywords,\u201d Kelly explains. \u201cIt\u2019s your chance to target secondary keywords that didn\u2019t make the cut for the product title.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As is the case with your product title, <strong>don\u2019t keyword stuff<\/strong>. Be detailed and thorough, but not spammy. If you can, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">get those second-tier keywords<\/a> as close to the beginning of the description as possible.<\/p>\n<p>And believe it or not, you can do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/20\/google-shopping-ab-testing\">A\/B testing with your Shopping campaigns<\/a> to try out different variations.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Custom labels<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is less of a Google Shopping feed optimization tip and more of an advanced bidding tactic. But it\u2019s relevant.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re building out your Shopping campaigns, you divide your product catalog across buckets. You can segment as you like\u2014according to brand, style, age groups, etc. Once you\u2019ve created your product buckets, you assign bids to them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"030414d6-a27b-4b22-aa2d-6aa742f1a557\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-buckets.png\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-optimization-product-groups\" width=\"750\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/savvyrevenue.com\/blog\/adwords-from-scratch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savvy Revenue<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s say you sell athleisure apparel and you divide your products across buckets according to brand. You\u2019ve got a lululemon bucket, an Athleta bucket, and an Outdoor Voices bucket.<\/p>\n<p>You <em>could<\/em> set bids at the bucket level. But there\u2019s a problem: Your best-selling product is a pair of lululemon pants. It sells much, much better than do other lululemon products in your catalog. As such, you want to bid up on that particular pair of pants.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what custom labels are for. They allow you to differentiate amongst products that are categorized within the same bucket and to set bids accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI always jump on the opportunity to set custom labels for my clients,\u201d says Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple, effective way to segment your catalog and prioritize your heavy hitters.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Miscellaneous product information<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your <strong>product price<\/strong> is a required part of your Google Shopping feed, of course. Make sure to see what others are charging for the same products and price yours competitively.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a reseller, you must include in your feed the <strong>brand<\/strong> of each product in your catalog.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell apparel, you have to list attributes such as <strong>gender<\/strong> (male, female, unisex), <strong>color<\/strong>, <strong>size<\/strong> (small, medium, large, etc.), <strong>size type<\/strong> (regular, petite, maternity, etc.), <strong>age group<\/strong>, and <strong>size system<\/strong> (U.S., U.K., E.U., etc.).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d7b7d3ab-4e1d-42df-8a3e-42afeb84af43\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-feed-miscellaneous-data.jpg\" alt=\"google-shopping-feed-womens-coat\" width=\"800\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every product you sell must have a <strong>Global Trade Item Number<\/strong>.

Additionally, when populating the Shopping search results, Google groups together sellers that are offering products with the same GTIN.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, across your Google Shopping feed, you must indicate each product\u2019s <strong>condition<\/strong> (new or used) and <strong>availability<\/strong> (in stock, out of stock, or available for preorder).<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">An optimized Google Shopping feed: crucial to your success<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can spend tons of time perfecting your products.
