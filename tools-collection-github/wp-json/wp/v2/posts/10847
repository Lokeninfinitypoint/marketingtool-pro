These four expert-recommended strategies will help you to obtain and implement that knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Recreate your personas<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re no longer serving the customer you were serving 6 months ago. That means it\u2019s time to update <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">your personas<\/a> so your messaging, outreach, sales, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">branding<\/a> are actually attracting customers to you. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.10xdigitalinc.com\/how-to-create-a-business-vision-board\/\">Holly Rollins<\/a>, President of 10x digital echoes this sentiment in her recent blog post. She says:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cEven if you\u2019ve done this exercise before, it\u2019s still a great time to revisit\u2014especially with the drastic shifts that have occurred during this season. A persona should include your target audience\u2019s general demographic\/psychographic details, behaviors, industry pain points, and concerns.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"225106bb-9d2c-4168-983b-2a3bf65d3928\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get20to20know20your20post20covid20customer20personas.png\" alt=\"get to know your post covid customer personas\" width=\"672\" height=\"372\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">From our post on <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\"><em>buyer personas<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Rollins suggests that your personas should also include details that help you dig deeper into their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/17\/science-of-emotion-in-marketing-courtney-seiter\">emotions<\/a>, purchasing behaviors, and more, including: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motivations<\/li>\n<li>Purchasing habits<\/li>\n<li>Goals and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">objectives<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Frustrations<\/li>\n<li>Personality type<\/li>\n<li>Roles and responsibilities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One way to get your new persona information is to conduct one-on-one customer and client interviews. Get to know what they want and need right now and build those new customer profiles around their responses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Don\u2019t ignore social media<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/25\/covid-19-facebook-advertising\">In a post-pandemic world, social media can no longer be avoided<\/a>\u2014both for getting to know your customers\u00a0and for connecting with them. A recent study from <a href=\"https:\/\/cmosurvey.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The_CMO_Survey-Highlights-and_Insights_Report-June-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CMO<\/a> found that 84% of companies were using social media for brand building and more than 54% have used it for customer retention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0But what does that mean for getting to know your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/17\/post-pandemic-digital-marketing-statistics\">post-COVID custome<\/a>r? Just as you conducted the one-on-one client check-ins for personas, it\u2019s important to use social media as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\">tool to connect with<\/a> and get to know your post-COVID customer passively and actively. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passively take note of consistent questions and comments. What patterns are emerging about the verbiage your customers are using and the topics they\u2019re discussing?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively seek out conversations with your customers via comments and DMs, polls, surveys, and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/06\/instagram-story-highlights\">engagement features on social media<\/a>. With so many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">interactive tools<\/a> now available through social media, you can intentionally get to know your customer better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e1d34769-4069-46aa-bf6c-b6ab675bb445\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20to20know20your20post20covid20customer20CMO20survey20social20media.png\" alt=\"how to get to know your post covid customer CMO survey social media\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Remember, however, that above all, consumers are looking for authenticity, especially on social media.

Build customer engagement into your culture<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In our post-COVID world, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">customer engagement<\/a> and development are key. For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.groovehq.com\/blog\/customer-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Turnbull<\/a>, founder of Groove, it\u2019s all about getting your customers on the phone on a regular basis to discuss their pains, their needs, and their challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While Turnbull likes to have these conversations off-the-cuff, it might help you to prepare a few questions, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How has your business or life changed since COVID-19?<\/li>\n<li>What would make your life easier?<\/li>\n<li>How can our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">product or service<\/a> be better suited to your current needs?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Remember: this type of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">customer communication<\/a> goes beyond one-on-one calls. Build this mentality and curiosity into your company culture so anyone on the phone with a potential or current customer is culling these insights. When everyone is asking the same questions, patterns will emerge, allowing you to get to know this new customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Track customer sentiment<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Tracking what your customer is saying, feeling, and thinking is a critical right now.
