AI Overviews shook up Google SERPs<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve run informational searches on Google recently, you\u2019ve likely seen something like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/ai-overview-example.webp\" alt=\"example of ai overviews on google\" width=\"870\" height=\"469\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87687\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/ai-overview-example.webp 870w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/ai-overview-example-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These are AI Overviews, AI-generated responses to queries created by Google. Three things are currently true about AI Overviews:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In some niches for some sites, they\u2019ve already had a massive impact.<\/li>\n<li>In some niches and for some sites, they\u2019ve had precisely zero impact.<\/li>\n<li>Their impact is expanding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the history of AI Overviews:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google tested AI Overviews (then called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/19\/google-search-generative-experience\">Search Generative Experience or SGE<\/a>) from 2023 to 2024.<\/li>\n<li>On May 14, 2024, Google officially rolled out these overviews, calling them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\">AI Overviews<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Many of these results were pretty bad, even <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-overview-fails-442575\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dangerous<\/a>, and Google got a lot of blowback in the press for the quality of AI overviews.<\/li>\n<li>Third parties have <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">estimated<\/a> that the number of search queries impacted by AI overviews was between 7-15% in the summer of 2024.<\/li>\n<li>Those numbers continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-overviews-volatility-continues-rise-fall-repeat-445177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fluctuate<\/a>, and Google <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/ai-overviews-search-october-2024\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expanded the reach of AI Overviews to over 100 countries at the end of October 2024<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Percentages like 7-15% don\u2019t sound like a lot, but for a certain set of queries that might mean more like 80% of searches. Or your site might get 60-70% of its traffic from 25-50 pages, and those pages might be disproportionally impacted.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a cybersecurity software company, you may be seeing results like this one (only with ads overlaid over the AI Overview) in all of the search results where you rank in organic results:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp\" alt=\"ai overview example from cybersecurity query\" width=\"856\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87688\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp 856w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you\u2019re a local business trying to rank for plumbing in Sioux Falls, you likely don\u2019t have an AI Overview within miles of your SERPs:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/plumbing-query-example.webp\" alt=\"plumbing query example\" width=\"738\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87689\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/plumbing-query-example.webp 738w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/plumbing-query-example-480x390.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The results here are still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/11\/google-local-service-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Services Ads<\/a>, Google Maps, and standard organic search.

AI-generated content was created en masse<\/h3>\n<p>The ability to push a button and\u2014for very low costs\u2014generate content of reasonable quality is another thing that\u2019s had a major impact on SEO in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Originality AI <a href=\"https:\/\/originality.ai\/ai-content-in-google-search-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">estimates<\/a> that the percentage of AI content ranking in the top 20 Google results has more than doubled in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Entire industries have been built around the growth of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\">generative AI content<\/a>, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/ai-chatgpt-content-detectors-395957\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI content detectors<\/a><\/li>\n<li>AI writing tools<\/li>\n<li>AI content editing services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And of course, many more are likely to pop up over time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-responded-to-ai-generated-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Google responded to AI-generated content<\/h3>\n<p>During the pandemic, people flocked to online sources to do comparison shopping. Many affiliates had quietly been ranking for all kinds of \u201cbest X\u201d and \u201cbest X for Y\u201d searches. With all of the new search volume around these terms, additional attention (in the form of media and users noticing) was paid to this fact.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequent updates meant that these smaller affiliates were replaced with large, authoritative sites (more on this shortly).<\/p>\n<p>This is a common trend in Google search results over the years. It\u2019s happened with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/jason-calacanis-revenge-google-matt-cutts-18794.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">larger publishers cranking out thin content<\/a>, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2014\/03\/19\/google-penalizes-myblogguest-a-guest-blog-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guest blog marketplaces<\/a>, with <a href=\"https:\/\/retrododo.com\/google-is-killing-retro-dodo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">niche sites<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/seo-heist-aftermath-how-burn-your-organic-traffic-nick-malekos-yjqgf\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it\u2019s already happened with AI<\/a>. The basic cycle goes something like this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>{Thing} starts to work for ranking in Google.<\/li>\n<li>Attention starts to swirl around the fact that {thing} is working, there is an article in the tech press somewhere.<\/li>\n<li>Google takes some kind of action (sometimes manual, sometimes algorithmic).<\/li>\n<li>{Thing} may still work to some extent or with some specific adjustments, but it doesn\u2019t work as easily or for the same people (particularly those who had been highlighted in the press).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Advice from 17 years ago still stands: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seobook.com\/understanding-psychology-google-user-through-actions-engineer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don\u2019t make Google look stupid<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 <strong>Want to use AI the right way?<\/strong> Free download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-generated-content-creation\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Search results shifted to focus on forum and tools content<\/h3>\n<p>As Google responded to AI content, one of the biggest shifts in 2024 (a continuation of Google updates over the last couple of years) has been how aggressively \u201cUGC\u201d or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content<\/a> from forums and Q&amp;A sites has been.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">organic traffic<\/a> to Reddit:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp\" alt=\"organic traffic to reddit\" width=\"829\" height=\"355\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87690\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/organic-traffic-to-reddit-480x206.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s organic traffic to a niche forum focused on stargazing (many niches will have a forum or two with the same graph):<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp\" alt=\"traffic to niche forum on stargazing\" width=\"827\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87691\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp 827w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/niche-forum-stargazing-example-480x204.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And here\u2019s the traffic graph for Omnicalculator, a large site with calculators around topics like calculating a dog\u2019s weight, calculating steps to calories, etc.:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/omnicalculator-traffic.webp\" alt=\"traffic to omnicalculator\" width=\"829\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87692\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/omnicalculator-traffic.webp 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/omnicalculator-traffic-480x203.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking at where Omnicalculator has gained traffic in the last year is particularly instructive here. Some of the terms are calculator terms where they displaced other calculators or traditional articles, but here are some terms in the top 10 traffic gainers for them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>calorie deficit<\/li>\n<li>slope<\/li>\n<li>diameter of a circle<\/li>\n<li>how to find the p value<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"search-results-shifted-to-favor-forum-tools-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Affiliates and niche sites were hit hard by updates<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Helpful Content Update impacted a lot of \u201cniche sites\u201d or small independent publishing sites focused on a specific area (frequently focused around and dependent upon Google for traffic, which was then monetized via ads or affiliate marketing).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/august-2024-google-core-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Some sites have seen recoveries<\/a>, some have seen partial recoveries, and many have abandoned any effort to recover or rank in Google at all.<\/p>\n<p>Helpful content updates have been the subject of a ton of speculation, misinformation, and agitation for those impacted. Speculation about the focus of these updates includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/helpful-content-update-not-what-you-think\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">focus on brand strength<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The wrong combination of not having a strong domain and <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/GrindstoneSEO\/status\/1851858039432974381\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">having the wrong anchor text mix<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cOver-optimization\u201d or an overly aggressive (particularly for smaller sites with fewer\/lower quality link domains pointed to their site) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/outdated-seo-tactics\">SEO tactics<\/a> (title tags, headers, content, and links all using targeted keywords aggressively).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"parasite-seo-gained-traction\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Parasite SEO gained traction<\/h3>\n<p>Every Google action leads to an equal and sometimes opposite reaction from SEOs.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting picture is starting to form here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI content is getting better and is widely and cheaply available.<\/li>\n<li>Google has aggressively favored UGC or forum content and content hosted on big brand sites like Forbes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Enter: Parasite SEO and \u201cSite Reputation Abuse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Charles_SEO\/status\/1848335859608957257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">parasite SEO didn\u2019t start in 2024<\/a>, it has become a more talked about and more heavily utilized tactic.<\/p>\n<p>This manifests in a few ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reddit spam:<\/strong> Many people have found ways to game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">Reddit<\/a> so that their recommendations float to the top of Reddit posts and threads that are ranking in high-traffic search results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Contributed articles:<\/strong> Marketers would pay to have an article placed on an authoritative site with their own affiliate links in the article. Often these marketers will also use low-quality (and cheap) link sources to get the articles to rank (this can work on authoritative sites, even if it frequently may not on smaller sites, and of course there\u2019s little risk for the poster because the site getting risky and spammy links pointed to it is not their site).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brands doing affiliate marketing:<\/strong> Large brands like <a href=\"https:\/\/larslofgren.com\/forbes-marketplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNET<\/a> cranked out AI-generated articles and\/or product roundup posts and generated affiliate income from that content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And, of course, as this practice got more and more press and attention, Google responded with a \u201csite reputation abuse\u201d policy and <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2024\/11\/site-reputation-abuse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">update<\/a> this year.<\/p>\n<p>Outlook India, which had become a popular parasite SEO host, has seen surges and drops in the way of all of this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp\" alt=\"traffic to outlook india parasite seo site\" width=\"830\" height=\"353\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp 830w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/outlook-india-parasite-seo-480x204.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/media\/cnn-forbes-lose-millions-google-seo-policy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes and CNN<\/a> saw hits as well:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp\" alt=\"traffic loss for forbes and cnn\" width=\"829\" height=\"358\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87694\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/forbes-cnn-traffic-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>More and more stories <a href=\"https:\/\/recleudo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">along these lines<\/a> continue to surface, and as they get pushed into the press and Google responds, what works and doesn\u2019t will likely continue to change.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-recognized-as-monopoly\"><\/div>\n<h3>7.
