Instead, the conversions often result from a user seeing an ad, taking some time to think about the product or service, and then finding the conversion page via an Internet search or webpage link. A conversion then follows.<\/p>\n<p>In September, <a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2009\/09\/announcing-view-through-conversion.html\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2009\/09\/announcing-view-through-conversion.html\">Google started tracking view-through conversion statistics<\/a> for display ads on its content network. And earlier this year Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/ads.ak.facebook.com\/ads\/FacebookAds\/ConversionTrackingGuide.pdf\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/ads.ak.facebook.com\/ads\/FacebookAds\/ConversionTrackingGuide.pdf\">began beta testing a conversion tracking service<\/a> that includes view-through conversion, or \u201cpost-impression\u201d conversion figures.<\/p>\n<p>You may or may not decide to rely upon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/view-through-conversion\">view-through conversion<\/a> figures. But regardless of your decision, know the pros and cons of this type of conversion tracking.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the pros of tracking view-through conversions?<\/h2>\n<h3>1. <strong>You have another tool for evaluating your display advertisement campaigns<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you just focus on the percentage of users who click on your ad and then perform the desired action, you may be unnecessarily disappointed. People tend to click less on display ads on content sites than text ads in the SERPs and Google\u2019s search network. That\u2019s because they are generally on a content site to read about a particular topic, not to search for and buy a particular product. But that doesn\u2019t mean the ad won\u2019t prompt them to undertake the desired action at a later date. By not discounting this type of conversion, you have a fuller picture of your ad campaigns\u2019 performance.<\/p>\n<h3>2. <strong>View-through conversion data can help you optimize your ads<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By tracking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/14\/view-through-conversions\">view-through conversion data<\/a> for all of the sites and pages you\u2019re advertising on, you can see which ad placements are resulting in the most view-through conversions and highest view-through conversion rates. With this information, you can improve your underperforming ads by incorporating design and content techniques that worked for the successful ads. Or you can shift underperforming ads to sites and pages that worked for the successful ads. Make sure, however, that the changes you implement don\u2019t compromise your click conversion rates.<\/p>\n<h3>3. <strong>A view-through conversion focus can save you money<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By using view-through conversion data to improve your ads, your potential for conversions and revenue increases. You can also save money by focusing on view-through conversion data. The more people who see your pay-per-click ad, don\u2019t click on it, and later purchase your product or service, the less money you must pay out for clicks. You are also building your brand for a smaller charge. Still, this doesn\u2019t mean you want to neglect optimizing your ads for click conversions. If your click conversion rate is pretty high, then those conversions are likely generating enough revenue to outweigh the click charges.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the cons of tracking view-through conversion rate?<\/h2>\n<h3>1. <strong>You don\u2019t really know if the ad generated the conversion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With click conversions, the user frequently clicks the ad immediately after viewing the ad. But with view-through conversions the user tends to arrive at the conversion page a significant amount of time (often days or weeks) after viewing the ad. This increases the chances that the ad itself did not prompt the conversion, but an alternative factor like an Internet search or website link. It\u2019s also possible that \u201cview-through\u201d customers actually didn\u2019t even see the ad. It may have been on the site they were perusing, but for whatever reason they missed it. A Facebook user, for example, may have been too busy looking at his friends\u2019 status updates. Thus, view-through conversion data is generally less sound than click conversion data.<\/p>\n<h3>2. <strong>View-through conversions are not counted after a certain period of time<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Currently, Google only counts view-through conversions that take place within 30 days of the ad impression. In other words, if a user sees the ad on Oct. 1, but signs up for the associated newsletter on Nov. 1 via an Internet search, that conversion won\u2019t be considered a view-through conversion (It also won\u2019t be considered a click conversion). It appears that Facebook\u2019s beta conversion tracking service only counts view-though conversions <a href=\"http:\/\/ads.ak.facebook.com\/ads\/FacebookAds\/ConversionTrackingGuide.pdf\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/ads.ak.facebook.com\/ads\/FacebookAds\/ConversionTrackingGuide.pdf\">that take place within 28 days<\/a> of the ad impression. Whiles these limits may hinder Google and Facebook\u2019s ability to provide a detailed portrait of its conversions, they\u2019re similar to time constraints in place for click conversion reporting.<\/p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Other factors can also limit accuracy of view-through conversion reporting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Companies partaking in view-through conversion tracking are able to identify \u201cpost-impression\u201d customers by locating a particular cookie on their browser. The cookie was added to the browser when the user saw the advertisement. The problem with this tracking method is that some people may delete their cookies before the completion of the tracking period (Google\u2019s is 30 days). Also, companies won\u2019t know you\u2019re a view-through customer if you purchase the product or service from a computer different from the one you viewed the ad with. While both of these factors can also apply to click conversion tracking, they are still worth noting.<\/p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/31796655@N07\/2974942783\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/31796655@N07\/2974942783\/\">http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/31796655@N07\/2974942783\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn the pros and cons of view-through conversion tracking, a type of tracking that measures conversions that don\u2019t result from clicks on a PPC ad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":215,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[18],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-25515","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-conversion-rates"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Pros and Cons of View-Through Conversion Tracking<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"What is a view-through conversion?
