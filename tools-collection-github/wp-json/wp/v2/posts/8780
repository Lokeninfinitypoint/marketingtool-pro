Are you ready to tap into this billion-dollar industry?<\/p>\n<div id=\"benefits-of-affiliate-marketing-for-a-business\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">What are the benefits of affiliate marketing to small businesses?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Small businesses often have limited resources and budgets. Sometimes they do not even have a dedicated marketing team to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/02\/promote-your-business\">promote their business<\/a>.\u00a0Affiliate marketing offers a cost-effective and efficient way to drive more traffic to your business and increase profits. However,\u00a0while having a terrific <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/07\/14\/affiliate-marketing-strategies\">affiliate marketing<\/a> network is a huge advantage for small businesses, you still need to be selective in who you choose.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than accepting everyone into your program, it is best to have a vetting process in place. In the same way that an ecommerce search marketing strategy impacts your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">brand&#8217;s visibility<\/a>, your affiliates also impact your brand image and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/why-good-online-reputation-is-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reputation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Much like the search engine strategies used in ecommerce, affiliate marketing will help increase your product exposure and<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\"> increase sales<\/a>. Here&#8217;s a rundown of its benefits:<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">1. Boost\u00a0brand awareness<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Every business&#8217;s online goal is to be easily recognized by as many potential buyers as possible. As affiliates <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive more traffic to your website<\/a>, they increase awareness of your brand and its reach.\u00a0Because affiliates earn a share of your revenue, they have a vested interest in your success, are loyal brand advocates, and help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">build trust<\/a> with potential customers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">2. Enhance\u00a0social proof<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Consumers today are more informed and have higher expectations than ever before. They rely heavily on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a> of a brand&#8217;s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">reputation<\/a>.\u00a0According to research, almost <a href=\"https:\/\/spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu\/_pdf\/Spiegel_Online%20Review_eBook_Jun2017_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">95% of consumers<\/a> read <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">online reviews<\/a> before deciding to make a purchase.\u00a0When a company builds rapport with an engaged audience that trusts them, their affiliate product or service reviews provide credible social proof to prospective buyers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">3. Reach a broader targeted audience<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Small businesses can tap into the audience of their affiliates and, as a result, expand their brand&#8217;s reach. These new audiences might not have been easy to target and identify using other marketing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/20\/creative-advertising-ideas\">advertising methods<\/a>.\u00a0By selecting affiliates who resonate with your brand, you ensure that the traffic you receive through an affiliate&#8217;s link will be targeted to those who find your products or services useful.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">4. Improve conversion rates<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The ability to track how your business performs enables you to make operational improvements in the future.\u00a0By <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/16\/marketing-analysis-tools\">collecting data<\/a> from affiliate marketing tracking, companies can gain essential insights into where their customers come from and why they are buying.<\/p>\n<p>Studying and analyzing the rich collection of data helps companies improve conversions by making changes to their website, offering<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/22\/visual-marketing-tools\"> more engaging visual creatives<\/a>, and identifying which affiliates bring in the most revenue.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42065\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/affiliate-marketing-benefits.png\" alt=\"affiliate marketing benefits\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/affiliate-marketing-benefits.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/affiliate-marketing-benefits-480x319.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">5.

Businesses are not paying for potential buyers through impressions or clicks, only for closed sales.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the primary reasons small businesses choose to utilize affiliates to promote and sell their products or services.\u00a0By channeling your promotion efforts through an affiliate program, you are gaining influence and direct access to a receptive, highly targeted audience more likely to buy from your company.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-start-affiliate-marketing-small-business\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">How to set up an affiliate program for your small business<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Before getting started, make sure you understand the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking#affiliateornetwork\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines<\/a> about disclosing affiliate relationships. And\u00a0do not assume that if you create an affiliate program for your small business, affiliates will automatically join.<\/p>\n<p>First off, potential affiliates need to know your program exists. Equally as important is providing an incentive for someone to want to become an affiliate and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promote your products or services<\/a>.\u00a0For example, Amazon, the most popular affiliate program, offers more advantages and benefits than its competitors.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/affiliate-marketing-amazon-1.png\" alt=\"small business guide to affiliate marketing\u2014amazon associates program\" width=\"800\" height=\"292\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The massive range of products one can buy from Amazon is unbeatable. It is easy to become an affiliate, and there is no need to be a developer or web designer to use the tools they provide.\u00a0No one can expect to compete with Amazon&#8217;s affiliate program, but it is an excellent example to follow when setting up yours.<\/p>\n<p>Below are the necessary steps to setting up an effective and successful affiliate marketing program for your small business.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1.
