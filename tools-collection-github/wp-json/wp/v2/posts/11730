Think in terms of series, not individual videos<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A lot of YouTube creators organize their videos into playlists. Why is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The explanation is simple: If you click on a video that\u2019s embedded in a playlist, the next video in that playlist will automatically start as soon as the current video ends. As a result, a viewer can watch several related videos without lifting a finger. This, of course, makes YouTube happy, as it translates into greater ad revenue. But it should also make <em>you <\/em>happy, as it translates into greater engagement and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/30\/facebook-video-views\">more video views<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20series.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube series\" width=\"400\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It goes without saying that compiling a bunch of unrelated videos into a giant playlist makes for a bad user experience. Instead, I recommend brainstorming your YouTube content not in terms of individual videos, but rather in terms of <strong>series<\/strong>. That way, as time goes on and you create more content, it\u2019s easy to organize your videos into logical playlists. Your viewers will benefit from a seamless, enjoyable experience, and <em>you<\/em> will benefit from an uptick in views. Win-win!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s an example. If I were marketing, say, a baseball academy, I would focus on creating a handful of video series: one about pitching, one about batting, one about playing in the outfield, and so on. Brainstorming with this framework from the outset is a great way to set yourself up for YouTube success.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"learn-youtube-seo\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">3. Get familiar with YouTube SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Like I said: YouTube is a search engine. And just like any other search engine, YouTube uses a handful of ranking signals to organize its search results. Understanding <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/10\/youtube-seo-tips\">YouTube SEO<\/a>, the major ranking signals\u2014and how to appeal to them\u2014is a crucial part of getting more views on YouTube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First things first: You need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/14\/youtube-keyword-research\">keywords<\/a>. Without target keywords, there\u2019s nothing to optimize for. Once you\u2019ve made a list of the topics you want to address (thinking in terms of series!), go ahead and type them\u2014one by one\u2014into the YouTube search bar. As you\u2019ve probably seen before, YouTube will generate a list of suggested search queries. Each of these suggestions is something that\u2019s been searched over and over again by real YouTube users. Each of them, in other words, is a great candidate for a target keyword!<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20seo.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube seo\" width=\"400\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s important to note that some keywords are more competitive\u2014i.e., harder to rank for\u2014than others. With WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>, you can get a sense of how competitive each of your keywords is. Although the tool pulls data from Google and Bing\u2014not YouTube\u2014it\u2019s nonetheless an effective way to gauge the level of difficulty you\u2019re dealing with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve got your keywords in order, it\u2019s time to optimize. Let\u2019s briefly walk through the major YouTube ranking signals you need to be cognizant of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">SEO for YouTube video titles<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When deciding where to place your video in the search results for a particular query, YouTube looks at a number of attributes\u2014the most important one being your <strong>video title<\/strong>. Plain and simple, if you want your video to rank for a given keyword, that keyword needs to appear in the title\u2014ideally at the <em>beginning <\/em>of the title, as there\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/how-to-rank-youtube-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anecdotal evidence<\/a> to suggest that starting your title with your target keyword can drive a small bump in rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20title20seo_0.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube title seo\" width=\"800\" height=\"238\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Note that there should be more to your title than <em>just <\/em>the target keyword. Ranking is important, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee clicks. We\u2019ll talk more about enticing users with your video titles later on in this guide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">SEO for YouTube video descriptions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The second attribute you need to optimize is your <strong>video description<\/strong>. Though not as essential as your title, your description is taken into consideration when the search results are being organized. Make sure to include your target keyword at least once!<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20description.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube description\" width=\"800\" height=\"211\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There\u2019s a difference between keyword <em>targeting <\/em>and keyword <em>stuffing<\/em>. It\u2019s important to mention your keyword and demonstrate relevance to YouTube, but you shouldn\u2019t harp on it to the point of writing bad copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">SEO for YouTube video tags<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The final attributes I want to mention before moving on to our fourth tip are your <strong>video tags<\/strong>. Unlike your title and your description, your tags are invisible to YouTube users (except for those who use a special Chrome extension, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/vidiq.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vidIQ<\/a>). You\u2019re not required to tag your videos, but you absolutely should\u2014it\u2019s an easy, harmless way to further demonstrate your relevance to YouTube\u2019s algorithms.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20video20tags.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube video tags\" width=\"800\" height=\"338\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see here, it\u2019s advisable that you use your video tags to target your primary keyword as well as close variations of it. This will help you rank for search queries that don\u2019t literally contain your target keyword, yet signify the same basic intent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: YouTube Video tags are different from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/20\/youtube-hashtags\">YouTube hashtags<\/a>\u2014which are also important in your video strategy!<\/p>\n<div id=\"connect-with-youtube-creators\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">4. Link up with other content creators<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just because you and another content creator are going after the same audience, doesn\u2019t mean your relationship needs to be adversarial. In fact, I\u2019d encourage you to forge a <strong>symbiotic <\/strong>relationship\u2014i.e., a relationship that benefits both of you. Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of YouTube content marketing is to create value for viewers and expand your pool of top-of-funnel prospects. If you ask me, your capacity to accomplish that goal is in no way diminished by the presence of a competitor.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20content20creators.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube content creators\" width=\"800\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Throwback to a great collaboration between <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pM5hIhxyOUo\"><em>WordStream and Hanapin<\/em><\/a><em>!<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, how do you get more YouTube views while establishing symbiosis with another content creator who\u2019s targeting the same audience? Simple: You create a piece of content <strong>together<\/strong>. If, for example, you were to appear as a guest star in one of your competitor\u2019s videos, you would benefit from the exposure to a group of users who may not have previously encountered your brand. At the same time, your <em>competitor <\/em>would benefit from the additional traffic driven by your promotion of the video. All the while, YouTube users benefit from a stellar piece of content. In this scenario, everybody wins!<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"use-youtube-cards\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">5. Use cards and end screens<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Watch time is a fantastic indicator of viewer engagement. In general, the further someone gets into your YouTube video, the more interested they are in whatever it is you\u2019re saying. And if someone is highly engaged with your content, it follows that they\u2019re open to watching more of your videos. That\u2019s why our fifth tactic for getting more YouTube views is taking advantage of cards and end screens. Let\u2019s take a quick look at each feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Cards<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A YouTube card is a banner-esque notification that appears in the top right corner of your video and alerts your viewers to a related piece of content. It\u2019s an easy, effective way to capitalize on high user engagement and promote another video without diminishing the quality of the viewer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Think of each card as the YouTube equivalent of an internal link within one of your blog posts. Although, yes, you\u2019re being self-promotional, you\u2019re also directing your viewers to a piece of content that they can benefit from. Once again, we have a win-win scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20cards.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube cards\" width=\"800\" height=\"539\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">End screens<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">An end screen, much like a card, is meant to direct your most engaged viewers to a related piece of content. As the name suggests, an end screen appears as your video is winding down.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20end20screen.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube end screen\" width=\"800\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to promoting a video or two, I suggest using an end screen to encourage your viewers to subscribe. The more subscribers you accumulate, the more people YouTube will notify when you upload a new video.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"write-accompanying-blog-post\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">6. Write a blog post to accompany each video<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/24\/blogging-tips\">blogging<\/a> is already part of your content marketing strategy\u2014and it should be\u2014why not write a blog post to accompany each of your YouTube videos? Yes, this <em>does <\/em>require an additional time investment, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. It\u2019s an easy way to introduce your website visitors to your YouTube channel and drive an increase in viewership. Plus, for all those prospects who would rather watch than read, the inclusion of a video is a surefire way to improve the quality of the user experience. And since you\u2019re already sitting down to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/12\/video-scripts\">write a script<\/a>, the additional effort required to create a corresponding blog post is extremely low.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here&#8217;s an example of this from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/31\/negative-match-types\">one of our own blog posts:<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get20more20youtube20views20use20with20blog.png\" alt=\"get more youtube views use with blog\" width=\"800\" height=\"541\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Accompanying each YouTube video with a blog post is a super easy win.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">On top of all that, let\u2019s not forget the potential SEO benefits. As Search Engine Land columnist Wesley Young <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/rise-video-8-tips-boost-sites-seo-227498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out<\/a> all the way back in 2015, \u201cvideo is evidence of quality content, and as part of a media mix on a site, it helps send signals to search engines that your page or site contains rich media relevant to search requests.\u201d In other words, embedding a YouTube video at the end of a blog post is an effective way to tell Google and Bing that you\u2019re going the extra mile to provide value to users.

Add timestamps to your video descriptions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The YouTube search bar isn\u2019t the only channel for users hoping to discover relevant content. Indeed, it\u2019s quite common for people to stumble upon YouTube videos by way of Google. This shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, as many queries yield videos in the search results.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20timestamp_0.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube timestamp\" width=\"800\" height=\"672\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To help search users more easily find the information they\u2019re looking for, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/key-moments-video-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> in September 2019 that they\u2019ll link to key moments in YouTube videos directly on the SERP.

Get the word out on social media<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Nothing groundbreaking here, folks\u2014sometimes the basic stuff yields the best results. A key step towards getting more views on YouTube is using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media<\/a> to promote new content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s the problem: This is the one item on our list that <em>everyone <\/em>does. Not everyone knows about YouTube SEO. Not everyone is willing to link up with a competitor. Not everyone cares about producing legitimately valuable content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Juuuust about everyone uses social media to promote their YouTube videos. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get creative with your tactics. Let\u2019s talk about three steps you can take to ensure that you stand out on social.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Give your followers a substantial preview<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For reasons I\u2019ll never understand, some marketers believe that the key to success\u2014whether in the form of views, clicks, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">conversions<\/a>, or whatever\u2014is to give away as little as possible. These folks will encourage you to give your social media followers the scarcest preview imaginable, so as to not \u2026 dilute the actual product, I guess? Like I said, I\u2019ve never understood the rationale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Regardless, I think this philosophy is utter nonsense. You can\u2019t succeed with content marketing if you\u2019re unwilling to be generous with your insights\u2014not only because you\u2019ll miss out on opportunities to build brand affinity, but also because you\u2019ll fail to actually promote your content. Why should someone leave Twitter and head to YouTube if they\u2019re unsure that your video will actually help them? If you want to stop people in their tracks and get them to watch the entirety of your YouTube video, you need to give them a substantial preview on social.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20preview.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube preview\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Promote your YouTube videos in the way Brian Dean promotes his blog posts.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Join the conversation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Another great way to promote a YouTube video via social media is to find people who are already talking about whatever it is your video addresses.

Now, take a look at this:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20twitter.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube twitter\" width=\"500\" height=\"194\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I found this tweet by searching \u201cgrow tomatoes\u201d on Twitter. If you were trying to get more views for your how-to video, why not reply to this user with a link? It\u2019s targeting marketing\u2014for free!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Reach out to industry influencers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One last tip for social media promotion: If there are individuals in your industry with large, dedicated followings, try to get in touch with them! Getting an endorsement from a relevant influencer\u2014even something as simple as a retweet\u2014can do wonders for your brand authority. And when you\u2019re trying to grow a business through content marketing, authority is everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Believe it or not, there are influencers everywhere\u2014not exclusively in the worlds of fashion and fitness. Let\u2019s stick with the example of a garden-related ecommerce website. Google \u201cgardening blog\u201d and you\u2019ll likely stumble upon a website called <a href=\"http:\/\/yougrowgirl.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You Grow Girl<\/a>\u2014a blog about plants, food, and artwork. The woman behind the site, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yougrowgirl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gayla Trail<\/a>, has nearly 17,000 followers on Twitter. An endorsement from her would be huge for our imaginary brand!<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20influencers.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube influencers\" width=\"600\" height=\"387\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Influencers. Are. Everywhere.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I say all that to say this: If you doubt the efficacy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/19\/influencer-marketing-content-promotion\">influencer marketing<\/a> in your specific industry, do a little digging. It took me less than three minutes to find Ms. Trail. What\u2019s the harm in trying?<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"make-creative-youtube-thumbnails\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">9. Don\u2019t skimp on your thumbnails<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Some people will deliberately search for your content. Others will stumble upon it via your social channels or your website. A few folks may even find your videos by way of friends sending links.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Inevitably, however, many people will encounter your YouTube videos simply by browsing the platform in search of something to watch. Without compelling, unique thumbnails that pique your prospects\u2019 interest, you won\u2019t get as many views as you\u2019d like. With that in mind, let\u2019s briefly talk about what it takes to create an effective <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-thumbnail-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube thumbnail<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20knit20a20blanket.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube thumbnail\" width=\"800\" height=\"237\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before you shoot your next video, do a YouTube search for your target keyword and see what other creators have used for their thumbnails. You want to stand out from the pack, so it\u2019s wise to find out what you\u2019re going up against before hitting record. That being said, the number one rule of YouTube thumbnails is that <strong>you must faithfully represent the content of your video<\/strong>. Using your thumbnail to deceive users into clicking is a big no-no\u2014one that will cost you in the long run, as tanking watch times translate into lower rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Perhaps the best way to communicate the DNA of a strong YouTube thumbnail is to analyze an example. Take a look at this one from Vox:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20thumbnail.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube thumbnail\" width=\"800\" height=\"155\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s start by addressing the all-important question: <em>Does this thumbnail faithfully represent the content of the video? <\/em>I suppose you\u2019d have to watch the video to know for yourself, but you\u2019ll have to trust me for now. <em>Yes<\/em>, this thumbnail is completely appropriate. The video addresses a widespread misconception about the power of Vitamin C to cure the common cold. By centering the thumbnail around five everyday items that people typically use to combat the sniffles, Vox gives us an accurate preview of what will be discussed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What this thumbnail <em>doesn\u2019t <\/em>do is use controversial imagery or language to elicit an extreme emotional response from YouTube users. There\u2019s no implication that Airborne is a completely fraudulent product. There\u2019s no unpleasant image of an extremely sick person. It\u2019s a simple, colorful thumbnail that grabs your attention and sets appropriate expectations for the corresponding video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Word to the wise: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">The specs for YouTube thumbnails are 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 ratio). You\u2019ll need a .jpg, .png, .bmp, or .gif file.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"write-good-youtube-titles\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">10. Think hard about your titles<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The title of your YouTube video, much like the thumbnail, requires a substantial degree of forethought. Although it\u2019s unethical (and ultimately counterproductive) to use your video title to trick users into clicking, you <em>do <\/em>need to write something enticing. All those discovery-minded users? The folks who are browsing YouTube in search of something to watch? They\u2019ll scroll right past you if your title fails to capture their attention and spur them into action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The goal, in other words, is to find a healthy middle ground between dry and dishonest. We\u2019ve got some ideas as to how you can make that happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Focus on the outcome<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What will viewers walk away with after watching your video? What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value or benefit<\/a> do they stand to capture? How will your insights change their everyday lives? Ask yourself these questions while you brainstorm titles and you\u2019ll eventually arrive at a winner.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20focus20on20the20outcome.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube focus on the outcome\" width=\"800\" height=\"144\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This video title promises a simple yet powerful outcome: <em>Watch this video and you\u2019ll walk away with the knowledge you need to <strong>get more leads <\/strong>for your business. <\/em>The creators could\u2019ve gone with \u201cLead Generation for Beginners,\u201d but that wouldn\u2019t have made the benefits of watching the video quite so obvious.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Use specific, impressive numbers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">People like numbers. Numbers are familiar. Tangible. Easy to understand. And when used correctly, numbers can be extraordinarily enticing. Case in point:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20use20numbers.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube use numbers\" width=\"800\" height=\"144\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Maybe it\u2019s just the content marketer in me, but if you wouldn\u2019t click on this video, I think you\u2019re out of your mind. Here we have a textbook example of using a specific number to make a video title exponentially more interesting. 850% is not only a <em>large <\/em>number\u2014it\u2019s also a fairly <em>uncommon <\/em>number. How often do you come across an instance of 850% in your everyday life? I\u2019m willing to bet that it\u2019s rare, and the marketing team at SEMrush is undoubtedly aware of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">P.S. This is another example of emphasizing outcome in a video title. <em>Watch this video and you\u2019ll walk away with the knowledge you need to <strong>increase organic traffic <\/strong>by 850%.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Appeal to user curiosity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">People like numbers, but perhaps not as much as they like knowledge. We\u2019re curious beings. We want to be in the know. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an evolutionary explanation for this characteristic of ours, something about hunter-gatherers needing to gossip in order to survive. Regardless, the final insight of the day is this: Using your video title to <strong>appeal to user curiosity<\/strong> is a time-tested way to get more views on YouTube. You shouldn\u2019t write clickbait, of course, for the reasons I\u2019ve discussed ad nauseam. As long as your title reflects the content of your video, you\u2019re golden.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20title20optimization.png\" alt=\"how to get more views on youtube title optimization\" width=\"800\" height=\"141\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Of all the examples I\u2019ve shared throughout today\u2019s guide, this one might take the cake. The first half of the title targets a keyword, and the second half creates one heck of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/curiosity-gap\">curiosity gap<\/a>. If you want to earn high rankings <em>and <\/em>entice relevant users, this right here is a winning formula.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 <strong>Want more copywriting psychology insights?

What works for one YouTube creator won\u2019t necessarily work for another. Whereas influencer marketing may do wonders for my YouTube views, you might find it best to focus on optimizing your thumbnails and partnering with other channels. It depends entirely on your unique circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The one insight I hope <em>everyone <\/em>takes to heart is that <strong>creating value for viewers <\/strong>always takes precedence over everything else. Does producing unique, high-quality content guarantee thousands of views every month? No, it doesn\u2019t\u2014there are additional steps you need to take in order to succeed. But without that foundation of truly valuable content, nothing else we\u2019ve talked about today will matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">On that note, go make a
