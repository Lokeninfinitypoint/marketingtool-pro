Virtually all of them run branded search campaigns (search campaigns that use variations of your business name as keywords), and about one in 10 complain that their brand keyword costs per click (CPCs) are too high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, that may sound on trend considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordStream&#8217;s recent search benchmark data<\/a> shows that average cost per click has increased for 61% of industries and saw a general year-over-year increase of 5%.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart.jpg\" alt=\"brand keywords - google ads costs year over year\" width=\"842\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77057 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart-480x341.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Download the full<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 2023 Google Ads benchmark report<\/a> here.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, keep in mind that brand keywords historically have had a significantly cheaper cost per click than your typical non-branded keywords. That, coupled with the fact that branded keywords convert at a <a href=\"https:\/\/hawksem.com\/blog\/branded-vs-non-branded-keywords\/\">100%<\/a> higher rate than non-branded keywords, it&#8217;s no wonder that businesses want to make the most of these terms with the best bang for their buck.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel like you&#8217;re in the same boat where your branded keyword costs are high, but you don&#8217;t want to give up on them just yet, you&#8217;re in luck. <span>Here are five of the most common reasons why your branded keywords costs per click are high this year, and how to fix it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5 issues causing high brand keyword costs (and how to fix them)<\/h2>\n<p>Use this guide to diagnose and treat your Google Ads branded keywords with unusually high costs:<\/p>\n<h3>1. You messed up your <span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">match types<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>The most common culprit of high CPCs in a branded search campaign is\u2026you\u2019re not actually advertising for queries that align with your brand name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve entered your branded keywords into your search campaign like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span>joe\u2019s awesome business<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><span>joe\u2019s business<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span>That\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/29\/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broad match<\/a>, and it tells Google that you want to advertise on user searches that <em>are related to the concept of <\/em>Joe\u2019s Awesome Business. It does NOT tell Google that you want to advertise when people are specifically searching for your business; you would need to use phrase match or exact match for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to know if you\u2019ve messed up your match types<\/h4>\n<p><span>In <strong>Google Ads<\/strong>, go to<strong> Keywords<\/strong>, then click <strong>Search keywords<\/strong>. Then, look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Match Type<\/strong><\/a> column and ensure it says <strong>Phrase Match<\/strong> or<strong> Exact Match<\/strong> next to every keyword in your branded search campaign. Even if you think you used the right match type, it\u2019s easy to accidentally leave off a quotation mark or bracket, leaving you with unintentional broad match keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type.jpg\" alt=\"branded keywords - keyword match type column screenshot in Google Ads\" width=\"641\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77062 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type.jpg 641w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type-480x449.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 641px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Use this free guide to find more ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteHackingGoogleAds.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_HackingGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hack Google Ads for better performance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. You\u2019re not adding negatives<\/h3>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, just because you have the right match types, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re only advertising on your branded queries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Over the last year, Google has gotten much more liberal with its definition of a \u201cclose variant\u201d match\u2014so liberal, in fact, that I\u2019ve heard reports of Google Ads matching <em>competitor names<\/em> to brand names, even when using phrase or exact match.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re using the keyword <em>\u201cjoe\u2019s awesome business\u201d <\/em>and Sara\u2019s Fabulous Shop is down the street, selling similar products. Google might match a search for &#8220;<em>sara\u2019s fabulous shop&#8221;<\/em> to your <em>\u201cjoe\u2019s awesome business\u201d<\/em> keyword, even though we can all agree that this would not fit our definition of a matching phrase. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If Google\u2019s algorithm understands the similarity between these two competitors, it will treat them as synonyms, turning your branded search campaign into a competitor search campaign! And, of course, CPCs on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitor keywords<\/a> are always quite high due to low <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a>, and potentially high competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to know if you\u2019re not adding negatives<\/h4>\n<p><span>In Google Ads, go to <strong>Keywords<\/strong>, then click on <strong>Negative keywords<\/strong> to see if any negatives have been added to your branded search campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Whether they have or not, you\u2019ll want to go to <strong>Keywords<\/strong>, then <strong>Search terms<\/strong>, and sort descending by the Impressions column for the last 30 days (or 90 days, if your search volume is quite low).

Your competitors are bidding on your brand<\/h3>\n<p><span>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got the right match types, you\u2019re adding negatives as needed, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Terms Report<\/a> looks good and your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/07\/18\/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPCs are <em>still<\/em> high<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The next most common culprit is that your competitors are bidding on your brand, so there\u2019s competition for your brand keywords. (Less common, but also possible, is that you have such a generic brand name that you\u2019re bidding against other businesses for customers that may or may not even be looking for you.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>While this is annoying, it\u2019s perfectly legal as long as they aren\u2019t using your trademarks in the text of the ad itself. The best way to get rid of them is to keep defending your brand\u2014ensure you have over a 90% <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/07\/impression-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impression share<\/a> in your branded search campaign. By doing so, you\u2019ll drive up <em>their<\/em> CPCs to the point that it won\u2019t be profitable for them to bid on your brand anymore, and <em>your<\/em> CPCs will subside once they exit the auction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to know if your competitors are bidding on your brand<\/h4>\n<p><span>Don\u2019t Google yourself! In Google Ads, go to <strong>Keywords<\/strong>, then <strong>Auction insights<\/strong>. If your competitors are bidding on your brand, you\u2019ll see their domains show up here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png\" alt=\"brand keywords - auction insights example\" width=\"936\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72497 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights-480x166.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. You picked the wrong bid strategy<\/h3>\n<p><span>Keywords aren\u2019t the only possible reason for high CPCs. Perhaps the reason you\u2019re paying too much for your brand keywords is that you\u2019ve picked the wrong<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> bid strategy<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Google Ads Recommendations will often suggest Target Impression Share, but in my experience, this is a surefire way to blow through lots of budget. I prefer to use Maximize Clicks or Maximize Conversions for branded search campaigns, but these solutions won\u2019t work for every account and can sometimes lead to higher CPCs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If your CPCs are really out of control, switch to Manual CPC with enhanced CPC turned on, and start by setting a Max CPC that\u2019s 25% lower than your actual CPCs. Monitor your Search <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/07\/impression-share\">Impression Share<\/a> carefully (especially if there are competitors in your auctions), and gradually reduce your bids in 25% increments to bring your CPCs back down.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to know if you picked the wrong bid strategy<\/h4>\n<p><span>In Google Ads, when you\u2019re in a campaign (not an ad group), go to Settings on the left-hand side to see which bid strategy you\u2019re using.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"brand keywords - bid strategy selection example\" width=\"927\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77065 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot-480x163.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. You have a Quality Score issue<\/h3>\n<p><span>The amount you pay per click is a function of both your bids and your <em>quality<\/em>. Though not as common in a branded search campaign, it\u2019s worth checking to see if you have a Quality Score issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Perhaps you didn\u2019t include your brand name in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad copy<\/a>, so your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rate<\/a> is lower than it should be. Or perhaps your ads are fine, but your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landing page<\/a> is so poor that it\u2019s hurting your Quality Score, and in turn, driving up the CPC Google will require from you for the privilege of showing an ad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In a branded search campaign, your Quality Score for every keyword (if reported) should be a 9 or 10.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to know if you have a Quality Score issue<\/h4>\n<p><span>In Google Ads, go to<strong> Keywords<\/strong>, then <strong>Search keywords<\/strong>. Add the following 4 columns to your report: Quality Score, Expected CTR, Ad relevance, and Landing page experience. Quality Score (if reported) should be a 9 or 10 for each keyword; Expected CTR and Ad relevance should both show &#8220;above average,&#8221; and Landing page experience should be &#8220;average&#8221; or &#8220;above average.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-quality-score.jpg\" alt=\"branded keywords - quality score columns\" width=\"900\" height=\"227\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77066 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-quality-score.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/branded-keywords-quality-score-480x121.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Consider all options for brand keyword optimization<\/h2>\n<p>Clearly, the factors at play when it comes to your brand keyword costs go beyond the typical keyword settings.
