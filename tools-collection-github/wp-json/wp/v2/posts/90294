Get discounted marketing tools<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever saved money by visiting an online marketplace that offers discounts on popular things like computer hardware or name-brand fashions? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nikiya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nikiya Griffith<\/a>, director of content marketing at <a href=\"http:\/\/teamohana.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TeamOhana<\/a>, pointed out similar options for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\">marketing software<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Keeping an eye on marketplaces like AppSumo that offer steep discounts on software can really help stretch a budget,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Especially if you&#8217;re a solopreneur or small business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is #notanad for AppSumo, but I did take Nikiya\u2019s advice and had a look through the <a href=\"http:\/\/appsumo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AppSumo<\/a> website. I started by using its AI personal shopper.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-png.webp\" alt=\"Stretch your marketing budget - screenshot from AppSumo\" width=\"803\" height=\"274\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90296 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-png.webp 803w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-480x164.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It gave me a handful of options, including an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-ai-photo-generators\">AI image generator<\/a>, an AI brand marketing platform, and an AI-powered text-to-speech app\u2014all at discounted prices.<\/p>\n<p>Besides software, there are courses and PDFs listed on the site as well. And there\u2019s a tab labeled \u201cShop Last Call,\u201d which looks to be extra special last-minute deals.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Speaking of discounted tools&#8230;<\/strong>we have some free ones for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Grader<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\">Facebook Ads Grader<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Keyword Tool<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"befriend-your-finance-team\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Befriend your finance team<\/h3>\n<p>The typical trope is that marketers and finance teams work against each other. One group is tasked with spending money to get customers, and the other is judged by how judiciously it protects a business&#8217;s bottom line. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kristinblitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kristin Blitch<\/a>, director of marketing at <a href=\"https:\/\/rjeinteriors.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RJE Interiors<\/a>, believes there\u2019s a better way to approach this relationship.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to sound silly, but befriend your finance team,\u201d she said. \u201cOur CFO is one of my closest allies, so I work with the team to see where I can cut expenses and make sensible savings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kristin added that her partnership with finance makes it easier to try new strategies. &#8220;When I ask to spend money, trust has been built that it&#8217;s not just something on a whim,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;There&#8217;s intentionality and reason behind it. From there, I can make things work and bring new things to the table because we&#8217;ve usually got a plan in place.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One constant challenge for marketers is proving the value of our actions to the rest of the team. Having an ally in finance who understands what you do and why you do it would be a big step in alleviating that challenge.<\/p>\n<div id=\"leverage-your-internal-influencers\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Leverage your internal influencers<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re producing big-budget, celebrity-filled commercials, your biggest marketing costs aren\u2019t tied up in the creative\u2014it\u2019s paying for the distribution channels (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/18\/social-media-advertising\">paid social media ads<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Kristin has a solution for that, too. &#8220;I work to have our internal team help us share our communications (especially the important ones) externally to improve reach in conjunction with any boosting or advertising,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re launching a new product or starting a new campaign, you could ask your team to post about it on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/generating-leads-on-linkedin\">LinkedIn<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-png.webp\" alt=\"Stretch your marketing budget - RJI LinkedIn repost.\" width=\"784\" height=\"792\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90297 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-png.webp 784w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-480x485.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 784px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Internal influencing can be as easy as asking your team to repost important company updates.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve written about the power of internal influencers before (it was one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-marketing-tips\">top tips from expert marketers<\/a> for 2025). They\u2019re a fantastic way to expand the reach of your marketing messages without extra ad costs.<\/p>\n<p>Kristin said they can also add a trust layer to your marketing. \u201cHaving authenticity and word of mouth from our team to their followers (directly) means more compared to just paying for the clicks.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"dont-overspend-on-seasonal-campaigns\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Don\u2019t overspend on a few seasonal campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>As an experienced digital marketing consultant at <a href=\"http:\/\/localiq.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LocaliQ<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mkaywood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miranda Kaywood<\/a> gets a behind-the-scenes view of how businesses allocate their marketing budgets. She cautioned against spending most of your advertising dollars on a few seasonal campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of exhausting your budget all at once, I recommend pacing it out to maintain consistent visibility,\u201d she said. \u201cConsistency is crucial for building long-term brand recognition, as it requires multiple touchpoints with consumers to create meaningful connections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is true even for seasonal businesses. Say you run a lawn care service. Many of your competitors will turn marketing on in March as the weather gets warm. If you\u2019ve shared a steady stream of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/winter-content-ideas\">helpful content all winter<\/a>, the people it helped will be more likely to choose you come <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/spring-content-ideas\">spring<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And once you get a revenue bump from those successful gambits, compound it by putting some of it back into advertising. \u201cInvest in these solutions, and once you see a positive ROI, reinvest the returns back into your marketing strategy through a budget increase or trying out different marketing avenues,\u201d Miranda said.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Want to keep your growth going?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">Always On Marketing: The Not-So-Secret Strategy for Unstoppable Growth<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"target-2nd-or-3rd-google-ads-positions\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Target second or third Google Ads positions<\/h3>\n<p>The top spot on a Google search results page almost always gets the most clicks. But that real estate comes at a price. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/adamschwind\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam Schwind<\/a>, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/sparkdigitalgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spark Digital Group<\/a>, believes there\u2019s gold in not fighting the big spenders for those extra clicks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRather than competing for the number one spot in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a>, where costs can be significantly higher, businesses can maximize their budget by targeting the second or third position,\u201d he said. \u201cThis approach reduces cost per click (CPC) while still maintaining strong visibility and competitive click-through rates (CTR), ensuring a better return on ad spend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I really like this bit of advice. I\u2019ve watched the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\">search ad costs<\/a> we track yearly rise. Just in the last four years, the average cost-per-lead from our benchmark reports jumped by roughly 50%.<\/p>\n<p>Adam\u2019s suggestion is a great option for tempering those cost increases to keep your budget intact.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1<strong> Free budget-saving resource:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\">6 Easy Ways to Save Money on Google Ads Now<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"be-ready-to-pivot\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Be ready to pivot<\/h3>\n<p>Experimentation is a constant part of great marketing. What\u2019s important, Miranda said, is to make sure you\u2019re not doubling down on the experiments that don\u2019t pan out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s key to regularly check in and see what\u2019s actually working so you can understand how your marketing dollars are being spent,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou might discover that some platforms, ads, or audiences perform better than others\u2014and you need to pivot to make sure you\u2019re always effectively using your dollars.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s true whether you manage your own marketing budgets or have outside help. \u201cYour marketing partner (i.e., LocaliQ) can help with this, but it\u2019s important for you to stay on top of it, too,\u201d Miranda added.<\/p>\n<p>A great place to start is while creating your yearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">marketing strategy<\/a>. Be precise about which metrics matter to you most in the coming year. Set a benchmark based on your industry and on your prior results. Then, establish a cadence for review and be prepared to shift your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-budget\">budget<\/a> from what\u2019s not working to what is.<\/p>\n<div id=\"be-strategic-with-your-marketing-channels\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Be strategic with your marketing channels<\/h3>\n<p>It can be tempting to jump into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\">marketing channel<\/a> that gets a lot of buzz from other businesses. Adam said that can lead to a leaky marketing budget if it\u2019s not the right channel for your unique brand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSmall businesses must be strategic about where they invest their marketing budget,\u201d Adam explained. He gave the example of a divorce law firm, which may not benefit as much from building a large following on every social channel since \u201cdivorce clients seek legal help when needed, not ongoing engagement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miranda made a similar point. \u201cSmall businesses should focus on a few key marketing channels, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/08\/facebook-marketing-ideas\">Facebook<\/a> and Google, rather than trying to cover everything with a limited budget,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-1024x979.webp\" alt=\"Stretch your marketing budget - chart social media channels.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"979\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90310 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-1024x979.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-300x287.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-768x734.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-1536x1468.webp 1536w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-2048x1957.webp 2048w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-1080x1032.webp 1080w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-1280x1223.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-980x937.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/popular-social-media-platforms-logo-4-480x459.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Not all channels are ideal for all audiences.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Which channels are right for your business?<\/p>\n<p>To answer that you\u2019ll need to know who your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">most valuable audience<\/a> is and figure out how they typically learn about brands and services in your industry.

Know your customer<\/h3>\n<p>Both Colby and Kristin told me that knowing your customer is one of the most important steps in getting more from each marketing dollar.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe single most important aspect of marketing is understanding your customer better than your competitors,\u201d Colby said. \u201cDo not assume your customers think the same way you do. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">Send out surveys<\/a>, pick up the phone and call them, dive into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">Reddit threads<\/a>, do whatever you can to understand the pain points they have relative to your business and how you help solve them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-png.webp\" alt=\"Stretch your marketing budget - screenshot from Reddit.\" width=\"956\" height=\"719\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-90300 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-png.webp 956w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-480x361.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 956px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Reddit is a great place to see what questions your target audience is asking.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>He offered a systematic approach to the task. \u201cWe recommend completing voice of customer and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">competitor research<\/a> to better understand the rational and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional motivators<\/a> that best resonate with your audience,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom there, we\u2019d select 3-5 motivators to test over a 90-day period. When analyzing ad creative performance, we generally start by looking at the high level to understand how performance averaged based on the messaging motivators, ad format, creative design style, UGC Creator, etc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Kristin, knowing your customer gives you the freedom to be creative and play a little. \u201cKnow your target audience and know how and where to reach them,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you know how to reach them, have fun. It\u2019s scary to make the first video that feels like it might be different, but do it. Having fun is the ultimate way to engage your followers. Once you find something that works, keep tweaking it and having fun.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>You don\u2019t have to turn off marketing to stay on budget<\/h2>\n<p>One big takeaway from all of these tips is that you don\u2019t have to stop marketing to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-advertising-costs-in-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">save money on advertising<\/a>. Actually, keeping a consistent presence on your top channels can help reduce overall costs compared to stopping and starting.<\/p>\n<p>The theme I picked up on was the need to be agile.
