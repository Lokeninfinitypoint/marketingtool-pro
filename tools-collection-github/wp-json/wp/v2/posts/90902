We&#8217;ll dive deeper into how to do this in the next section!<\/li>\n<li>Find other targets. If you\u2019re losing traffic for informational searches where more AI Overviews are showing, you may need to double down on optimizing for more transactional searches. For example, if you\u2019re losing traffic for \u201chow much does pest control cost in {city}?\u201d you may need to invest in different terms where those AI Overviews aren\u2019t present, like \u201cpest control companies in {city}.\u201d In some cases, these terms that are more transactional or commercial and less informational will have less top-line traffic, but they may bring more conversions.<\/li>\n<li>Consider other channels. If you have a limited sphere of search terms that will drive relevant traffic, you may need to recalibrate your expectations for SEO as a channel. Investing in another channel, particularly if it\u2019s something like video or PR that can also impact SEO, may have better results for you than some of your content creation and link-building efforts had previously.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"rank-in-ai-overviews\"><\/div>\n<h2>How you can impact AI Overview rankings<\/h2>\n<p>So let\u2019s assume you do have AIOs in the search results for your target keywords. What can you do about it?<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/appearance\/ai-overviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>Google&#8217;s systems automatically determine which links appear. There is nothing special for creators to do to be considered other than to <strong>follow our regular guidance for appearing in search, as covered in Google Search Essentials<\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/richsanger.com\/google-ai-overview-study-link-selection-based-on-related-queries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rich Sanger<\/a> did another study of AI Overviews (with somewhat different findings from those highlighted above) but found two interesting takeaways:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cSERP Position and AI Overview Visibility: The likelihood of a search result document appearing in an AI Overview depends on its SERP position. A link ranked first has a 53% chance of being featured, while content ranked tenth has a 36.9% chance. This trend holds for related and reformulated queries as well, with higher-ranking documents more likely to be included.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Trends in Unaccounted Links: Further analysis of the unaccounted links revealed a significant presence of YouTube and Wikipedia, highlighting specific domains that AI Overviews favor.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In other words, a lot of the work of getting featured in AI Overviews is to <strong>do the things you already knew you should be doing to rank in Google search results<\/strong>: Target relevant terms, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/27\/backlink-audit\">build links to your domain<\/a> and individual pages, write clickable title tags, and create a great user experience on your site so that your engagement metrics are strong.<\/p>\n<p>Another key aspect of AIOs to note is that they change based on the user\u2019s history and location, as well as engagement with an AIO by users generally.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the above-the-fold experience for me for the same search in Chrome in one Google profile:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\"

were performed within a few seconds of each other at the same location, and while the mobile and desktop results are very similar, the wording is slightly different, a few of the sources varied from desktop to mobile, and it\u2019s likely this result will change over time (and from searcher to searcher).<\/p>\n<p>So, like with all search engine rankings, you need to take into account that results will be personalized and dependent on user interaction with the AIO itself.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond existing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO best practices<\/a>, there are some areas you can focus on, particularly when it comes to AIO placement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/richsanger.com\/ai-overview-optimization-insights-from-googles-patent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verification and embedding distance<\/a>. If you\u2019re targeting something like a definition for a term (e.g., what is X), having your definition of the term match the AIO with slightly different but highly similar \u201cclose\u201d language helps increase the likelihood of being sourced in the AIO links.<\/li>\n<li>Updating content and timestamps. Freshness is among the factors relevant patents from Google considers when it comes to AIOs.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-knowledge-panel\">Knowledge graph inclusion<\/a>. This is one of the sources the LLM powering Google\u2019s AIO results pulls from (along with its index).<\/li>\n<li>Related topics. AIOs will change over time based on how an individual user or users generally refine their query, so having related topics is important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, a lot of these <strong>are things you\u2019re likely doing already<\/strong> as part of your typical SEO process.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay ahead of the AI Overview curve<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you need to make adjustments to try to rank in AI Overviews now or are taking the wait-and-see approach, every site that is investing in and generating revenue from search traffic should continue to keep an eye on:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How many AI Overviews are showing up in their search results. While AI Overviews aren\u2019t being used in localized search results now, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be over time.<\/li>\n<li>Changes in best practices around AIOs. If it becomes evident that they\u2019re being impacted more by a specific factor, it may make sense to invest more heavily in optimizing for that specific element.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And, as always, keep up with the latest SEO news and updates so you can make tweaks and changes as needed.
