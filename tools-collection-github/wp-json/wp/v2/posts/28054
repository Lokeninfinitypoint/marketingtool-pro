(And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">here&#8217;s how Google Ads works<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Of course you might think I\u2019m a little biased since I\u2019m writing for the WordStream blog. But I work here because of my deep-rooted love of PPC, and I truly believe Google Ads can work for almost any business: small, medium, or large.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout my time at WordSteam I\u2019ve heard every excuse in the book as to why Google Ads doesn\u2019t work, including \u201cMy leads don\u2019t know how to use the internet\u201d (<em>like, REALLY dude!?<\/em>). My 95-year-old great aunt knows how to use Google, so I\u2019m really not buying this one. I can only begin to image what our sales reps hear on a day to day basis. I can remember one of the first clients I worked with trying to back me into a corner as to how this could possibly work for her business. Essentially, she wanted me to re-sell her the idea of <a href=\"\/paid-search\">paid search marketing<\/a>\u2026 It was our second call\u2026 I wasn\u2019t about to go into a sales pitch (the result would be a lot of um\u2019s, uh\u2019s, wells \u2013 I\u2019m not a sales person).<\/p>\n<p>Instead I\u2019d like to address the most common arguments we hear about why Google Ads doesn\u2019t work, and provide some counterarguments to show you why it actually DOES work. Because the fact is, Google is one of the most profitable companies on the planet for a reason \u2013 <a href=\"\/articles\/most-expensive-keywords\">Google makes money<\/a> from Google Ads because people keep using it! Check out how much money some of the <a href=\"\/articles\/google-earnings\">biggest spenders on Google Ads<\/a>\u00a0spend annually \u2013 $40 to $50 million a year!

Yes, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">Google Ads does cost money<\/a>, and often when advertisers start out they might not allocate all of their marketing dollars to the right places, leaving them with a loss of faith in the platform. But it\u2019s important to remember that all marketing channels cost money; the question is whether or not you\u2019re getting return on that investment. Before abandoning Google Ads as a lost cause they should identify why it is costing so much.<\/p>\n<p>More often than not when I look at new client accounts, they have let their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/14\/adwords-gdpr\">Google Ads account<\/a> run on auto-pilot or let an unqualified third-party run their account, and therefore, yes, they\u2019re wasting a ton of money.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things you can do to make Google Ads\u00a0less expensive and more profitable.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn how to use it<\/strong>: This is the number one reason <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/23\/five-ppc-account-leakages\">people are usually wasting money<\/a> \u2013 because they haven\u2019t taken the time to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/22\/learn-adwords\">learn Google Ads<\/a>. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a self-explanatory, easy-to-understand system. It takes time, studying, and experience to <a href=\"\/learn\">understand the ins and outs of paid search<\/a>. Spend time reading, watching instructional webinars, understanding things like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/adwords-account-structure\">account structure<\/a>, <a href=\"\/keyword-match-types\">match types<\/a>, negative keywords, bidding strategies, and if you\u2019re super ambitious get <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/06\/google-adwords-advanced-exam-tips\">Google Ads certified<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-google-adwords-work-ppc.png\" alt=\"Does Google AdWords work. Image of PPC University.\" width=\"858\" height=\"189\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use more restrictive match types<\/strong>: Are all of your match types on broad? Well, bingo, that\u2019s why Google Ads\u00a0is so darn expensive! With broader match types your ads are more likely to be served to a much larger, and sometimes irrelevant audience, leading to wasted clicks. I\u2019m not advising that you stop using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/03\/broad-match-type\">broad match keywords<\/a>, but make sure to set up negatives to block irrelevant searches, bid on phrase and exact keywords at higher bids to get more relevant clicks, and regularly monitor your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/01\/29\/five-negative-keyword-tips\">Search Query report<\/a> to get a sense if you\u2019re bidding on the keywords people are actually searching for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set a realistic budget &amp; bidding strategy: <\/strong>Determining <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/03\/higher-bids-fewer-clicks\">budgets and bids<\/a> can be a full-time job in itself, but don\u2019t over-complicate the process. Map out what you\u2019re realistically able to spend on each campaign and set your daily budget accordingly. What about bidding? For budget conscious advertisers I always recommend <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/11\/never-use-automatic-bidding-in-adwords\">bidding manually<\/a> to have the most granular control over your account without letting Google run the show.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure you\u2019re not on Search with Display Display Select: <\/strong>Being on search and display can work great for the advertiser looking to get the most visibility and branding possible, but often users blindly chose this option and end up confused as the how their daily budget was depleted so quickly. Well, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">the display network<\/a> is taking your ads and showing them across the web rather than just in the search results. The intent is different when browsing the web compared to doing a search, so typically I recommend splitting these campaigns and having separate strategies and budgets for each.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-google-adwords-work-search.png\" alt=\"Does Google AdWords work - screenshot of selecting Search Network only.\" width=\"308\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Track spend<\/strong>: There can be so many reasons your spend gets out of control. Perhaps your keywords are triggering irrelevant clicks, or you\u2019re using automated bidding that is quickly depleting your budget, or an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/23\/google-hummingbird\">algorithm update<\/a> caused your spend to skyrocket. The main point here is that you need to be extremely active and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/25\/ppc-plan\">review KPI\u2019s and spend on a daily basis<\/a>, even if you set aside just 10 minutes per day. If you do this, you\u2019ll be guaranteed to not waste money on irrelevant clicks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Argument #2: We have great SEO so we don\u2019t need to pay for clicks<\/h2>\n<p>Oh, do you now? I laugh out loud, legitimately, out loud when I hear this argument (yes, I\u2019ll put the client on mute whilst laughing). I refuse to believe this argument for several reasons, the main being that study after study can back up the fact that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/25\/ppc-plan\">paid search complements good SEO<\/a> and increases overall profitability.<\/p>\n<p>I recently attended <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/04\/heroconf-takeaways\">HeroConf in Portland, OR<\/a>, where Bing Evangelist John Gagnon shared an interesting case study of an account that saw <strong>32% gain in brand clicks from bidding on their keywords rather just relying on SEO to get the top spots<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-google-adwords-work-data.png\" alt=\"Does Google AdWords work? Image showing graphs of branded click growth when combining SEO with PPC\" width=\"608\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Yup, <strong>you should even be bidding on your own brand terms<\/strong> because your competitors likely are doing so, and therefore you\u2019ll want to steal these clicks from them (it\u2019s your OWN brand for heaven\u2019s sake! And these clicks tend to be very cheap).<\/p>\n<p>Further, when you want to target new keywords in organic search, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/28\/why-are-popular-keywords-so-hard-to-rank-for\">it can take a long time<\/a> for your content to rank \u2013 and sometimes, it just never does. But you can target new keywords with PPC right away, then determine very quickly if they\u2019re worthwhile, profitable keywords for you.<\/p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">different types of keywords<\/a> with different levels on intent drive different search behavior. SEO is great for informational searches and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">top of the funnel<\/a> traffic, but search queries with high commercial intent tend to deliver very different SERPs with a lot more ads \u2013 sometimes nothing <em>but<\/em> ads above the fold. And for those types of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">high-intent<\/a>, high-converting keywords, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/05\/product-listing-ads-stealing-conversions\">ads are often stealing most of the clicks<\/a>. People may never get to your organic result at the bottom of the page.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the thing about great SEO is that it isn\u2019t 100% reliable. You can follow all of the best practices, but top rankings aren\u2019t guaranteed. Also, remember Penguin and Panda? No? Well, many marketers remember these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/24\/google-algorithm-update-changes\">Google algorithm updates<\/a> clearly because they plummeted their organic traffic, leaving them in a puddle of panic. With PPC the control is in your hands. But <strong>the real winning formula is optimizing your site and content for SEO purposes, whilst implementing an effective paid search strategy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-google-adwords-work-seo.jpg\" alt=\"Does Google AdWords work?

In all seriousness, this is a legitimate problem, but I know from experience that with effective management you can turn your paid search efforts into a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">conversion generating machine<\/a> (unless your business is doomed to fail for lacking a quality product or offering).<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/13\/dear-ebay-its-not-adwords-its-you\">eBay faced a similar dilemma<\/a>, threw their hands up, and made the bold claim that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/28\/google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a> doesn\u2019t work. In response, they received a lot of backlash from marketers and business owners laughing in their faces and deeming eBay\u2019s marketing team na\u00efve and uninformed. The reality is eBay just sucks at paid search. Sorry eBay, I know I\u2019m being a bit harsh, but let\u2019s explore the reason why some companies, like eBay, fail to get conversions from paid search.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your account is structured poorly: <\/strong>Often times advertisers aren\u2019t seeing conversions because there account is a disaster zone. Perhaps they\u2019re targeting keywords that are either too broad, not relevant, or have awful quality scores. They\u2019re likely not using negative keywords to block irrelevant searches, and their ad groups are probably stuffed with unrelated terms. Follow <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/adwords-account-structure\">this guide to set up your account structure<\/a> properly because the way your account is structured is the building blocks to achieving results with paid search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re abusing <\/strong><a href=\"\/dynamic-keyword-insertion\"><strong>dynamic keyword insertion<\/strong><\/a>: The problem with eBay\u2019s Google Ads account was clear: \u201ceBay\u2019s Google Ads strategy appears to be to pick every possible word in the dictionary and run them on Dynamic Keyword Insertion,\u201d says Larry Kim. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/17\/dynamic-keyword-insertion-guide\">Dynamic keywords insertion<\/a> is an option in Google Ads\u00a0where you can dynamically insert a query searched for on Google into your ad to make the ad as relevant as possible and increase click opportunity. This strategy can work wonders if done well, but eBay abused DKI by bidding on irrelevant keywords and using them with DKI. Just look at the old example below that Larry shared for a search done for a perpetual motion machine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/does-google-adwords-work-example.png\" alt=\"Does Google AdWords Work? Screenshot from eBay's poor use of DKI\" width=\"647\" height=\"221\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Seriously? Be careful! If you\u2019re new to Google Ads you might want to steer clear of DKI until you\u2019re a bit more comfortable. It\u2019s downright embarrassing to show up for unrelated terms.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your ads aren\u2019t relevant<\/strong>: Ah yah! Relevancy can\u2019t be stressed enough when it comes to Google Ads. Your keywords need to match your ads which need to match your landing page. If you searched for a pair of new sneakers and were directed to a landing page with hats you\u2019d probably bounce back, and lose faith in that brand. This tip might seem obvious, but you\u2019d be surprised at how many people group together a large set of keywords, directing to a specific ad not directly related to the keywords searched for, that then leading the searcher to their homepage. No wonder conversions aren\u2019t coming in!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your landing pages suck: <\/strong>This one is often hard for marketers to stomach. Break your ego down a bit, and come to the realization that your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a> might, well, suck\u2026 I know, I know, you spent hours upon hours designing them or perhaps you paid a contractor to create them. Well, if you\u2019re getting clicks, but no conversions, it could be a landing page issue. <a href=\"\/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=185\">Read up on best practices<\/a> to revamp your landing pages, and don\u2019t be afraid to run A\/B tests to try out variations of a page. You might be surprised by the results!<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re not remarketing: <\/strong>Oftentimes, especially with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/23\/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies\">B2B companies with longer sales cycles<\/a>, you can\u2019t rely solely on gaining conversions through search. You need to take it a step further. The easiest, and what I\u2019ve found to be the most successful way to do this is with remarketing. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">Cookie your site visitors<\/a> and follow them around with relevant offers.

Yes, I understand paid search can be time-intensive, and if you\u2019re not dedicating the proper time to evaluate, track, and tweak your PPC campaigns then your results could plummet or never arrive. What can be done? Well, nowadays there are so many tools and systems that can help drastically <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/19\/ppc-agency-strategies\">reduce the time spent on paid search<\/a>. For instance, at WordStream we offer a tool called the <a href=\"\/20-minute-work-week\">20 minute work week<\/a>, which scrapes through your Google Ads account to identify areas that need improvement, for instance an ad that isn\u2019t performing well, or a keyword that\u2019s brining in irrelevant traffic and should be set as a negative. Make your life easier by implementing a time-reducing system to help you along the way. Here are seven more tips to help you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/06\/adwords-shortcuts\">save time in Google Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, stop making excuses! Google Ads\u00a0<em>does<\/em> work as long as you\u2019re putting in the effort to do it well.
