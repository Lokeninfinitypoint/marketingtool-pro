Fields like law, psychotherapy, programming, and more have already been impacted, and we are sure to see even greater impacts in the coming months and years.<\/p>\n<p>But what about marketing? Well, the written word is a crucial component to so many facets of marketing, from blogging, to copywriting, to SEO, online advertising, and much more. And not only can ChatGPT generate intelligent text in a heartbeat, but it can also generate intelligent <em>ideas<\/em>. And ideas are the lifeblood of marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt homepage with sample prompts\" width=\"936\" height=\"549\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-homepage.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-homepage-480x282.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing: you can\u2019t generate ideas <em>or <\/em>text that will help you market your business without a prompt.

For example, you can add links to your website or content, provide a specific tone you&#8217;re hoping to achieve, and more. The more information you provide ChatGPT, the better result you&#8217;re likely to get.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follow up.<\/strong> ChatGPT is different from some other AI models in that it can answer follow-up questions and continue a conversation. If you don&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re looking for in your first response from ChatGPT, follow up with specific questions or more specific prompts to drill down and get a better answer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I said, you can treat ChatGPT as if it were an assistant, which means carrying on a conversation and essentially coaching it through what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n<div id=\"social\"><\/div>\n<h2>ChatGPT prompts for social media<\/h2>\n<p>Use these prompts to get <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/engaging-posts-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media ideas<\/a>, posts, and tips from ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<h3>1.

Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Keyword research ideas<\/h3>\n<p>ChatGPT isn\u2019t a substitute for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keyword tool<\/a>, but it can help you identify keywords or phrases to do some deeper keyword research on. Try this prompt to get started:<\/p>\n<p><em>Give me a list of informational, long-tail keywords that I can use to ideate blog posts for [product or company].<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Result:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-keyword-research.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt keyword research prompt\" width=\"771\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-keyword-research.jpg 771w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-keyword-research-480x372.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>ChatGPT is handy for keyword ideation, but it\u2019s not going to give you keyword volume or difficulty.

Generating meta tags<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re stuck trying to write the perfect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">meta description<\/a>, let ChatGPT help. You can use the response you receive as a starting point. Here&#8217;s a prompt to try:<\/p>\n<p><em>Write me a meta description, under 160 characters, for the blog post [title].<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Result:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-meta-description.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt prompt for meta description\" width=\"936\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-meta-description.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-meta-description-480x221.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All those endless hours filling out meta descriptions in spreadsheets are over.<\/p>\n<p>Well, you still have to fill them out.

Blog post structuring<\/h3>\n<p>In terms of content, this is probably the best use case for ChatGPT. It&#8217;s a great way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/12\/seo-automation\">automate SEO<\/a> because it delivers really excellent post structures with minimal prompting. And if you want more control over your structure, you can of course give it those inputs. Start with this prompt:<\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m writing a blog post for my roofing company called [title]. How should I structure the post?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Result:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-blog-post-structure.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt prompt for blog post structure or outline\" width=\"872\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71564\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-blog-post-structure.jpg 872w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-blog-post-structure-480x329.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is helpful because, while we don\u2019t recommend having ChatGPT write your content for you, it can be an asset when it comes to outlining your posts and giving you a foundation to build on with your own unique content.
