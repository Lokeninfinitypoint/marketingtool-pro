If you don\u2019t know, Reddit is the internet\u2019s collective subconscious, a platform where folks from all walks of life can go to talk about their experiences, post content, and learn about topics that interest them.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its relative lack of structure compared to other social media platforms, Reddit doesn\u2019t get a ton of love among business owners looking to promote their products and services.

Subreddits typically include topics like technology, news, movies, and gaming, but really, a subreddit could exist for <em>virtually any subject imaginable<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of Reddit\u2019s key features:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subreddits<\/strong>. As mentioned, these are individual communities within Reddit, each dedicated to a particular topic. They are denoted by the prefix &#8220;r\/&#8221; followed by the topic name, r\/memes, r\/dankmemes, and r\/WatchPeopleDieInside (we told you, there\u2019s a subreddit for everything.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Posts and comments.<\/strong> Posts within subreddits include text, links, images, and videos. Users then comment on these posts to create threads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Voting system.<\/strong> Reddit uses an upvote and downvote system that allows users to \u201crate\u201d content. Posts and comments with more upvotes appear higher on the page, increasing their visibility, while those with more downvotes become less visible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Karma<\/strong>. Users earn karma points when their posts or comments are upvoted. Karma serves as a rough measure of a user&#8217;s contributions to the community.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Moderation<\/strong>. Each subreddit is moderated by a team of volunteers who enforce community-specific rules and Reddit&#8217;s overall content policies. They have the authority to remove posts, ban users, and manage discussions within their subreddit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reddit Gold\/Premium<\/strong>. Reddit offers a premium subscription service called Reddit Premium, which provides an ad-free experience, access to a private subreddit, and other perks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The main draw of Reddit is precisely that: it\u2019s open. As long as users follow the rules of a given subreddit, they are allowed to post candidly about whatever topic intrigues them. For that reason, people not only flock to Reddit for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/19\/brand-community\">community<\/a>, but to find unfiltered answers to questions that they may not be able to find anywhere else on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Posing a question on Reddit is like posing it to an enormous, virtual living room of interested parties. The answer may not always be what you want, but you\u2019ll get no shortage of opinions.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-is-reddit-important\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#why-is-reddit-important\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why is Reddit important?<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>Because of its diverse user base and wide range of content, Reddit is an extremely popular platform for discussing current events, sharing personal stories, and seeking advice.

Give your products and services away<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<p>As we mentioned at the start of this post, Reddit is the internet\u2019s collective subconscious. Its superego. And if there\u2019s one thing the ego loves, it\u2019s free stuff. The idea that you, the consumer, are worthy of receiving something of value in exchange for absolutely nothing.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to promote your products and services in a subreddit, hosting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">giveaway<\/a>, sweepstakes, or contest is perhaps the most effective way to do so. This strategy allows marketers to deflect the ill will typically shown to users who self-promote while igniting a competitive interest among potential customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp\" alt=\"example of mod approved reddit giveaway\" width=\"663\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83996\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp 663w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products-480x317.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 663px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/11\/google-local-service-ads\">service business<\/a>, this could mean giving away a free inspection or a discount on one of your services. If you\u2019re an ice cream shop owner, it could mean going to your local subreddit and posting a two-for-one special. If you&#8217;re an ecommerce brand, it could mean driving traffic to an external <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>, where users can enter their names and email in exchange for entering to win a gift package from your brand.<\/p>\n<p>However you choose to give your products and services away, you can rest assured that doing so will help you drive invaluable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-competitors\">traffic<\/a> and exposure for your business.<\/p>\n<div id=\"cultivate-a-following\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#cultivate-a-following\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5.

Thought leaders like Jason Calanicas and Elon Musk use Reddit to grow their brands by being thought leaders. They run companies and have business interests, but they use Reddit as a means of swiftly growing their engaged audience.<\/p>\n<p>Pop over to Jason\u2019s Reddit profile and you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s not just posting about his podcast. He\u2019s actively engaging in a number of discussions on a variety of topics he is interested in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp\" alt=\"example of Jason Calanicas reddit profile\" width=\"665\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83997\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp 665w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following-480x432.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 665px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Why would a guy worth $100 million spend his time perusing subreddits?

The ability to pop into a thread at any time and offer a relevant fact, opinion, critique, or piece of advice, is what makes Reddit such a unique and useful platform for content creators and brands alike.<\/p>\n<h2>Traffic on Reddit belongs to the most engaged and creative<\/h2>\n<p>There you have it, in a nutshell.
