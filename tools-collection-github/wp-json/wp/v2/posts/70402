Experts can then respond to these queries, and the journalist can then quote them in the article and will often provide a backlink to their site (if applicable). <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/haro-query-example.png\" alt=\"haro query example\" width=\"462\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-70546\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of a query in HARO<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Journalists can come from well-known publications, making HARO a great means of <a href=\"https:\/\/splintereconomics.com\/why-is-link-building-important\/\">link building<\/a>, which is crucial for SEO, while also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">building your brand awareness<\/a> and media coverage.

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to walk you through now. Here&#8217;s a basic template I recommend: <div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Hi [NAME] My name is [NAME], and I have spent much of my career working as a [RELEVANT ROLE] ] at [COMPANY]. In [X years] of working in this industry, I have [LIST ACHIEVEMENTS]. Here\u2019s my take on your query: Start every pitch following this outline, and you will quickly notice more responses from journalists and new backlinks to your website. Thanks in advance, [NAME]<\/div><\/div> Some things you\u2019ll notice:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address them by name.<\/li>\n<li>Thank the journalist for their time.<\/li>\n<li>Say that you are willing to follow up\/be interviewed (don\u2019t worry, journalists will virtually never do this, but it\u2019s good to ask)<\/li>\n<li>Say thanks in advance.

Check the media outlet\u2019s domain rating<\/h3>\n<p>Domain rating, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a>\u2014depending on which SEO platform you\u2019re using\u2014is an expression of your website\u2019s SEO value. When you\u2019re looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/21\/b2b-link-building\">build backlinks<\/a>, the higher the backlinker\u2019s DR, the more it will help you to increase yours. That being said, checking the DR of the media outlet in question will help you to identify whether pitching to this journalist will be worth your time.<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/website-authority-checker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/a> <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png\" alt=\"domain rating in ahrefs\" width=\"650\" height=\"207\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53633\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png 650w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs-480x153.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/website-authority-checker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs\u2019 Free Website Authority Checker.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Only respond to relevant queries<\/h3>\n<p>Hundreds of HARO queries get posted every day, so you should only respond to those for which you have relevant experience (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/05\/seo-trends\">experience is now part of Google&#8217;s E-E-A-T formula<\/a>, by the way!). In the example above, you can see in the requirements that Cynthia is looking for consumer analysts, so if you are one, have conducted research in the field, or have a relevant degree, you may be the perfect match.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Show your credentials<\/h3>\n<p>On that note, make it clear right away that you are a quality and credible source for them. State your credentials and relevant experience right away. And don\u2019t underestimate the power of your own credibility. You don\u2019t have to be Elon Musk to get a link from The New York Times!<\/p>\n<h3>4. Respond within 30 minutes<\/h3>\n<p>Time is of the essence for journalists, so being proactive with your responses is crucial. Most queries on HARO will have a pitch deadline, but the best advice is to try to be the first one to respond. Journalists are often looking for a quick quote to plug into their articles and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">press releases<\/a>. They want convenience, not a life story. Play to this and try to respond to a query within 30 minutes. Fast responses win HARO links! <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/submit-new-pitch-haro.png\" alt=\"submit new pitch on haro\" width=\"504\" height=\"380\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-70549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/submit-new-pitch-haro.png 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/submit-new-pitch-haro-480x362.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/byjessicala.com\/help-a-reporter-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Make it quantifiable and\/or quotable<\/h3>\n<p>Journalists will take you much more seriously if you can reference <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a> and statistics that back up your input. For example, instead of saying \u201cFocusing on B2B sales is important\u201d try \u201cFocusing on B2B sales can lead to a 138% year-over-year return.\u201d Also, be quotable. Try and visualize your response in a Forbes article. Does it fit or sound clunky? Quotable excerpts are intelligent and memorable but brief and to the point. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">Being clear and concise with your copy<\/a> will make it easier for journalists to select your pitches over others.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t follow up until after you get a response<\/h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t get a response, the journalist has probably deleted your pitch because you\u2019re not qualified and time is of the essence. Don\u2019t keep chasing them. This will signal to the journalist you are just desperate for backlinks and\/or media exposure and they\u2019ll avoid you in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Don\u2019t expect every pitch to succeed<\/h3>\n<p>On HARO, a success rate between <strong>5-10%<\/strong> is fairly common. Some specialists can get this a bit higher, but no one will acquire media coverage and a strong backlink for every pitch. Stay positive and consistent with your HARO pitches. You can even delegate this to one of your employees if needed. But please don\u2019t give up after writing a few pitches! It\u2019s not about the quantity of links you build but the quality of the links\u2014and the quality of the relationships! Which is my next tip. <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - how backlinking link juice is transferred\" width=\"720\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice-480x317.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Focus on relationships<\/h3>\n<p>HARO isn\u2019t a one-way street. It\u2019s give <em>and<\/em> take. Focus not on building backlinks, but on building relationships with journalists. Share the article with your network, and follow up with journalists to thank them, let them know you\u2019ve shared it, and offer to help with new articles.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Track your success<\/h3>\n<p>As you know, not all links are created equally. Context, relevancy, and authority all influence how search engines determine a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">website&#8217;s ranking power<\/a>. Create a spreadsheet to track your success. It can be as simple as \u201cPublication Name\u201d and \u201cYes\/No\u201d or it can be a little more sophisticated (like this one). <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png\" alt=\"haro backlink tracking spreadsheet\" width=\"720\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70547\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker-480x245.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/> This will help you measure, optimize, and scale your link-building efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Sign up for Google Alerts<\/h3>\n<p>On a similar note, it\u2019s a good idea to sign up for Google Alerts so that you will get a notification every time you earn a new link. Also, be sure to regularly run site searches and check SEO tools to find new backlinks. <div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>Speaking of SEO tools, have you used our <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Website Grader<\/a><\/strong>?

Use it as a larger backlink strategy<\/h3>\n<p>In the same way that different backlinks hold different levels of value, there are also many different ways to build links besides HARO. Other ways to build backlinks include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/21\/guest-posting-dos-donts\">guest posting<\/a>, niche content, statistic posts, infographics, content syndication, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnets<\/a> like free tools.
