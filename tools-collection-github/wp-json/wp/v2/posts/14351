It also decreases the odds you\u2019ll waste ad spend on uninterested eyeballs and help move potential customers down the proverbial funnel.<\/p>\n<p>And it yields results. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tammy_herd?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tammy Duggan-Herd<\/a>, director of marketing at digital marketing firm Campaign Creators, for example, after shifting to a content strategy with audience targeting in 2016, her agency saw a 744% increase in organic traffic within 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to better target your prospective customers\u2014and stop wasting ad spend on people who just won\u2019t convert\u2014you&#8217;ve came to the right place. Today, I&#8217;ll walk you through eight tried-and-true audience targeting strategies\u2014straight from the minds of digital marketing experts.<\/p>\n<p>But, before that, you need data \u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Data management is key to audience targeting<\/h2>\n<p>Heather Jackson, sales and marketing manager at digital advertising firm JAC Advertising Consultants, pointed to data management platforms like Lotame and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.home.neustar\/\">Neustar<\/a>, which track consumer behavior online with cookies.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-data-management-platform.jpg\" alt=\"data management platform example\" width=\"753\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cBased on their online behavior \u2026 these aggregators can, with extreme accuracy, decipher the demographics, interests and preferences of an individual,\u201d she said. \u201cMarketing giants, such as Facebook and Google, use this data to pinpoint an exact audience for their marketing clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A word of caution: Stephen Yu, chief product officer at predictive marketing automation platform Buyer Genomics, said cross-platform\/channel strategies can yield disappointing results as \u201ctargeting by definition must be individual-centric, not channel- or product-centric.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he said to <strong>start with the individual target, including demographics, online behavior, purchase history, repeat purchases and loyalty<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of this information should be collected through every engagement channel \u2026 and resultant data must be consolidated around the individual target first,\u201d Yu added. \u201cThen, marketers can decide whom to target based on data profiles, segments and other model-based targeting mechanisms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And once you have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">figured out your target audience<\/a>, you can start thinking about channels.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToo many organizations mix channel optimization and target optimization, but those are two equally important endeavors: the former to determine where the marketing dollars should go, and the latter to determine whom to target,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>But you\u2019re not finished yet! Audience targeting has to be refined regularly because \u201cyou\u2019re basically hypothesis testing,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ckazanis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cynthia Kazanis<\/a>, digital marketing analyst at internet marketing agency Pure Visibility. \u201cEspecially in digital marketing, you should never think of anything you create as permanent or done because then you lose the advantage of your platforms&#8217; agility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, keep asking questions about your audience targeting:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are we reaching the audience we want?<\/li>\n<li>If not, who are we reaching?<\/li>\n<li>Is the intended audience responding the way we want?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a similar audience the target can help us find?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Psychographics<\/h3>\n<p>For his part, Tim Brown, marketing insights manager at marketing agency Pacific Digital Group, recommended using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/16\/psychographics-in-marketing\">psychographics<\/a>\u2014values, affinities and motivations\u2014as a more accurate targeting goal than demographics.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-psychographics-2.jpg\" alt=\"psychographics image\" width=\"693\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can uncover psychographics using social analysis tools to search follower bios for attributes, which you can then use to create content that speaks to their lifestyles, priorities, and attitudes.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve determined how you\u2019re going to gather, track, and manage your data, you can start improving your audience targeting.<\/p>\n<h2>Audience targeting strategies from the experts<\/h2>\n<p>Now, here\u2019s a closer look at eight audience targeting strategies used again and again by digital marketing experts.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Expand reach with Google\u2019s In-Market Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Dale Broadhead, founder of PPC and CRO agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.conversionhut.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conversion Hut<\/a>, expressed genuine love for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/13\/google-display-network-targeting-facts\">display campaigns in Google Ads\u2014<\/a>particularly when targeting an audience that hasn\u2019t heard of his business before. In fact, Google\u2019s in-market audiences feature lets you target consumers who are researching your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe use a not-so-well-known report from our Google Analytics reports to find the highest performing Affinity Categories and In-Market Segments. Once we have our insights, we can then build different ad groups around each of the audiences and create messaging that resonates with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis works because you are making decisions that are backed by data \u2026 We&#8217;re finding out who the best customers are and then going out to try and find more of them.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-google-in-market-audiences.jpg\" alt=\"Google In-Market audiences\" width=\"718\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2497941?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>\u2019s audience targeting options.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Kim Smith, content marketing manager at review platform GoodFirms, agreed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/31\/in-market-audiences-for-search\">in-market audiences<\/a> are the ones that are already out there, searching, reading, comparing, or even planning to buy a product or service, just not engaged with your brand directly or indirectly,\u201d she said. \u201cWith past searches, keyword activity and browsing behavior of the user, machine learning can predict what a user is interested in and when would he be ready, to convert effectively \u2026 Ideally, in-market targeting aims at widening your reach with high buying intent and offers a practical customer acquisition strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. Remarket with Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>David Reischer, chief marketing manager at legal advice website LegalAdvice.com, spoke highly of audience targeting in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn Google Ads Editor, a marketer can download, view, and assign existing audiences. Depending on our campaign type, we can target <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">remarketing lists<\/a>, custom combination lists, life events, and interest categories. It is an amazing tool,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle [Ads] allows a marketer to do lots of A\/B testing and set up &#8216;ad clusters&#8217; to compare which campaigns are most effective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bmliving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Becky Livingston<\/a>, president and CEO of Penheel Marketing, which is an agency focused on small businesses, also, remarketing as a way to helps brands connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-tips-remarketing.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday marketing tips remarketing diagram\" width=\"632\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Creating remarketing lists is particularly effective for targeting an audience that has already expressed interest in your product or service.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Are you taking advantage of all that Google Ads has to offer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>3. Use Facebook custom audiences and retargeting<\/h3>\n<p>Robb Hecht, adjunct professor of marketing at Baruch College, however, said despite Facebook\u2019s data privacy woes, it remains the social platform with the widest selection of formats to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\">target<\/a>, reach and engage potential customers because it is \u201ca personalized\u00a0data platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of Facebook&#8217;s core features is giving businesses the capability to target users on the platform based on their interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides users with only relevant ads based on their preferences. It doesn&#8217;t bombard them with irrelevant stuff. In this way we are able to build content and ads that our users really value.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-facebook-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ad example\" width=\"496\" height=\"541\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Hecht noted Facebook users have short attention spans, so his clients have found short videos to be the most effective format. And once the user engages with the ad, he is able to retarget that consumer with another ad to draw them further down the tunnel.<\/p>\n<p>Laura Troyani, principal of marketing and sales strategy agency PlanBeyond, said advertisers can use Facebook\u2019s back-end ad platform to set up demographic and psychographic parameters to ensure ads reach the right audience, as well as to track performance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy looking at click-through rates, cost-per-clicks, and actual conversions, you can start seeing which audience is most attracted to your product or service and how much money it will take to reach them,\u201d she said. \u201cArmed with black-and-white data, business managers can make truly informed decisions about their business&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target customer<\/a>. It&#8217;s a fantastic way to frugally, cost-effectively do market intelligence.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. Try LinkedIn for keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>Mike Grill, SEO strategist at <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-marketing\/how-does-search-engine-marketing-work\">search engine marketing<\/a> agency Anvil Media, agreed social media platforms often offer the best and most expansive audience targeting capabilities, which he said Anvil can then transfer to the search engines that \u201cdon\u2019t have quite the same data or features.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>One of the most effective audience targeting strategies has been translating job title targeting to keyword research.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the profiles of different professionals with job titles that we have been targeting on LinkedIn and scraped the content on their LinkedIn profiles to come up with keyword lists that we have then used to make our search campaigns and audiences much more robust,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like looking at reviews on an ecomm website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Adam Smartschan, vice president of innovation and strategy at B2B marketing agency Altitude Marketing, too, advocated for \u201crelatively pedestrian options\u201d like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\"> LinkedIn<\/a> sponsored content, native content and site-based display targeting.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-linked-in-event-ad.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn ad example\" width=\"549\" height=\"562\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cToo many marketers ignore networks like these because they&#8217;re considered pedestrian,\u201d he added. \u201cIn reality, though, they&#8217;re great options for testing messaging, getting campaigns off the ground and reaching specific targets quickly and\u00a0extremely\u00a0cost-efficiently.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>5. Prioritize SEO<\/h3>\n<p>According to Ade Holder, digital marketing consultant at digital marketing agency 427 Marketing, organic SEO is the best audience targeting there is because \u201cthere is nothing better than simply being in front of the customer when they search for exactly what you are able to offer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If your brand ranks high for relevant terms, it is targeting everyone actively searching for your products and services.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-seo.jpg\" alt=\"SEO for audience targeting\" width=\"735\" height=\"577\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAlso, search is often a signal of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">buying intent<\/a> whereas targeting ads to demographic data and tastes is always hoping you may get them at the right time,\u201d he added. \u201cWith search they have already shown they are looking by typing it in.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>6. Add chatbots to your plan<\/h3>\n<p>For his part, Cristian Rennella, CMO of price comparison site ElMejorTrato.com, said site visitors interact with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/14\/chatbot-marketing\">chatbot<\/a> the brand created internally using open source machine learning framework TensorFlow so they can determine if visitors are in its target audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-chatbot.jpg\" alt=\"chatbot for audience targeting example\" width=\"446\" height=\"195\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most important lessons we have learned is that a team marketing analyst must be frequently controlling the decisions that the algorithm is taking,\u201d he added. \u201cIn this way,\u00a0the algorithm can be refined and educated more quickly<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>based on the knowledge the company had in the past.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>7. Start tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Adding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/21\/adwords-event-tracking\">event tracking<\/a> to your site shows you how visitors are interacting with your site and can help you build a more effective online presence, Livingston said.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-targeting-event-tracking.jpg\" alt=\"event tracking\" width=\"698\" height=\"226\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Jackson said marketing companies can capture phone IDs and serve ads based on geography\u2014including location up to six months ago\u2014with just latitude, longitude and date.<\/p>\n<p>And Smartschan said one of his goals for 2019 is to effectively leverage B2C technologies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/geo-targeting\">geotargeting<\/a> and geofencing to reach B2B prospects based on physical location.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Keep looking forward<\/h3>\n<p>These are the audience targeting strategies that top marketers are currently using to find and reach their ideal customers. But with technologies rapidly changing, it\u2019s important to keep looking forward to find new strategies.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Marie Lamonde, content marketing specialist at\u00a0marketing reporting tool DashThis, said she is most interested in using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">voice search<\/a> to target audiences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m intrigued to see where audience targeting is going with those new technologies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can be a new and amazing way of targeting our audiences.\u00a0I think we can find new and revolutionary ways to target our audiences, which could drastically change our ways as marketers.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Audience targeting enables you to reach consumers interested in your business.
