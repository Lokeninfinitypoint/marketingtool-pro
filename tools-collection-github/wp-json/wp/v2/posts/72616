You can create content to inspire, educate, persuade, convince, argue, support, express, and the list goes on. What kind of content? Well, that list can go on too.

Here are some of the common forms of content creation in marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO content creation<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO content<\/a> creation refers to writing keyword-targeted articles and website pages. Keywords are the words and phrases your ideal customers are typing into Google. There are several <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page optimizations<\/a> you can perform so Google knows to serve up that page for those searches\u2014and to get your audience to click on your result.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-keyword-placement-onpage-seo.jpg\" alt=\"on-page seo keyword placement graphic\" width=\"877\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-keyword-placement-onpage-seo.jpg 877w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-keyword-placement-onpage-seo-480x328.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f Free guide!\nDownload now &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download\">The Big, Easy Guide to Keyword Research<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>Blog content creation<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">Blog content creation<\/a> involves writing high-quality, keyword-targeted, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form articles<\/a> (lotta hyphens there) on topics relevant to your audience. The goal is to rank for those keywords, generate qualified traffic to your website, demonstrate your expertise, and gain trust from potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>But not all blog content creation has to be SEO-focused. Many businesses use blog posts to share product and service updates and also give a look inside their culture and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Social media content creation<\/h3>\n<p>Social media content creation is just as important as SEO content creation, but it has less to do with keywords and more to do with the appearance and delivery of the information. The best social media posts are visually appealing, easy to digest quickly, and have personality.<\/p>\n<p>Social media content creation will vary according to the social media platform you\u2019re creating content for\u2014a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">great Facebook post idea<\/a> is going to be different from that of Instagram, which will be different from that of LinkedIn, TikTok, or Reddit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/social-media-content-creation.webp\" alt=\"social media content creation \" width=\"490\" height=\"942\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/social-media-content-creation.webp 490w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/social-media-content-creation-480x923.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 490px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Video content creation<\/h3>\n<p>Video content creation runs the gamut of hour-long webinars, five-minute quick tips, three-minute <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">explainer videos<\/a>, 30-second TV commercials, 6-second bumper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\">ads on YouTube<\/a>, and even silent slideshow-style ads on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>While video is highly engaging, video content creation can be pretty resource-heavy.

But these methods all follow a pretty general process. Let\u2019s take a look:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Ideation<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to come up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/march-content-ideas\">topic ideas<\/a> for your content. That includes <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword research<\/a>, diving into your own website and social media analytics, consulting sales and support teams to learn FAQs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/16\/marketing-competitive-analysis\">competitive research<\/a>, and feedback surveys.

Planning<\/h3>\n<p>Content creation should not happen in just one session. There should always be some planning and preparation involved. Outline the key parts of the content so you can make sure it stays on track with the title and its purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">SEO-optimized blog post outlines and templates<\/a> will help you out here!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-seo-template.webp\" alt=\"seo content creation template\" width=\"477\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72623\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-seo-template.webp 477w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-seo-template-239x300.webp 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You may also want to establish timelines to keep yourself and others accountable.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Creation<\/h3>\n<p>Now is when you start populating your outlines and lists with, well, content! The meat and potatoes. My suggestion is to go freely here. You can always pare down later. With blog posts especially, you may even end up writing enough to produce a few different posts within a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/11\/pillar-pages\">topic cluster<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Editing<\/h3>\n<p>This is when you go back through and make sure the piece of content is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">Clear and concise<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Grammatically correct<\/li>\n<li>In the right voice<\/li>\n<li>Stays on track with the topic and goal<\/li>\n<li>Makes sense and is intuitive<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on your team size and methods, there may be a few phases within the editing stage. Just remember: done is better than perfect. With web content, you can always go back in and make updates or improvements.

This includes your website, emails, and social media platforms. And don\u2019t be afraid to resurface the same content periodically. Your audience is always growing.

Identify the who and why<\/h3>\n<p>Every piece of content should be created for a specific audience with a specific purpose. If you\u2019re going to do a webinar, for example, the topic you decide on, the presentation you create, the positioning of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails<\/a> you send, and the ads and social posts you create for it will all depend on who you want to attend and what your goal is with the webinar.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Establish levels of awareness<\/h3>\n<p>On a similar note, make sure you know the level of awareness of your target audience for each piece of content. Across the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer journey<\/a>, there\u2019s pain-point aware, problem aware, solution aware, and brand aware. Make sure you know what level of awareness your audience has for the particular piece of content you\u2019re creating so you can use the language that will resonate best.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-buyers-journey.webp\" alt=\"buyers journey\" width=\"936\" height=\"558\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72625\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-buyers-journey.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-buyers-journey-480x286.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have one, use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/19\/customer-journey-map-templates\">tips and templates to create a customer journey map<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Rely on data<\/h3>\n<p>All too often, content marketing gets misperceived as purely right-brain. But the truth is, if you want a truly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">lead-generating content marketing strategy<\/a>, there is a lot of math and data that goes into content creation. You\u2019ll need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention to keyword volume and competition levels.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">Establish content marketing KPIs<\/a> so you can set measurable goals for your content. For example, traffic numbers, conversion rates, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/20\/content-marketing-roi\">overall ROI<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Track <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">SEO metrics<\/a> such as time on page, page speed, backlinks, domain authority, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>More often than you\u2019d think, we come to find that we <em>thought<\/em> we knew what our audience would like best but the numbers show otherwise. Use data as your compass and let the creativity flow from there.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Create with repurposing in mind<\/h3>\n<p>The beauty of content is that there are so many forms of it that you can get a ton of mileage out of just one piece. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">Repurposing<\/a> is a content creator\u2019s best friend. Write a thorough, keyword-optimized blog post with images and you don\u2019t just have a blog post. You can make it into any or all of these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linked social post.<\/li>\n<li>Unlinked social post (such as just an image, excerpt, or stat for quick tidbits).<\/li>\n<li>A PDF guide (these make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">great lead magnets<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>A video or slideshow.<\/li>\n<li>A webinar.<\/li>\n<li>List item in a blog post roundup.<\/li>\n<li>Newsletter item.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-content-repurposing.webp\" alt=\"content repurposing chart\" width=\"720\" height=\"390\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-content-repurposing.webp 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/content-creation-content-repurposing-480x260.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/valchanova.me\/content-repurposing-methods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Focus on targeting topics that are super relevant to your audience (this is why the data matters!) and you\u2019ll find that creating a high volume of engaging content is not as hard as you think.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Stick to evergreen topics<\/h3>\n<p>On a similar note to the above, most of your content should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/16\/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing\">evergreen<\/a>. Content creation, no matter how easy you make it for yourself, is still time and energy exerted.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to make it worth every minute and dollar you spend is to focus on timeless topics that people will always be interested in, rather than trends and fads that will spike and then die out. It\u2019s easier to go in and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\"> spruce up evergreen content<\/a> from time to time than to constantly be chasing the hottest topics.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Keep a content library<\/h3>\n<p>On that last note, keep a library of all your content so that everyone on the team can have visibility into what exists. Not only will this ensure your content gets the most usage, but it will also prevent unnecessary recreation of content and proliferating content. This is a waste of time and your messaging will become inconsistent.<\/p>\n<p>Also, a content library allows you to keep track of updating that evergreen content.

Content creation doesn\u2019t happen in isolation. You\u2019ll have multiple pieces in development at once. An editorial calendar will help you to keep track of everything in progress, prioritize as needed, hold others accountable, and plan ahead of time. This planning is especially beneficial as it can help you to come up with monthly themes and keep your content extra\u2013cohesive.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/trello-editorial-calendar-template.webp\" alt=\"trello editorial calendar template\" width=\"720\" height=\"509\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/trello-editorial-calendar-template.webp 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/trello-editorial-calendar-template-480x339.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Establish a style guide<\/h3>\n<p>And finally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">have a style guide<\/a> so that anyone can jump in and help create content while keeping the brand messaging consistent. A style guide may include but is not limited to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tone of voice<\/li>\n<li>Vocabulary (terms that resonate, terms that don\u2019t)<\/li>\n<li>Grammar and literary preferences<\/li>\n<li>Dos and don\u2019ts for images<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Content creation summary<\/h2>\n<p>Welp, I can safely say that I just took part in content creation about content creation. M\u2019brain hurts. So I\u2019m going to leave it at that, but not before recapping the process and tips.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re creating SEO content, blog content, social media content, video, email, or B2B content, be sure to use these tips for content creation:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the who and why<\/li>\n<li>Establish levels of awareness<\/li>\n<li>Rely on data<\/li>\n<li>Create with repurposing in mind<\/li>\n<li>Stick to evergreen topics<\/li>\n<li>Keep a content library<\/li>\n<li>Have an editorial calendar<\/li>\n<li>Establish a style guide<\/li>\n<li>Follow the 5-step content creation process: Ideation, Planning, Creation, Editing, and Promoting<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With these tips and processes in place, you\u2019ll be well on your way to creating awesome content that drives your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals<\/a> and is worth your time and effort.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Find out how to create effective, engaging content that drives your business goals without costing you your sanity in the process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87,"featured_media":72631,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-72616","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-content-marketing"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Content Creation: Absolutely Everything You Ever Need to Know | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Content creation is the process of creating written, visual, or audio content.
