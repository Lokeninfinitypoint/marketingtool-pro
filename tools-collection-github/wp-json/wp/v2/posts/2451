They\u2019re the extra-special forces \u2013 the ones that implement killer strategies to turn the tide and defeat the enemy.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/guerilla-marketing-inspiration-1.jpg\" alt=\"guerrilla marketing inspiration\" width=\"400\" height=\"265\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Guerrilla marketing is a great alternative to traditional marketing. It thrives on original thinking and creativity, where imagination and ingenuity beat out big budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Guerrilla marketing tends to be cheaper than traditional marketing, relying on smaller, more <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/opening-new-location-7-ways-promote-it\/\">localized brick and mortar<\/a> strategies like:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Graffiti<\/h3>\n<p>Graffiti marketing uses city streets and alleyways as a giant canvas. While smaller, more covert operations will make their mark wherever they want, for most businesses it\u2019s recommended to get permission from a property owner before going Monet on the walls of their establishment.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/graffiti-marketing1-1.jpg\" alt=\"graffiti marketing\" width=\"491\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Guerrilla marketing, graffiti-style<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Stencil graffiti<\/h3>\n<p>Stencil graffiti uses stencils to create repeated works of street art. The advantage of stencils is that you can create multiple instances of your art across many different spaces in a short period of time. Stencils tend to be small in size (as opposed to a full-wall mural) and consist of simple designs.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Reverse graffiti<\/h3>\n<p>Reverse graffiti is when, instead of adding to a surface, marketers remove dirt and grime from a street or wall to create an all-natural marking message. Just put a stencil on a sidewalk and then wash the uncovered spaces!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reverse-graffiti-guerilla-marketing-1.jpg\" alt=\"reverse graffiti marketing\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A reverse-graffiti sidewalk ad<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Stickers<\/h3>\n<p>Creative use of stickers is another great guerrilla marketing tactic that can be very successful when implemented well.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Undercover marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Also known as \u201cstealth marketing,\u201d marketers disguise themselves as peers amongst their target audience. One example is Sony\u2019s campaign in 2002, in which actors were hired to wander about cities, asking strangers to take a photo of them. During the interaction, actors would rave of their cool new phone, boasting of its features and capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">Want more traffic to your site? Get our free guide: 25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6. Flash mobs<\/h3>\n<p>Flash mobs involve organizing a group of individuals to perform a specific action or task at a pre-determined location and time. In some cases participants are hired actors, other times they are simply members of the community who enjoy the randomness of flash mobs!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Publicity stunts<\/h3>\n<p>Publicity stunts involve specific feats of awe and amazement, usually sponsored or in partner with a brand. Red Bull is very adept at this practice, exemplified by their 2012 skydiving record as part of their Stratos project. Red Bull sent Austrian extreme-sports athlete Felix Baumgartner above the stratosphere, dominating the world record for highest skydive, launching himself from over 128,000 feet above earth. Arguably much more than a mere stunt, the Red Bull Stratos project set numerous world records and was viewed live on YouTube by over 9.5 million users (setting yet another record).<\/p>\n<h3>8. Treasure hunts<\/h3>\n<p>Creating custom, high-quality treasure hunts is another cool guerrilla marketing tactic that can energize audiences. Guerrilla marketing treasure hunts often involve posting online clues to hidden items scattered across a single or several cities. Winners are rewarded with digital codes, prizes, or a hint for the next level of the treasure hunt.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Urban environment<\/h3>\n<p>The most successful guerrilla marketing strategies make great use of the spaces around them. Urban environments allow for many opportunities to implement clever marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>While today we\u2019re mostly showing physical, visual examples of guerrilla marketing, there are plenty of online examples. Online guerrilla marketing campaigns often appear in the form of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viral videos<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\/\">User-generated content<\/a> competitions<\/li>\n<li>Creative landing pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Guerrilla marketing pros &amp; cons<\/h2>\n<p>Guerrilla marketing has some advantages and disadvantages. Take both into consideration before choosing to move forward with a campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Pros of guerrilla marketing<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cheap to execute.<\/strong>\u00a0Whether using a simple stencil or a giant sticker, guerrilla marketing tends to be much cheaper than classic advertising.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Allows for creative thinking.<\/strong>\u00a0With guerrilla marketing, imagination is more important than budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Grows with word-of-mouth<\/strong>. Guerrilla marketing relies heavily on\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word-of-mouth marketing<\/a>, considered by many one of the most powerful weapons in a marketer\u2019s arsenal. There\u2019s nothing better than getting people to talk about your campaign on their own accord.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Publicity can snowball<\/strong>. Some especially noteworthy or unique guerrilla marketing campaigns will get picked up by local (and even national) news sources, resulting in a publicity powerhouse affect that marketers drool over.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cons of Guerrilla Marketing<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mysterious messages can be misunderstood.<\/strong>\u00a0There\u2019s often an air of mystery to guerrilla marketing campaigns, and while it\u2019s this sense of mystery that can often propel a campaign\u2019s attention and notice, the lack of clarity can also skew audience interpretation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Confusion associated with guerrilla marketing campaigns can have extreme implications, such as in 2007, when flashing LED circuit boards promoting a new animated series,\u00a0<em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force<\/em>, were quietly installed around the city of Boston. The objects were mistaken for explosive devices, causing citywide panic as bomb squads were brought in to examine and remove the unknown devices.<\/p>\n<p>The hired installers were even arrested for mounting \u201choax devices,\u201d but were later released. While it\u2019d be easy to label this campaign as a disaster, the story got picked up on major media networks across the country, so despite whole ordeal, some would probably call it a success.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Authority intervention.\u00a0<\/strong>Some forms of guerrilla marketing, such as non-permissioned street graffiti, can result in tension with authorities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unpredicted obstacles.<\/strong>\u00a0Many guerrilla marketing tactics are susceptible to bad weather, thrown timing, and other small instances that could easily threaten to undermine an entire campaign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Potential backlash.<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0Savvy audiences may call out businesses who are implementing guerrilla marketing campaigns they don\u2019t approve of. This is especially true of undercover marketing campaigns \u2013 if you\u2019re caught, prepare to face the wrath.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that guerrilla marketing can provide fantastic results while allowing marketers to exercise their creativity in a unique way, but it will only work for businesses who aren\u2019t afraid of risk-taking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/28\/best-marketing-campaigns-examples\">\u00a0The 5 Best Marketing Campaigns We&#8217;ve Ever Seen (&amp; How to DIY)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Real-world examples of guerrilla marketing<\/h2>\n<h3>10.
