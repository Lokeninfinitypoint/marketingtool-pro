However, they haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time explaining to Internet marketers exactly what LSI keywords are. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">LSI stands for Latent Semantic Index(ing). This is a computer program that is designed to learn a wide variety of synonyms based on context. It\u2019s a method that uses mathematical techniques to find relationships between words and concepts within a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/28\/content-marketing-advice\">piece of content<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lsi20keywords20diagram.png\" alt=\"LSI keywords diagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"402\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/organiksoft.com\/what-are-lsi-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s a more practical definition of LSI keywords: <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In terms of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO<\/a> (search engine optimization), LSI keywords are search terms related to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/07\/21\/blog-keyword-targeting\">main keyword you are targeting<\/a>. They help to support your content and add more context to make it easier for both users and search engines to know what your content is about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Both the above and below are examples of suitable LSI keywords for this post\u2019s primary keyword, which is \u201c<em>LSI keywords<\/em>\u201d:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">What are LSI keywords<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">LSI keywords examples<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">How to use related keywords <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Tools to find LSI keywords<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Do related keywords affect SEO<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Semantic keywords<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see, each of the phrases above is suitable for accompanying the main keyword (\u201cLSI keywords\u201d). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Don\u2019t worry if this sounds a little complicated (especially since our keyword includes the word &#8220;keyword&#8221;). Later on, we\u2019ll look at the different ways to easily find LSI\/related keywords, as well as how you can use them in your content to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">appear higher<\/a> and more frequently in relevant search results. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Are LSI keywords the same as synonyms?<\/h3>\n<p>While some LSI keywords can be synonyms, not all synonyms are LSI keywords. The majority of LSI keywords are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">words and phrases<\/a> that are <em>closely related<\/em> to your main keyword.\u00a0So, using synonyms in your posts can help your article\u2019s on-page SEO, but synonyms aren\u2019t LSI keywords.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a synonym for the word \u201cjacket\u201d would be \u201ccoat\u201d. However, LSI keywords for \u201cjacket\u201d would include words like: reversible, winter, feather down, warm, padded, puffer, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>A good way to understand the difference between synonyms and related keywords is to perform a Google search. The suggested searches that appear in the drop-down menu are LSI keywords:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lsi20keywords20examples_0.png\" alt=\"lsi keywords examples\" width=\"721\" height=\"379\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>What are the benefits of using LSI keywords?<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As I mentioned in the introduction, there are hundreds of thousands of Google queries performed each year that have never been searched. Google has made improvements to its algorithm to factor in context so that it can better understand related keywords.\u00a0Google said:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/LSI20keywords20new20searches20on20Google_1.png\" alt=\"LSI keywords new searches on Google\" width=\"600\" height=\"274\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-reaffirms-15-searches-new-never-searched-273786\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Incorporating LSI keywords into your content boosts the contextuality of your content and yields <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/09\/long-term-value-of-seo-myth\">SEO benefits<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They boost your website\u2019s ranking in search engines: <\/strong>Sprinkling LSI keywords throughout your text helps search engines to understand your page and boost its ranking power.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Semantic keywords improve your content\u2019s relevance:<\/strong> Adding related words also helps to ensure you don\u2019t overload your content with keywords, aka keyword stuffing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Related words increase the number of people who find your content: <\/strong>LSI keywords also help you provide a better search experience for users, which, in turn, translates into improvements in various ranking factors, such as time spent on a page, bounce rate, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Do LSI keywords have any disadvantages?<\/h3>\n<p>LSI keywords don\u2019t necessarily have any disadvantages, but the indexing method does have some limitations. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It doesn\u2019t consider the order of words and disposes of all conjunctions and prepositions.<\/li>\n<li>It considers words to have just <em>one <\/em>meaning.<\/li>\n<li>It does not recognize underlying ideas and irony. In some cases, the meaning of the words may not match the meaning of the text.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">When did LSI keywords become relevant?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering when LSI keywords became relevant, it all began in 2004 when latent semantic indexing was implemented in Google\u2019s search algorithm. Its purpose was to assist the search engine in providing users with more relevant results.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lsi20keywords20relevant20results.png\" alt=\"lsi keywords relevant results\" width=\"800\" height=\"679\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Google can produce relevant results for even figurative language.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But, Google wasn\u2019t just focused on keywords. The search giant also wanted to understand anchor text in hyperlinks, as well as groups of sites that link to each other (also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/seo-street-smarts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO neighborhoods<\/a>). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">With all this in one algorithm update, Google dramatically changed the way it delivers search results. <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">No longer was the search engine targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/exact-match\">exact-match keywords<\/a> in web content. Now the algorithm could understand <em>context <\/em>and <em>synonyms<\/em>. <span lang=\"EN\">Instead of looking at a single keyword and its frequency of use to find out what the page was about, Google could now analyze <em>everything <\/em>offered on the page.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lsi20keywords20related20keywords.png\" alt=\"lsi keywords related keywords\" width=\"800\" height=\"539\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seocompetitors.com\/latent-semantic-indexing\/\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To better understand the impact of this change, let\u2019s take a deeper dive into LSI keywords and their relationship to SEO. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The Impact of LSI keywords on SEO<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In the early days, Google\u2019s crawlers, also known as \u201cspiders\u201d, would automatically find and scan websites by crawling from one link to another on connected web pages. As they crawled, they would look at the keywords on a page to help them identify its topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, if you were to publish a post titled \u201c21 Tips For Effective Email List Segmentation,\u201d Google would scan your page to determine if you used the term \u201c<em>email list segmentation<\/em>\u201d in key areas on your website, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The title tag,<\/li>\n<li>Content body,<\/li>\n<li>Image alt text,<\/li>\n<li>H1 heading, H2 and H3 subheaders, and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But, after the LSI update, Google\u2019s crawling method changed, resulting in these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">SEO improvements<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google understands pages better<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to scanning your page for the main keyword, now it would also scan your page for various <em>related<\/em> keywords, such as: \u201cemail campaign,\u201d \u201cMailChimp,\u201d \u201caudience,\u201d \u201csubscribers,\u201d \u201cemail tools,\u201d and so on.\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">What this means is, Google works to find out what the <em>overall <\/em>topic of a page is, and relies on latent semantic indexing to understand the content at a much deeper level than simply looking for multiple occurrences of a specific keyword.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google reads pages contextually<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Basically, Google\u2019s algorithm now has the ability to \u201cread\u201d a page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/intl\/en-gb\/advertising-channels\/search\/search-getting-smarter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the same way a human would<\/a>, and categorize keywords depending on the determined context.\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">This means that the search engine can now differentiate between words based on even the <em>smallest <\/em>details (which is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/18\/content-optimization\">keyword mapping<\/a> is important). For instance, it can now tell the difference between literal and figurative expressions, like:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0<em>\u201cDon\u2019t shoehorn LSI keywords into your content if they are not relevant.\u201d <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">vs<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cUse a shoehorn to protect shoes when you put them on.\u201d<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google can generate even more relevant results<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to this recent <a href=\"https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45569\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research paper from Google<\/a>, they identify words that frequently occur together to help the bots more easily understand the main topic of the pages it scans.

That is an amazing standard of quality which would be impossible for the search engine to achieve without latent semantic indexing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Does YouTube use LSI keywords?<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Interestingly, it should be noted that even though Google owns <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/20\/youtube-marketing\">YouTube<\/a>, they primarily run on two different search engines and algorithms. What I\u2019ve found surprising is that it doesn\u2019t seem that, at the time of this writing, YouTube utilizes LSI keywords for rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As a YouTube creator myself, I try to include primary keywords in the titles of my videos and rarely pay attention to LSI keywords, and the videos still rank well. The only place I\u2019d be able to put them is in the description of the video, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s required.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So while YouTube searches do pull up related suggestions, there aren\u2019t many places to insert LSI keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube20LSI20keywords.png\" alt=\"youtube LSI keywords\" width=\"625\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Related\/LSI keywords on YouTube, from our <\/span><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/14\/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube\"><em>How to Get More Views on YouTube <\/em><\/a><em>blog post.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">YouTube SEO relies mainly on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-youtube-editing-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-quality editing<\/a> to increase engagement and the click-through rate of the thumbnails. Of course, I\u2019m over-simplifying a complex algorithm, but it\u2019s a universally accepted truth that high-quality editing, rather than LSI keywords, is the biggest factor in YouTube\u2019s algorithm.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So although LSI keywords seem to be an important factor on the Google search engine, they are not as important in the YouTube search engine.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p>With that, let\u2019s move on to the next section where you\u2019ll discover 5 effective tools to help you find LSI keywords to use in your posts.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">How to find related keywords with LSI keyword tools<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first step in finding LSI keywords is to create a base of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">important keywords for your business<\/a>.

For instance, if you were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing a blog post<\/a> targeting the main keyword \u201cblog SEO\u201d, the tool you\u2019re using might spit out an endless list of options, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog seo checklist<\/li>\n<li>Seo blog topics<\/li>\n<li>blog post seo tips<\/li>\n<li>Seo blogs for beginners<\/li>\n<li>what are the advantages of seo<\/li>\n<li>Seo blog meaning<\/li>\n<li>Seo plugins for bloggers<\/li>\n<li>How to write seo friendly post<\/li>\n<li>blog seo for beginners<\/li>\n<li>Seo latest trends<\/li>\n<li>how to optimize your post for seo<\/li>\n<li>&#8230;and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, most of these are good (depending on the context).<\/p>\n<p>If you were creating a blog post for WordStream on the benefits of blogging SEO, you would pair the main keyword, \u201cblog SEO\u201d with relevant phrases like \u201c<em>what are the advantages of SEO<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>blog SEO for beginners<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the post was about the different ways to optimize your blogging SEO, you would choose LSI phrases like \u201c<em>how to optimize your post for SEO<\/em>\u201d and \u201c<em>X blog post SEO tips<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Look at the total monthly search estimate<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, determining the best LSI keywords for your phrases can be really difficult, as some suggestions may make sense as a completely different post altogether.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you were writing a post about \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-online-course-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>online course platforms<\/em><\/a>\u201d you\u2019d see LSI keyword suggestions like \u201c<em>online course learning platforms.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When this happens, you need to determine if the suggestion would make better sense as an individual article, or as an addition to the original post. For me, I usually look at the total monthly search estimate to decide whether it\u2019s worth it to write something new, or include the suggestion as a part of the original article I\u2019m researching.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/LSI20keywords20search20volume.png\" alt=\"LSI keywords monthly search volume\" width=\"800\" height=\"765\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The keywords that your tool offers will work for different contexts, and you need to determine which ones will work best for the specific page you\u2019re creating.<\/p>\n<p>During your research, if you come across keywords that don\u2019t fit your page, you can still make a note of them to use on different pages so you can improve the overall SEO of your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Add LSI keywords to your page<\/h3>\n<p>You should add your LSI keywords to the same places you would add your main keyword, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meta title and meta description<\/li>\n<li>Headings (H1, H2, H3)<\/li>\n<li>Image alt tags<\/li>\n<li>Throughout the body text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make sure you sprinkle related words and phrases throughout your post in a natural-sounding way. This will help broaden your opportunities since you can\u2019t use the main keyword over and over again in all the important areas of your page.<\/p>\n<h3>Focus on user experience<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t overuse LSI keywords in your content. While these aren\u2019t your keywords, exactly, it\u2019s still quite easy to overuse them\u2014and if you do, you will get penalized for it.\u00a0You want to include enough related words to make the context of your page immediately clear to Google and other search engines, but without ruining the reader\u2019s experience.<\/p>\n<p>To do this effectively, you must add related keywords while keeping the content cohesive, natural-sounding, and easy to follow. This will help you not only\u00a0avoid penalties but also to improve your visitors&#8217; experience and ultimately,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/how-to-make-money-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make money while blogging<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Final tips for using LSI keywords for SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some general rules for implementing related words in your content to enhance your SEO strategy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t go overboard with the use of synonyms<\/li>\n<li>Write how you <em>speak<\/em>. If you wouldn\u2019t say it in real life, it doesn\u2019t belong in the text<\/li>\n<li>Use a fixed ratio of related words and phrases to the rest of your content (eg. one LSI keyword for every 200-300 words)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although having a ratio such as the one above isn\u2019t perfect\u2014and it certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will rank for any of your chosen LSI keywords\u2013it is a helpful guideline to get you going in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how often you use LSI keywords, your main priority should always be to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">clear, concise, and useful information<\/a> that helps readers find the answers and solutions they seek (while also helping you achieve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">business objective<\/a> of transforming readers into paying customers, of course).<\/p>\n<p>If you write with the aim of providing value first, you\u2019ll find that you wind up using related keywords in a natural way throughout your text without making any conscious effort.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Incorporate LSI keywords into your content and SEO strategy<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Google has made great strides in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
