Facebook used to be a place for folks to upload their photos into albums to keep them organized and share what they\u2019d been up to, but with the increase in popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels, users are now so much more accustomed to scrolling through endless videos designed to make them laugh, cry, or stay informed. With this change in user behavior, it\u2019s now more important than ever to be sure you\u2019re creating engaging content that cuts through the noise and stands out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ad example\" width=\"377\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78403 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-example.jpg 377w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-example-189x300.jpg 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of a Facebook video ad.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span>Video ads on the Meta Business platform (which reaches Facebook and Instagram) is a great way to do this. Although the ability to churn out video ads regularly was reserved for brands with big budgets in years past, new tools and AI have helped democratize this and now any brand can advertise using high-quality videos without spending much at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this post, I want to talk through some best practices for Facebook video ads and show you some tools you can use to execute those strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#facebook-video-ad-best-practices\">Facebook video ads best practices<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#facebook-video-ad-tools\">Facebook video ad tools<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-use-facebook-video-ads\">Getting started with Facebook video ads<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"facebook-video-ad-best-practices\"><\/div>\n<h2><span>Facebook video ads best practices<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Follow these<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/28\/facebook-video-marketing\"> Facebook video ad tips<\/a> to squeeze the most out of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/28\/facebook-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ad costs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Create videos in all aspect ratios<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>If you\u2019ve used Meta Ads recently, you probably know there are tons of different placements your ads can show up on the network. The good news is that to cover this vast list of placements, you only need to come up with three distinct aspect ratios for your video ads:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-ratios.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads ratio chart\" width=\"860\" height=\"257\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78393 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-ratios.jpg 860w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-ratios-480x143.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 860px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Having videos in each of these aspect ratios ensures you\u2019re eligible to show in all the placements you\u2019d like to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We\u2019ll talk later about how you can make these aspect ratios if you don\u2019t have a dedicated creative team, but in the ad creation process, you\u2019re able to select different video files to fit into each aspect ratio. Facebook will then automatically serve the creative with the right sizing for each spot to ensure you have the best-looking ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ad sizing and resizing screenshot\" width=\"765\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78387 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature.jpg 765w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature-480x376.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 765px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Now, while it might not seem like a huge deal to have all three ratios, I think it\u2019s actually one of the easiest things you can do to help make sure your ads look good and stand out. In the image above, you can easily see how different an ad will look in the vertical and horizontal placements if you only have a square image. They\u2019re not bad, necessarily, but they certainly don\u2019t have the high-quality, professional look that most users have become accustomed to in recent years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Want to know how your Facebook ads are <em>really<\/em> performing?

Be prepared for all sound options\u00a0 <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/10\/instagram-vs-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Facebook or Instagram<\/a> user, you\u2019ve likely visited the platforms in all sorts of scenarios. With full sound while sitting on your couch or in your bed. Maybe you have your headphones in while out in public, or maybe you\u2019re even one of those crazy people with their sound up on the subway. But odds are, there have been at least a few instances where you were on those platforms and didn\u2019t have the sound on at all.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For each of these instances, you were bound to see ads and the level of volume you were using likely had an impact on how sticky those ads were for you. Designing your ads to be digestible regardless of a user\u2019s sound level is highly important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Here are a few questions to ask yourself while crafting Facebook video ads sounds:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Do you have an engaging\/entertaining voiceover? <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Is there music you can choose to fit the mood of the ad? <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Do you have subtitles for the voiceover in case someone\u2019s sound is off? <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Is the voiceover clear and easily understandable even in a loud environment?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span>3. Get your main message across in the first 3 seconds<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>No matter what the original purpose was for someone to visit social media, the main point is that they\u2019re not there to view your ads. I feel very confident in saying that for the majority of people visiting Facebook or Instagram, they\u2019re not there to see what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">product or service you\u2019re selling<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ads on YouTube<\/a>, users are pretty easily able to skip and scroll past the ads on Facebook and Instagram. That is, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_4OO9q1oYfU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unless you run non-skippable ads<\/a>, but those are pretty rare. So, you need to make sure you\u2019re making a big impact in the first few seconds of your ads\u2026before the remainder of it is skipped. If you do a good job of creating a compelling hook in that short time, you can certainly draw their attention for longer, maybe up to 15-30 seconds, some even longer. But odds are, your views will be short so you need to be front-heavy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this time, it\u2019s important to get your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business name<\/a> and core<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brand messaging<\/a> across so that even if a user does scroll past you, you\u2019ve at least made that much of an impact. They\u2019ll have a higher chance at brand recall later if they\u2019ve heard your name in that brief intro. This can include text, voiceover,<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> business logos<\/a>, and more, so be creative, engaging, and entertaining. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Blend into the platform aesthetic<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>In my experience, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/best-facebook-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best ads on Facebook<\/a> or Instagram (I\u2019m typically an Instagram user) are ones that blend into the platform aesthetic. The ads that typically entice me the most are the ones I don\u2019t really know are ads until I look down to see the Sponsored messaging down at the bottom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The best way to discover this is to become a user of the platform itself. For Instagram, go to the Explore tab and type in some of your key terms, maybe the same ones you use for search or maybe some terms that mirror the interest or behavior targeting you\u2019re using for your campaigns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>See what the grid looks like. What shows u<\/span><span>p? What brands are there? How are they marketing to people? While you may not want to become just part of the noise, blending in allows you to make a greater impact and feel more natural to the audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-grid.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - example of instagram explore grid\" width=\"296\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78390 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-grid.jpg 296w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-grid-148x300.jpg 148w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - instagram grid example\" width=\"297\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78391 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid.jpg 297w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid-149x300.jpg 149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>For example, I have a renewed interest in landscape photography and am in the market for a new camera.

Retarget users who engage with your videos<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>I might be biased, but one of the biggest mistakes I think advertisers make is not<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/retargeting-ad-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> retargeting people<\/a> who watch their Facebook videos. Sure, they might find their way to seeing you again through prospecting or they may remember you enough to come back to your site, but why would you target people (who you seemingly thought were valuable) once, then not work to target them again? Especially after they are already aware of you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>On the Facebook ads platform, you can make audiences of users who have engaged with your videos in many different ways. Just head to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Facebook ads audience manager<\/a> and choose Video as your source for an audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audiences.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - video audience source screenshot \" width=\"721\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78389 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audiences.jpg 721w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audiences-480x399.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>From there, you can choose how they have interacted with those videos. Did they watch the whole thing? A certain percentage of it? Think about where your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">value propositions<\/a> and messaging hits in those videos and be sure to include that in your audience filters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - video engagement audience\" width=\"901\" height=\"505\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78392 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience.jpg 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience-480x269.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Next, you can choose the videos you want to retarget people from. Yes, you can select only certain videos if you think they\u2019re more impactful, part of a separate campaign, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - audience engagement options\" width=\"900\" height=\"207\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78388 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched-480x110.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Lastly, you can choose how long you want to reengage with someone who watched those videos for that amount of time. One error I see is always setting the time frame to the longest possible setting. Now be honest\u2026if you saw a video ad once 180 days ago, do you think you\u2019re still a hot prospect for that brand? Probably not. Make sure you keep that in mind when making these audiences. Higher engagers can likely stick around longer, but lower engagers probably should be let free from your retargeting grasp a bit sooner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audience-retention.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - audience retention length\" width=\"508\" height=\"196\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78386 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audience-retention.jpg 508w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-audience-retention-480x185.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 508px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-video-ad-tools\"><\/div>\n<h2><span>Helpful Facebook video ad tools<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>Now that we have some best practices out of the way, I want to talk about how to make the Facebook video ad creatives. Not every Facebook video ad has to be done by a hugely expensive creative shop. Some can be done just as well with your own means, and sometimes for free! Here are some of the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/24\/design-facebook-ads-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook video ad creative resources<\/a> your business can take advantage of:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>Yes, phone cameras are acceptable<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>A big expensive camera only makes world-changing videos when there\u2019s an amazing photographer or videographer behind the lens. For most people, a camera phone will do just fine. In many cases, they\u2019ll do better than if you tried to use an expensive camera due to all the ways the tech companies are making them easier to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ads - apple ios facebook video compatibility \" width=\"718\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78383 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications.jpg 718w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications-480x249.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Next time you need to put together a video, take a shot with your phone first. Many times, those videos will turn out great, and will help fit you into the platform aesthetic naturally as much of the content on Facebook and Instagram is also shot on a phone.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>Facebook\u2019s cropping tool<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Once you have a video, there are options in Facebook ads to adjust your creatives for different sizes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio.jpg\" alt=\"facebook video ad - cropping in facebook video ads using facebook's cropping tool\" width=\"713\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78385 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio.jpg 713w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio-480x378.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>In the image above, you can see we have a square video that needs cropped to vertical.
