Here are five of my favorite tools for analyzing your Google Ads competition.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Auction Insights<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/14\/adwords-auction-insights\">Auction Insights report<\/a> allows you to look at who else is bidding on your keywords. You can see impression shares, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/14\/goodbye-average-position\">average position<\/a>, overlap rate, position above rate, and top of page rate that each competitor has on a particular keyword. With this information, you can effectively better manage your own bids in comparison to whomever you deem your highest competition. \u00a0The below graphic shows which competitors are bidding on the keyword \u201cfoam mattress.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competition-auction-insights-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition auction insights\" width=\"1622\" height=\"367\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>2. Google Ads Grader<\/h2>\n<p>What list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/10\/free-google-ads-tools\">Google Ads tools<\/a> would be complete without our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>? This free tool performs an instant audit of your account and generates a report card on how you compare to industry benchmarks and best practices. You&#8217;ll get insights into your:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wasted spend<\/li>\n<li>Quality Score<\/li>\n<li>Impression share<\/li>\n<li>Account activity<\/li>\n<li>Click-through rate<\/li>\n<li>Best and worst text ad<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/google-ads-grader-score-report-laptop-dark-compressed.png\" alt=\"google ads grader account audit report on a laptop\" width=\"449\" height=\"338\" class=\"wp-image-65235 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Try the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Grader<\/a><\/strong> today and see how you score.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Keyword Planner<\/h2>\n<p>Typically, when people use the Google Ads\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/keyword-planner-updates\">Keyword Planner<\/a>, they think of using it to find <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/06\/keyword-research-tips\">keyword ideas<\/a> from their own site and landing pages. Conversely, try plugging a few of your competitors URL\u2019s into the search bar. The results may display keyword ideas you never thought of using. Because these keyword ideas came from the competitor\u2019s site, they are likely already being utilized by your competitors.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competition-keyword-planner-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition Keyword Planner\" width=\"558\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are also many tools that you can pay for if your budget allows for a little wiggle room. Here I\u2019ll highlight one that I frequently use:<\/p>\n<h2>4. SEMrush<\/h2>\n<p>One great, affordable tool for paid search marketers to utilize is SEMrush.com. This is a platform that we utilize here at WordStream to help our clients gain a competitive edge in their Google Ads\u00a0accounts. We are able to pull reasonably accurate data regarding <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">what keywords a client\u2019s competitors are bidding on<\/a>, how much they are spending, and a sample of what their ads look like.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we have a pet supplies business, and we\u2019d like to see which competitors are bidding on the keyword <em>pet supplies<\/em>. Simply, all I must do is type \u201cpet supplies\u201d into the search tab and <em>voila<\/em>! The top 15 sites bidding on this particular keyword are:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competition-guide-semrush-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition SEMrush\" width=\"176\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Another cool way to use SEMrush is to enter the URL of one of your competitors. Going back to the pet supplies business example, we can easily see how much PetSmart spends on their paid search initiative, how much traffic they see, which keywords they are bidding on, and what a sample of their ad text looks like.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competition-analysis-data-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition analysis data\" width=\"141\" height=\"211\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competitive-analysis-keyword-research-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition top keywords\" width=\"547\" height=\"321\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-adwords-competitors-ad-text-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition PetSmart ad\" width=\"461\" height=\"102\" \/><\/div>\n<div><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">How to Do Competitor Keyword Analysis in 5 Steps (+Free Template!)<\/a><\/div>\n<h2>Competitive Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Once your Google Ads\u00a0account is well structured, you can think about optimizing it further with direct <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/16\/competitive-advertising\">competitive advertising<\/a>. How can you do this? I\u2019ll use possibly the most competitive rivalry in the world as my high-level example. Let\u2019s say we are Coca-Cola. We might consider bidding on the keyword <em>Pepsi<\/em>. We can gain more brand awareness and potentially convert a Pepsi drinker into a Coke drinker.<\/p>\n<p>In this next screenshot, we can see an example of a competitive campaign that was executed effectively.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-competitive-campaign-example-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords competition campaign example\" width=\"1489\" height=\"108\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Best practice is to not utilize attack tactics. Coca-Cola would not want to launch an ad that directly puts down Pepsi. This could potentially cheapen the Coca-Cola brand. Also remember that businesses must keep in accordance with Google policies, meaning that in Coke\u2019s competitive ad, they could not use the trademarked term <em>Pepsi<\/em> in their ad text.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-adwords-campaigns-1.jpg\" alt=\"AdWords competition Mac versus PC\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Another point is that Quality Score is going to be lower for competitive campaigns, and it is unlikely that your competitive campaign\u2019s ads will show up in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/01\/adwords-myths\">the first position<\/a>. After all, Google\u2019s main focus is to make sure the searcher finds what they are looking for. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no solid data to prove that a higher position translates into a higher ROI.<\/p>\n<p>As a side note, beware that when a business launches a competitive campaign on another brand, it is only a matter of time until the competitor is likely to launch their own competitive campaigns in return.<\/p>\n<h2>Worth It?<\/h2>\n<p>My overall conclusion is that competitive campaigns are effective and worthwhile if your budget allows for it (if not, use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-compete-in-google-ads\">tips to compete in Google Ads without raising bids<\/a>). Obviously, it is most important to make sure all the bases are covered around all branded and non-branded terms. If after these campaigns are launched and optimized and there is still leftover paid search budget, then a competitive campaign might be the right direction to steer.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb0 Speaking of budgets&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Free download <\/strong>&gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLDigestibleAdBudgets.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_GoogleAdsBudgetsGuide_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The Easy Guide to Google Ads Budgets<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p>If budget is tight and there is no extra money to fund a competitive PPC campaign, it is not the end of the world. However, it is important to at least make sure you are bidding on the same top non-branded keywords as the competition. You can use the tactics mentioned in this article to help you determine which keywords these are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you competitive in Google Ads?
