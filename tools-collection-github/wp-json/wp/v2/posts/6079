When done right, mobile marketing provides customers or potential customers using smartphones with personalized, time- and location-sensitive information so that they can get what they need exactly when they need it, even if they&#8217;re on the go.<\/p>\n<p>I would tell you that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/06\/mobile-first-indexing\">mobile<\/a> is the future of marketing, but really <strong>the era of mobile has already arrived<\/strong>. If you&#8217;re not implementing some kind of mobile marketing strategy, you&#8217;re already trailing behind!<\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the graph below, more users are spending larger amounts of time engaged with mobile devices than ever before.

Mobile marketing ad formats, customization, and styles can vary, as many social media platforms, websites, and mobile apps offer their own unique and tailored mobile ad options.<\/p>\n<h2>Why You Need a Mobile Marketing Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Your business needs a mobile marketing strategy for the same reason that you need a computer and wi-fi access \u2013 this is the age in which we live! Walk around any major city and you\u2019ll find more than just a few folks with faces glued to their smartphone screens. According to recent reports, <a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/report-nearly-40-percent-of-internet-time-now-on-mobile-devices-34639\">40% of users\u2019 internet time<\/a> is spent on mobile devices, which means simply ignoring the rise of mobile just isn\u2019t an option.<\/p>\n<p>Some other interesting <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/mobile\/what-is-mobile-marketing\">mobile marketing<\/a> statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingwiz.co\/marketers-guide-to-how-people-spend-time-on-mobile-devices\/\">80% of mobile device time<\/a> in spent on apps, with game apps eating up the largest percent of app time<\/li>\n<li>People browse <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingwiz.co\/marketers-guide-to-how-people-spend-time-on-mobile-devices\/\">70% more web pages on tablets<\/a> than smartphones<\/li>\n<li>Retail conversion rates are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingwiz.co\/marketers-guide-to-how-people-spend-time-on-mobile-devices\/\">2.2% on tablets<\/a>, considerably higher than 0.7% on smartphones, but traditional PC conversion rates are still highest at 3.3%<\/li>\n<li>Mobile searches have increased <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/06\/google-for-mobile\">200% year over year<\/a> in 2012<\/li>\n<li>Mobile is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mobile-will-eclipse-desktop-by-2014-2012-6\">predicted to surpass desktop<\/a> in 2014<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Mobile is here to stay, and if forecasts are correct, it will soon by eclipsing desktop usage. If you don\u2019t have a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/03\/local-mobile-marketing-strategy\">mobile marketing strategy<\/a> yet, it\u2019s time to get going!<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Mobile Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a healthy variety of mobile marketing strategies to try. The kind that works best for your business will depend on your industry, target audience, and budget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>App-based marketing:<\/strong> This is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/06\/facebook-ads-for-mobile-apps\">mobile advertising involving mobile apps<\/a>. While 80% of mobile time is spent engaged with apps, you don\u2019t have to create an app yourself to get in on the action. Services like <a href=\"\/admob\">Google AdMob<\/a> help advertisers create mobile ads that appear within third-party mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also allows advertisers to create ads that are integrated into Facebook\u2019s mobile app. Facebook\u2019s mobile <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/15\/facebook-marketing\">Promoted Post ads<\/a> integrate so seamlessly with Facebook\u2019s news feed that users often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re looking at ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In-game mobile marketing:<\/strong> In-game mobile marketing refers to mobile ads that appear within mobile games, like in the example below. In-game ads can appear as banner pop-ups, full-page image ads or even <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/27\/youtube-advertising\">video ads<\/a> that appear between loading screens.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/in-game-mobile-marketing-1.png\" alt=\"in game mobile marketing\" width=\"291\" height=\"148\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Example of an in-game mobile marketing ad<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>QR codes:<\/strong> QR codes are scanned by users, who are then taken to a specific webpage that the QR code is attached to. QR codes are often aligned with mobile gamification and have an element of mystery to them, since users who scan them don\u2019t always know exactly which rabbit hole they\u2019re jumping down.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Location-based marketing:<\/strong> Location-based mobile ads are ads that appear on mobile devices based upon a user\u2019s location relative to a specific area or business. For example, some advertisers may only want their mobile ads to appear when users are within a 1-mile radius of their business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile search ads:<\/strong> These are basic Google search ads built for mobile, often featuring extra add-on extensions like click-to-call or maps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile image ads:<\/strong> Image-based ads designed to appear on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SMS:<\/strong> SMS marketing involves capturing a user\u2019s phone number and sending them text offers. This is considered somewhat pass\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to dig in and optimize your mobile marketing campaigns, check out our list of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/14\/mobile-marketing-tools\">13 mobile marketing tools you need<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Mobile Marketing: Google Ads\u00a0Enhanced Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>On July 12, Google rolled out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/10\/enhanced-campaigns-faq\">Enhanced Campaigns<\/a> for all Google Ads\u00a0users, integrating mobile advertising options with classic online Google Ads advertising (formerly known as Google AdWords).<\/p>\n<p>Enhanced Campaigns allow advertisers to manage their Google Ads\u00a0bids across various devices in one single campaign, rather than make separate campaigns for mobile vs. desktop. Google\u00a0advertisers can simply take the Google search ads they already use, and then set bids to adjust for mobile devices. To increase bids for mobile devices, users can set a positive bid adjustment, such as +20%, and vice versa \u2013 a bid adjustment of -10% reduces the bid by 10% for mobile devices.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mobile-bid-adjustments-1.png\" alt=\"mobile bid adjustments\" width=\"1054\" height=\"429\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Enhanced Campaigns image via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siteproppc.com\/adwords-management\/adwords-enhanced-campaigns-understanding-mobile-bid-adjustments\/\">siteproppc.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s in Google\u2019s best interest to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/13\/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks\">make mobile marketing easy for advertisers<\/a> \u2013 Google generates a hefty amount of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/06\/google-for-mobile\">revenue from mobile ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s Enhanced Campaigns allow for advertisers to manage bids across devices, locations, and time with ease. Some advertisers may choose to bid higher for users on mobile devices who are within a certain range of their store, or may only want to bid on mobile devices during their store\u2019s open hours, and Enhanced Campaigns make that an easy possibility for advertisers.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Mobile Ad Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>Creating mobile search ads with Google also lets you take advantage of Google\u2019s nifty mobile ad extensions, which include features like:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile<\/strong> <strong>Site Links: <\/strong>Mobile site links make it easy for mobile users to jump to specific pages of your site without wandering around.

Cluttered and crowded ads will just drive users to scroll past. When it comes to mobile, it\u2019s best to keep things simple.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize for Local: <\/strong>Be sure to remember that 1 in 3 mobile searches have local intent. Users often use mobile devices to complement their immediate worldly interactions \u2013 where is the nearest gas station? Is there a nearby coffee shop that has wi-fi? Optimize for local mobile marketing to make sure you are aligning with users\u2019 queries.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consider Your Audience: <\/strong>The type of audience you\u2019re hoping to reach should influence the kind of mobile ads you use. Are they gamers? Then try taking advantage of in-game ads. Are they young and tech-savvy? Mobile Facebook Promoted Posts might be more likely to get their attention.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Experiment with Different Strategies: <\/strong>There\u2019s a lot of room for experimentation when it comes to mobile marketing. Don\u2019t be afraid to test out some ad extensions with your Google Ads\u00a0Enhanced Campaigns \u2013 try the Google Offers ad extension, or the click-to-call extension, and see how they work for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Benchmark Your Results: <\/strong>Experimenting is great, but there\u2019s no point in trying new techniques if you\u2019re not tracking your results to see what works and what doesn\u2019t. <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">Try the AdWords Grader<\/a> to see how your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/18\/mobile-ppc-ads\">mobile PPC ads<\/a> are performing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Sitelinks photo and local ad extension photo via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/generating-mobile-traffic-or-how-to-get-your-mobile-site-found-20762\"><em>Marketing Land<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is mobile marketing and why is it essential for your marketing strategy?
