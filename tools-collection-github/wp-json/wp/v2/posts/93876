Here are a few tips to win over current and future customers when you <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reply to a negative review<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Set your goal: <\/strong>Before typing a response, imagine what outcome you want.

Confirm that you\u2019ve taken the feedback to heart, reiterate the concern, and offer a specific solution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Apologize: <\/strong>A swift apology is a strong foundation for your response.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offer a resolution and take it offline:<\/strong> Give a brief synopsis of how you\u2019ll make things right and offer to discuss details in DMs, by email, or on the phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4.

Set up social listening<\/h3>\n<p>The next item on our reputation management task list is to track the instances of people mentioning your brand online. And for that, we\u2019ll use a tactic called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/20\/social-listening\">social listening<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Social listening is the practice of tracking what people say about your business on social media, in forums, and through other digital outlets. Here\u2019s how to use social listening to spot those mentions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a social media management tool:<\/strong> Enter your business name and other relevant keywords into a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\"> social media management tool<\/a> like Sprout Social or Crowdfire, and they\u2019ll seek out places your brand is mentioned.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Search the platforms:<\/strong> Type your business name or relevant hashtag into the query bar of a social media app or online forum (like Quora or Reddit) to see if it\u2019s mentioned.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set up a Google Alert: <\/strong>Set up a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/04\/10\/google-alerts\"> Google Alert<\/a> for your business or product name and receive notifications when it\u2019s mentioned on the web.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When those conversations pop up, be prepared to jump in and answer questions, add context, or just have fun with your customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/reputation-management-wordstream-fun.webp\" alt=\"Reputation management - Tweet reply from KFC.\" width=\"504\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93883 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/reputation-management-wordstream-fun.webp 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/reputation-management-wordstream-fun-480x571.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/billyboxing2\/status\/1961391703673196632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6. Create a crisis triage process<\/h3>\n<p>Stay in business long enough and you\u2019re bound to have some sort of reputation crisis. It could result from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/28\/marketing-fails\">poorly timed ad<\/a> or an unfortunate customer experience. It may even be something completely out of your control, like a vindictive competitor review bombing your business on Google.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the cause, if you have an action plan in place, you\u2019ll respond more quickly and thoughtfully. Your specific crisis triage process will be unique to your business, but here are a few foundational actions to include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assess: <\/strong>Review the incident (who, what, where, when, why), including the potential impact.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assign:<\/strong> Designate a crisis response team and note who should be alerted, who needs to review, and who needs to approve actions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Respond:<\/strong> Set rules around employee communications, handling incoming messages, and creating an official response.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Monitor:<\/strong> Ramp up your social listening for a while to see how your response fared and be prepared to pivot if future action is needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Measure success<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"7\"><\/ol>\n<p>The goal is to improve your business\u2019s reputation. The best way to know if you\u2019re succeeding is to set some benchmarks and measure the change over time.

Businesses caught in the act are dropped from the popular site, losing out on a lot of future business.<\/p>\n<h4>Offering an insincere apology<\/h4>\n<p>Mistakes happen. And when they do, you have an opportunity to turn the mishap into a learning and building opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, one thing that will end any hope at redemption\u2014and crush your reputation\u2014is a cold, impersonal apology.<\/p>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/01\/21\/business\/kyte-baby-ceo-apology-marissa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kyte Baby kerfuffle<\/a>.
