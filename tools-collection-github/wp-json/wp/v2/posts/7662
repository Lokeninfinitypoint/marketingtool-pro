Set up trigger emails to prevent missed opportunities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/28\/trigger-emails\">triggered email<\/a> is one that is sent out automatically after a customer takes a certain action.

But for big-ticket purchases\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/02\/b2b-marketing-strategies\">B2B marketing,<\/a> the decision involves more research and careful thinking. With nurture emails, you send a series of emails that build trust and provide\u00a0offers that gradually increase.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-tips-content-funnel-1.png\" alt=\"content marketing funnel used to send the right offers in your email marketing\" width=\"720\" height=\"402\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-a-content-marketing-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For example, your series might look like this:<\/p>\n<p>A person subscribes to your list and gets a welcome email.

Use emotion to connect<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Every pain point\u00a0and desire for customers traces back to an emotion.

Showcase your values<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Today\u2019s customers expect much more from a company than they did years before. They want to give their dollars to companies that they support, whose missions align with their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a>, and who look at them as more than just a means of revenue generation. They also covet more vulnerability and transparency.<\/p>\n<p>You can showcase your values in different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly call\u00a0them out: For example, <em>&#8220;At Flockjay, no one will fly solo. This is one of our core values and that includes you. With our new service center, you&#8217;ll have human help at your fingertips 24\/7&#8230;&#8221; <\/em><\/li>\n<li>Share milestones in your social responsibility\u00a0initiatives, like how many trees your product saved this year or how much of your proceeds were donated to an organization you support.<\/li>\n<li>Close off with an inspiring quote in each send that speaks to your values.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>10. Tell a story<\/h3>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s three sentences or three hundred pages, stories are memorable and compelling.\u00a0Here are some ways to use storytelling to improve your email marketing results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell a short\u00a0story behind your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">newest product or service<\/a> and how it came to be. Readers will be interested to see the end result, and they&#8217;ll also be reminded of why your offerings are top-quality.<\/li>\n<li>Share a brief version of a success story, and then link to the full story for more details.<\/li>\n<li>Even better, you could start with describing the customer&#8217;s problem in a way that resonates with your customers (think <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">P-A-S formula<\/a>), end\u00a0with impressive (quantifiable) results, then finish off with &#8220;How did we do it?&#8221; and a &#8220;Find out here&#8221; CTA.<\/li>\n<li>Get creative and tell your own story as a primer for the rest of the email. Sleeknote provides a great example of this email marketing tactic (although we&#8217;d recommend removing all of the line breaks for better <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/04\/seo-content-readability\">readability<\/a>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketiing-tips-storytelling-email-sleeknote-1.jpeg\" alt=\"example of storytelling email by sleeknote\" width=\"720\" height=\"722\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/story-based-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For more tips like these, check out our post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/08\/write-emails-like-a-human\">how to write emails like a human being<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">11.

With this strategy, the\u00a0content of your email automatically changes to match based on reader criteria such as gender,\u00a0geographic location, purchasing patterns, or behavior on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Customers will receive the same template but see different images, offers, and calls to action.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-tips-dynamic-email-content-example-1.png\" alt=\"illustration showing how dynamic email content works\" width=\"720\" height=\"247\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another example of dynamic content is including a countdown in your email or a live feed from your blog or social channels.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">13.

In the midst of animated graphics, sophisticated designs, and\u00a0trendy aesthetics, there is a growing appreciation among consumers for more minimalistic content.
