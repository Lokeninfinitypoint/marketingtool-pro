Depending on the volume of traffic that you have coming through your campaign, this could be a task that you do once a month, every other week, once a week, or maybe even a couple different days a week.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to review your search terms is to look at them in the report in the Google Ads interface. You may find some new keywords and new negative terms there as well. However, doing any analysis beyond the basic reviews within that report is a little tough, and usually requires the implementation of a Google Ads script. In this article, I want to walk you through one of my favorite ways to review search query performance for long-term analysis: n-grams.<\/p>\n<p>N-grams are a type of analysis you can have Google Ads output for you via a script. If you&#8217;ve never used Google Ads scripts before, don&#8217;t worry! We&#8217;re going step-by-step using a free copy-and-paste script.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-scripts\">What are Google Ads scripts?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#n-grams\">What are n-grams?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-conduct-n-gram-analysis\">How to conduct n-grams using a Google Ads script<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#n-gram-analysis-in-google-ads\">What should n-gram analyses look like?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#n-gram-google-ads-script-tips\">N-gram script tips<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-ads-scripts\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are Google Ads scripts?<\/h2>\n<p>Since an n-gram is a type of search term report analysis beyond what&#8217;s available in the Google Ads interface (more on this next), it requires a script. Before we get into the n-gram analysis for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search terms reports<\/a>, let&#8217;s first take a step back to review the concept of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-scripts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads scripts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads scripts are custom bits of code you can input into the platform to conduct specific functions beyond the norm. For example, a common use case for Google Ads scripts is automatically pausing underperforming assets. In this instance, you could input a script that tells Google Ads to automatically pause ads or keywords that don&#8217;t hit a certain metric threshold. For larger accounts, scripts can be a game changer since they save you from having to take the time to manually execute repetitive tasks. In our case today, Google Ads scripts can also come in handy for more in-depth reports, like the n-gram analysis.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a coding wizard (or have any coding experience at all, for that matter) to take advantage of Google Ads scripts. Google Ads provides a few script templates within the platform. Additionally, there are plenty of free, copy-and-paste scripts you can find online (which is where our n-gram script is from today). Another idea is that you could even use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI tool<\/a> to draft scripts to try for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-templates.jpg\" alt=\"google ads script template examples\" width=\"768\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85938 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-templates.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-templates-480x354.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 768px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8<strong> Could your Google Ads account benefit from using more scripts?<\/strong> Find out, and get more ideas to optimize, using our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"n-grams\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are n-grams?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with a definition. N-grams refer to an analysis that is done based on the individual word within a certain search query. Rather than looking at the entire query on its own, an n-gram allows you to break the query down by the individual words and understand how those words are performing in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a super easy example. In this account below, we\u2019re trying to sell worker\u2019s compensation insurance policies to local businesses. There are quite a few different ways folks will search to find this type of insurance. A few of the search queries are listed above. Each of these can be a highly valuable term for us, but with n-grams, we can better understand how each term performs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-search-terms-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads n-gram script - search terms report screenshot\" width=\"838\" height=\"470\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85934 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-search-terms-report.webp 838w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-search-terms-report-480x269.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 838px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here we have the data broken down by each term in the report.

Well, at least it doesn\u2019t for you and me. While you have to use a Google Ads script, you don&#8217;t have to come up with the code for it on your own. Luckily, one of my friends has already created the script that runs the n-gram, so he\u2019s the only one who needed a lot of technical skills so you and I can do the analysis. Thanks, Nils!<\/p>\n<p>There are a couple of things we\u2019ll need to set up before the script can run in your account.

Go to your <strong>Google Drive<\/strong> homepage, <strong>create a new spreadsheet<\/strong>, and <strong>copy the URL<\/strong> for your new spreadsheet from the URL bar.<\/p>\n<p>Then head back into the script manager and scroll down to the point where you see the <strong>spreadsheet URL here<\/strong> prompt and<strong> paste in the URL<\/strong> of the sheet you just created.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-spreadsheet-url.webp\" alt=\"google ads script - spreadsheet prompt\" width=\"900\" height=\"111\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85925 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-spreadsheet-url.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-spreadsheet-url-480x59.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we need to choose the settings for our analysis. First, you\u2019ll need to <strong>choose a date range<\/strong> that you want to look back at the search queries for. In my experience, an n-gram analysis is done over a longer period of time, likely a month, a quarter, six months, or a year depending on the volume you\u2019ve had through your account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-settings.webp\" alt=\"google ads script settings - date range\" width=\"900\" height=\"209\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85933 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-settings.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-settings-480x111.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can <strong>use other settings<\/strong> within the script code to include only certain campaigns, exclude certain campaigns, or include or exclude paused or enabled campaigns and ad groups.

Just make sure you<strong> don\u2019t change any of the surrounding punctuation marks as that might break the script<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-campaign-selection.webp\" alt=\"google ads scripts - asset selection\" width=\"974\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85930 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-campaign-selection.webp 974w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-campaign-selection-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 974px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The last thing we need to do in the settings section is to <strong>decide how many words<\/strong> we want to include in our n-gram analysis. For the example I have earlier, we did an n-gram of one. That means that we looked at how individual words performed across all search queries. But we can look at longer strings as well.<\/p>\n<p>By default, you can see the minimum is one and the max is two. That means that only single or two-word phrases will be included in this report. I like to change this number to four so that I will find single words, two-word phrases, three-word phrases, and four-word phrases for my account. This is just a personal preference. You can adjust to whatever you want.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-script-word-selection.webp\" alt=\"google ads n-gram script - word count setting\" width=\"900\" height=\"212\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85932 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-script-word-selection.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-scripts-n-gram-script-word-selection-480x113.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you have those finished, you&#8217;ll be prompted twice to authorize the scripts to run.

There will be a series of three tabs for each level of n-gram you decide to run. There will be a campaign, ad group, and account level for each. So for my example, I ended up having 12 tabs added to my spreadsheet. A campaign, ad group, and account level tab with n-grams of one to four.<\/p>\n<p>In the image below, you can see what the report looks like. It has the n-gram itself along with stats on cost, clicks, impressions, conversions, cost per conversion, as well as a few others. Now that this data is in a spreadsheet, we can play with it to get a better understanding of how these words or phrases performed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis.webp\" alt=\"google ads n-gram analysis example\" width=\"900\" height=\"392\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85924 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis-480x209.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are a handful of ideas for filters that you can use on your n-gram reports:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>High cost, no conversions<\/li>\n<li>High impressions, low clicks<\/li>\n<li>Low cost per conversion query<\/li>\n<li>High Conversion Value query<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Honestly, you can use any type of filter that you would use for your regular search terms report review. Rather than being limited to the queries as they show up in the interface, now you can understand how different word phrases perform in your account.<\/p>\n<p>A more specific example I have came directly from a client question. While they do accept phone calls, they prefer for users to fill out the form on the site for easier intake. So their question was, \u201cHow often do people search for phone numbers and do they convert better or worse than other terms?\u201d To the n-grams we go!<\/p>\n<p>This report makes it very simple. I can go to the account single word and tab, filter for phone. Easy peasy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis-for-search-terms.webp\" alt=\"google ads n-gram analysis - single word report\" width=\"990\" height=\"71\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85923 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis-for-search-terms.webp 990w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis-for-search-terms-980x70.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-n-gram-analysis-for-search-terms-480x34.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 990px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But taking this one step further, I can then go to the two-word tab and review \u201cphone number\u201d as well as any other instance where the word \u201cphone\u201d is included. I can then compare how those perform to our original phrase in question. The findings from this quick review will end up dictating whether we start bidding on phone call terms and accepting phone calls conversion, or if we retain a lead form primary conversion action in the account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-script-n-gram-example.webp\" alt=\"google ads n-gram analysis - two words\" width=\"900\" height=\"120\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85926 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-script-n-gram-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-script-n-gram-example-480x64.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are also tabs for campaign or ad group-level n-grams as well.

Again, this is a pretty limited example, but you can start to see how understanding the way certain terms perform in your account can be valuable, especially if you review them at the account, campaign, and ad group levels to create much more targeted<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/negative-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> negative keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of n-Gram analysis is it can tell you the shorter phrases that either do or don\u2019t perform well in your account so that you can add them either as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/keyword-prioritization\">keyword<\/a> or a negative.

The script is designed to overwrite the data on the tab within the spreadsheet. But I found that if I left my filters on then the data doesn\u2019t populate fully on that page. All you have to do is remove the filters and you should be good to go.<\/p>\n<h2>Find your best search terms using the n-grams script for Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s it.
