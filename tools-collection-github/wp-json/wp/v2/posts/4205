Sure, you can search keywords to filter through your massive collection of emails, but you can do a lot more with it than that.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-search-gmail-1.png\" alt=\"email search gmail\" width=\"948\" height=\"269\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Take full advantage of the search bar with these tips below. In the Gmail search bar, try typing in:<\/p>\n<p><strong>From: | <\/strong>Search all messages from a specific sender<\/p>\n<p><strong>To: |<\/strong> Search all messages sent to a specific recipient<\/p>\n<p><strong>OR |<\/strong> Search all messages with term A or B.

This search is great for clearing up space by finding and deleting messages with hefty file attachments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After: | <\/strong>Search messages sent or received after a specific date<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before: | <\/strong>Search messages sent or received before a specific date. Combine before and after for further precision:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Older_than: \/ newer_than: | <\/strong>Similar to above, but instead of exact dates you can use days (d), months (m) or years (y).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-search-by-date-1.png\" alt=\"gmail search by date\" width=\"732\" height=\"243\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are tons more strings you can search using \u201cin:\u201d \u201cis:\u201d and \u201chas:\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/mail\/answer\/7190?hl=en\">see them all.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Best Gmail Hacks: 15 Bonus Gmail Tips<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Those Dots are Meaningless!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Believe it or not \u2013 <a href=\"mailto:veronica.mars@gmail.com\">veronica.mars@gmail.com<\/a> is the <em>same thing<\/em> as <a href=\"mailto:ver.on.ica.mar.s@gmail.com\">ver.on.ica.mar.s@gmail.com<\/a> OR <a href=\"mailto:veronicamars@gmail.com\">veronicamars@gmail.com<\/a> \u2013 all these address variations can be used for a single email address. Pretty awesome!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>The Undo Button<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve all wished life had an undo button \u2013 for those awkward responses that blurted out of your mouth, for that bus you could have caught if you had ran just a smidge faster, for that stray hand that knocked your coffee all over your keyboard. Well life has just been upgraded \u2013 turns out there <em>is<\/em> an undo button. Well, it\u2019s only for Gmail, but it\u2019s a start.<\/p>\n<p>Activate the \u201cUndo\u201d button by clicking the <strong>Gear Icon<\/strong> in the upper right corner, going to <strong>Settings<\/strong>, and then heading over to the <strong>Labs<\/strong> tab. A few options down you\u2019ll see the ability to enable Gmail\u2019s undo button. There\u2019s a ton of other awesome stuff in GLabs, which we\u2019ll be exploring in some of our other Gmail hacks below.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-secrets-1.png\" alt=\"gmail secrets\" width=\"642\" height=\"52\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>You can choose your cancellation period \u2013 I do 30 secs as a wide safety net<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Super Stars!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Most of you probably know about Google\u2019s yellow star that you can use to mark important emails. Don\u2019t stop there though \u2013 head over to settings and see the 12 different stars and symbols you can use to designate value in your Gmail inbox.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-tricks-and-secrets-1.png\" alt=\"gmail tricks and secrets\" width=\"735\" height=\"146\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>4.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Density<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Feeling a little claustrophobic in Google Mail? Here\u2019s a nice Gmail secret &#8211; change your Gmail\u2019s spacing by hitting that little ol\u2019 gear icon and changing the density. Choose what feels right for you!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-hacks-2014-1.png\" alt=\"gmail hacks 2014\" width=\"177\" height=\"323\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Cozy as a cuddle by the fire in a log cabin. And it\u2019s snowing.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Canned Responses<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re sending out the same e-mail a bunch of times, make it easy on yourself with canned responses. First, turn on the <strong>Canned Responses<\/strong> feature in <strong>Gmail Labs<\/strong>. Now just write your email and click the extra drop down bit on the bottom of your message, beside the trash can. Go to <strong>Canned Responses<\/strong> and click <strong>New Canned Response<\/strong> to name and save your canned response.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/creating-canned-responses-1.png\" alt=\"gmail canned responses\" width=\"602\" height=\"604\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, next time you go to compose a new email, go to canned responses and you\u2019ll see the option to insert your saved canned response.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, I already have a canned response for apartment hunting, as I end up sending the same response (blurb about myself, what I\u2019m looking for in an apartment, when I am available to stop by and see it) multiple times. Once a canned response in inserted, any personalization needed can be added to the template before sending it off.<\/p>\n<p>The ability to create canned responses is a very cool Gmail secret that you probably won\u2019t use most days, but when you do need it, you\u2019ll be glad it\u2019s there.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Desktop Notifications<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gmail desktop notifications let you instantly know when you\u2019ve received a new email via a pop-up. This sweet little feature is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and can be activated under <strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>General<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Mute Conversations<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Tired of watching your co-workers jabber on about things that don\u2019t apply to you? Not a problem with Google Gmail\u2019s ability to mute conversations.<\/p>\n<p>With your conversation open, just go to <strong>More<\/strong>, and select <strong>Mute<\/strong>. Now that conversation won\u2019t pop back up to your attention unless a new message is addressed just to you, or if you\u2019re added to the To: or CC: fields.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Archiving Emails<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Archiving emails is a great way to keep your Inbox clean without deleting emails, letting you appear a normal, healthy internet user while secretly hoarding a decade collection of old emails. It\u2019s the perfect tool for online spring cleaning!<\/p>\n<p>For example, my Gmail \u201csocial\u201d tab is pretty flooded \u2013 it\u2019s mostly messages about Meetup groups I\u2019m a part of, or upcoming events. I don\u2019t want to unsubscribe to these emails because there\u2019s a chance that someday I really will go to the Wednesday African Drum Circle at the MFA. However, I\u2019m getting waaay too many emails from these sorts of things. Here\u2019s what I can do for a quick Gmail inbox clean up.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to use our search string from earlier to select all emails in my Social tab that are older than 6 days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BONUS TIP:<\/strong> Clicking the <strong>Select All<\/strong> box (the one highlighted in pink below) only selects all the emails shown on that page. To select <em>all<\/em> emails that match your search, click the link that appears in the pop up (highlighted in blue).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-tips-1.png\" alt=\"gmail tips &amp; tricks\" width=\"1107\" height=\"236\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now that I have all the emails that match my search string selected, I can just hit the <strong>Archive<\/strong> button. Goodbye old emails! Ah, that feels better already.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/clean-up-gmail-inbox-1.png\" alt=\"clean up gmail\" width=\"398\" height=\"200\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>9.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Send + Archive: Goodbye Email Clutter<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Send + Archive<\/strong> is the next step in super archiving power, letting you send an email and immediately archive it. This features needs to be turned on in the <strong>Settings<\/strong> menu before you can start using it.<\/p>\n<p>Now when you reply to an email, you\u2019ll see the option to <strong>Send + Archive<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/clean-up-gmail-1.png\" alt=\"clean up gmail\" width=\"304\" height=\"197\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This means that the email will be archived away, out of your Inbox. You can rest easy knowing that if someone replies to your archived email, it will reappear in your Inbox, delivered to your attention.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>How to Find Archived Emails<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The easiest way to find emails once you\u2019ve archived them is to use the search string <strong>All Mail:<\/strong>\u00a0 . You can also use the search drop down.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-gmail-1.png\" alt=\"google gmail\" width=\"653\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>11.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Gmail Offline<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that you can read and reply to emails, even when offline? The <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/gmail-offline\/ejidjjhkpiempkbhmpbfngldlkglhimk\">Gmail Offline Chrome app<\/a> syncs messages and queues actions you\u2019ve taken offline to implement later, when internet access is available. Now you can be productive anywhere!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>12.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Gmail Email Tasks<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Say goodbye to scribbled to-do lists on Post It notes. Gmail has its own built-in task list! Just open or select and email, click <strong>More<\/strong>, and hit <strong>Add to Tasks<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-tasks-1.png\" alt=\"gmail tasks\" width=\"720\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You\u2019ll see your custom Gmail task list appear; from there you can add more tasks, add due dates, check off completed tasks, and more.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/using-gmail-tasks-1.png\" alt=\"using gmail tasks\" width=\"239\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Start a task item with a date and the task will automatically be added to your Google Calendar (provided that you turn on the \u201ctask\u201d calendar in the My Calendars section of Google Calendar. Gmail tasks is a great way to stay on top of daily to-dos.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>13.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Creating Custom Gmail Filters<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gmail filters can do a ton of email heavy lifting for you, if you\u2019ll let them. Start by creating a filter from an existing message. I\u2019ve been doing some apartment hunting lately, and have been sending out a lot of emails through Craigslist. Keeping all those messages organized is important to me, so I\u2019ll make a filter for them.<\/p>\n<p>First we\u2019ll select an email to base my filter off of. Then we can head over to <strong>More &gt;<\/strong> <strong>Filter messages like these.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-filters-1.png\" alt=\"gmail filters\" width=\"807\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to <strong>add the parameters of my filter<\/strong>. I\u2019m going to keep this one simple \u2013 I\u2019m going to create a filter for any emails that have the words \u201capartment\u201d and \u201ccraigslist\u201d in the subject line, since that\u2019s the subject line I\u2019ve been using for my apartment hunting emails.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-gmail-filters-1.png\" alt=\"how to use gmail filters\" width=\"588\" height=\"418\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to <strong>decide what action the filter will take<\/strong>. I\u2019m going to have this filter add the label \u201cApartment Hunting\u201d and star the email. And now we\u2019re in business!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/creating-gmail-filters-1.png\" alt=\"creating gmail filters\" width=\"590\" height=\"493\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>(Note: to edit existing Filters, go to Settings &gt; Filters tab)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another great and easy way to set up filters is with custom email aliases. You can <strong>add any +word to your user name <\/strong>and still have those messages delivered to your regular address.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when I sign up for H&amp;M offers, I can use the email address <a href=\"mailto:veronicamarrs+HM@gmail.com\">veronicamarrs+HM@gmail.com<\/a>, but all the messages will still be delivered to <a href=\"mailto:veronicamarrs@gmail.com\">veronicamarrs@gmail.com<\/a>. Why is this helpful? Now when I create a custom filter, I can create an action for all messages from the address alias. For example, I might create a filter that adds a Fashion label to all messages addressed to <a href=\"mailto:veronicamarrs+HM@gmail.com\">veronicamarrs+HM@gmail.com<\/a>. And that\u2019s how to make a Gmail filter. It\u2019s pretty easy to do and can make a HUGE difference when it comes to keeping your email organized.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>14.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>See Messages Meant JUST For You<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Personal level indicators are arrows next to your messages that show whether an email was <strong>sent directly to you (&gt;&gt;)<\/strong> or <strong>you and other recipients (&gt;).<\/strong> It\u2019s a nifty little Gmail trick you can activate in the Settings section (scroll about half way down the General tab).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-gmail-hacks-1.png\" alt=\"best gmail hacks\" width=\"618\" height=\"69\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>15.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Gmail Labels<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Labels make it easy to keep your Gmail so fresh and so clean (clean, clean). Individual emails can have multiple labels \u2013 customize them with bright colors to keep track of what\u2019s what.<\/p>\n<p>People are often confused about <strong>how to add folders to Gmail<\/strong>, but Gmail doesn\u2019t technically have folders. Instead, it has labels. Gmail labels can mark emails that live in your Inbox, and can also be used as folders. To move an email into a label folder, select or open an email and choose the <strong>Move To<\/strong> option to move the email into the label.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-labels-1.png\" alt=\"gmail labels\" width=\"386\" height=\"162\" \/><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Extra Gmail Add-On Features<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of great applications that enable you to do some pretty remarkable stuff with Gmail.
