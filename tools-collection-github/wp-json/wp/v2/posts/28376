Here, you\u2019ll find short video tutorials on how to use a range of Photoshop\u2019s most commonly used features, such as masking, color correction, cropping, vector and shape tools, and working with layers and levels.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gotten a taste of Photoshop\u2019s broad tool set, you can move into project-based tutorials, which walk you through a complete project from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BONUS:<\/strong> If you\u2019re looking for a more immersive introduction to Photoshop, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobeknowhow.com\/courselanding\/beginners-adobe-photoshop\">this free 13-hour introductory course<\/a> that will cover everything you need to know to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>2.
