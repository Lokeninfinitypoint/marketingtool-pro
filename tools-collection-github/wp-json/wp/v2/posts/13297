Now, \u201cexact\u201d might as well be \u201cbroad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SKAG accounts had one last hope: phrase match. Up until the change, phrase match locked in the order of keywords and didn\u2019t allow for implied words to take the chosen word\u2019s place.<\/p>\n<p>For all the value they brought, there are three really important reasons SKAGs no longer hold their own against other PPC strategies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Campaign limits on negatives:<\/strong> A <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6372658?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search campaign can \u201conly\u201d have 10,000 negatives<\/a>. Because negatives don\u2019t allow for close variants, but active keywords do, it will be impossible to fully protect a given ad group or campaign from all the negatives needed to protect against waste and direct traffic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Budget constraints: <\/strong>If a keyword has an auction price (top of page\/average CPC) that exceeds 10% of the campaign daily budget, it makes it challenging to secure value out of the campaign. Over split campaigns won\u2019t have enough fuel for their keywords, and giant campaigns tend to have budget allocation issues. This means important parts of the business starve while high-volume keywords get all the budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time investment:<\/strong> Healthy ad groups will have three ads per ad group, and the ability to create three unique\/interesting ads for SKAGs presents a true challenge for even the most prolific copywriters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is one use case of SKAGs I heartily support and hope continues on: a single long-tail broad keyword with every other keyword added as an exact match negative.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy allows you to gather data on how your prospects may be searching\u2014and at what auction price you can secure them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"81652791-a37a-4bf9-8175-607a0e1ff45d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/single-theme-ad-group-stag.jpg\" alt=\"STAG\" width=\"750\" height=\"508\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>STAGs are here to save the day!<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>STAGs: The new solution<\/h2>\n<p>Single theme ad groups focus on themes rather than syntax, ensuring there are three to five similar themed keyword concepts per ad group.<\/p>\n<p>STAG <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">account structure<\/a> will follow one of the following formats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Service\/product category as the campaign:<\/strong> Audience\/messaging governing the ad groups.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location\/market as the campaign:<\/strong> Products\/services as the ad groups.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Profit probability as the campaign:<\/strong> Corresponding products\/services as the ad groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The benefit of running a STAG structure is in the ability to set budgets aligned with profit as opposed to PPC mechanics. <strong>No more budgeting for every variant under the sun<\/strong><strong>\u2014you can now play favorites and direct budget where it will do the most good<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s true this structure misses out on perfect keyword to ad to landing page relevancy, it more than makes up for it in the metrics that matter: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\">ROAS<\/a>, impression share, and conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>An easy way to make close variants an innovative \u201chack\u201d as opposed to a frustrating thwarter of structure is to bid on the mistake. For example, the word \u201coxygen concentrator\u201d usually goes for $7-$8 per click, but by bidding on the variant (in this case, the misspelling), we\u2019re able to secure $4-$5 average CPCs. At scale, this means we can usually fit at least one extra click per day, increasing the odds that our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rate<\/a> will secure us a lead.<\/p>\n<p>Audiences have all but killed the need for perfect keyword matching because they allow you to prequalify traffic before you invest in them.<\/p>\n<p>Layering<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/31\/in-market-audiences-for-search\"> in-market<\/a> and custom affinity audiences on search campaigns ensures the budget is going where it can do the most good (and protecting against dubious intent).<\/p>\n<p>For example, bidding on the keyword \u201cmoving services\u201d can apply to a local mover who will help a renter move to a new apartment, just as much as it can apply to a several hundred thousand dollar deal to relocate an office.\u00a0 With audiences, you can exclude the intent that isn\u2019t a good fit (and driving up your costs\/giving you false positives on cost effectiveness).<\/p>\n<h2>How to migrate from SKAG to STAG<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re ready to embrace the new way! Huzzah STAGs! Now, time to restructure your account to reflect this change.<\/p>\n<p>Restructures always come with some risk for disruption to lead volume and short term performance fluctuations, but there are ways to mitigate them. Here are three rules to follow to make your restructuring from SKAG to STAG simple.<\/p>\n<h3>Rule #1: If you trust your conversions, don\u2019t move them<\/h3>\n<p>Restructures almost always mean initiating learning periods and fluctuation in performance. The biggest culprit is often pausing a converting keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Working through a restructure means creating a lot of net new entities\u2014even if the long term will benefit, you still need to protect your short-term KPIs. As a rule, the keyword\/ad group\/campaign with conversions should get to stay put.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in the below example, we would work on moving \u201crigging,\u201d \u201crigger,\u201d and \u201crig\u201d keyword concepts into the \u201cNJ Rigging\u201d ad group.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f3124030-8489-43ee-9c92-9fc074bec1ac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/single-theme-ad-group-account-structure.jpg\" alt=\"single theme ad group account view\" width=\"768\" height=\"389\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A big reason for this is you want some stability built into the restructure as opposed to having a complete rebuild.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re faced with multiple keywords\/ad groups with good conversion data, then allow auction price to be your guide.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d69fbbd5-c3f8-4f33-ba55-6400bf0fef8f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/single-theme-ad-group-cpc.jpg\" alt=\"single theme ad group CPC\" width=\"790\" height=\"362\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In the above example, we see that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">average CPC<\/a> for \u201crigging\u201d concepts is cheaper than \u201cmover\u201d concepts, so there\u2019s a priority on moving those first because mistakes aren\u2019t as costly.<\/p>\n<h3>Rule #2: Not everything will make the cut<\/h3>\n<p>It can be hard to break up with a keyword, but sometimes for the good of the account, sacrifices have to be made. If a keyword is just a variant of another keyword, it likely needs to be paused. Additionally, there may be keyword concepts that just don\u2019t fit the budget. Use this time to take stock of keywords that are truly important versus could be covered by others or highlighted in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/12\/automated-ad-extensions\">extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Rule #3: Pause so you can try again<\/h3>\n<p>One of the classic blunders in PPC is changing an ad or keyword as opposed to duplicating them and changing the duplicate. The moment you make a change, the entity is gone, and you need to deal with the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/13\/learning-period\"> ramp up period for a net new entity<\/a> without the safety net of going back to your original entity.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important that you give your new structure the time it needs to prove itself (and that you embark on this restructuring journey at a time when you can handle some flux).<\/p>\n<h2>Time to embrace STAGs<\/h2>\n<p>Abandoning a workflow or process can be scary\u2014humans are incredibly habitual creatures. Yet the data paints an optimistic picture: We will be able to free ourselves of granular mechanics in favor of strategic pragmatism.<\/p>\n<p>Managing an account will now be about what it should always be about: data-driven lead generation governed by profit centers and priority markets. If a campaign is built, it\u2019s built because it directly ties into a business need, as opposed to attempting to game PPC mechanics. This shift is a good thing, and you should embrace STAGs to make the most of it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With Google&#8217;s recent match type changes, using singe keyword ad groups, or SKAGs, is no longer a reliable strategy.
