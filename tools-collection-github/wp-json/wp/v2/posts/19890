That means time management can be a struggle, and growth depends on finding ways to get client work done more efficiently without sacrificing quality.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retainer pricing with a set-up fee is the top pricing option. <\/strong>Agency pricing structures vary, but almost twice as many agencies use a flat-fee or retainer structure compared to charging as a percentage of spend. Further, about twice as many agencies charge a set-up fee compared to agencies that don\u2019t.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Growth is its own challenge.<\/strong> Most agencies want to grow the amount of paid search spend they manage this year by more than 25%, but they also cite landing new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/02\/client-communication\">clients<\/a> as one of their biggest challenges.
