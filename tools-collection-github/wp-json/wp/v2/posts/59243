Ecommerce is here to stay, and businesses who want to stay afloat will need to stay on top of ecommerce trends and technology. So what are the trends of today? Read on to learn the ecommerce website and marketing trends to align with this year.<\/p>\n<h2>2022 ecommerce website trends<\/h2>\n<p>Given the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chromatix.com.au\/web-design\/latest-internet-web-statistics-covid\/\">ecommerce statistics<\/a> above, having a top-notch ecommerce website should be a top priority for businesses looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">increase online sales<\/a>. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few of the ecommerce website strategies and features that are working for businesses in 2022.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Buy now pay later<\/h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/experience-cloud\/digital-insights\/digital-economy-index.html\">Adobe\u2019s 2021 Digital Economy Index<\/a>, buy now pay later (BNPL) options increased 166% YoY in March 2021. Names like Klarna and Square have boomed recently, with their ads popping up all over YouTube. According to this<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/04\/buy-now-pay-later-boom-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-this-holiday-season.html\"> CNBC article<\/a>, BNPL options have been largely driven by younger shoppers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-afterpay.png\" alt=\"ecommerce website trends buy now pay later\" width=\"720\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-afterpay.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-afterpay-480x289.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/buy-now-pay-later-market-report\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Conversion rate optimization<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of those always trending trends. For many sites, getting more customers isn&#8217;t about getting more traffic, but converting more traffic. This is what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion-rate-optimization\">conversion rate optimization <\/a>(CRO) is all about, and as UX technology becomes more accessible to us, so too do consumers\u2019 expectations on our sites.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/02\/ecommerce-seo\">ecommerce SEO<\/a> is still important, some businesses will be wise to reallocate some budget that would be used for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">driving traffic<\/a>, to efforts to better convert that traffic such as by adding calls to action in more places, A\/B testing elements, and improving page speed. Page speed will also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\"> improve your Core Web Vitals<\/a>\u2014a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/25\/seo-trends\">2022 SEO trend <\/a>for all businesses and industries.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-ab-test-website.png\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing trends - ab test on website\" width=\"720\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-ab-test-website.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-ab-test-website-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nosto.com\/products\/ab-testing-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Serverless architecture<\/h3>\n<p>As ecommerce grows, sites will continue to look for ways to cope with spikes in demands. With serverless architecture (for example, AWS Lambda), the cloud provider dynamically allocates resources, so you can scale elastically without having to provision or manage any servers.<\/p>\n<p>The technology has proven itself in other industries, so it&#8217;s natural that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\"> ecommerce websites<\/a> are adopting this flexible option. The benefits are obvious: no downtime due to scaling issues, significantly decreased costs (no need for extra servers), easy debugging from a single point of entry from the developer side, among other things.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Headless CMS<\/h3>\n<p>Headless technology eliminates page templates, backend code, and other cumbersome components that can slow down a website. Gi<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tech-tajawal\/why-headless-cms-is-becoming-so-popular-57d262b1e096\"><\/a>ven that consumer expectations are always on the rise, the headless approach enables businesses to quickly enhance their platform&#8217;s performance so they can better handle spikes in traffic or increases in sales volume without having to create new pages or otherwise employ unnecessary resources for delivering an optimized experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-headless-cms-vs-traditional-cms.jpeg\" alt=\"ecommerce website trends - headless CMS\" width=\"512\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59255\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-headless-cms-vs-traditional-cms.jpeg 512w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-website-trends-headless-cms-vs-traditional-cms-480x438.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.netsolutions.com\/insights\/what-is-headless-cms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Conversational commerce<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/04\/chatbots\">Chatbots<\/a> help to increase engagement with your customers, provide personalized experiences, and offer faster support. You can use them to answer common questions, suggest products, route leads, or make announcements. Using chatbots for direct sales is also on the rise: around 60% of millennials are buying basic goods like food and clothes via conversational software.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yotpo.com\/blog\/conversational-commerce\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-converational-commerce.png\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing trends - conversational commerce\" width=\"720\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-converational-commerce.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-converational-commerce-480x307.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yotpo.com\/blog\/conversational-commerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Ecommerce marketing trends 2022<\/h2>\n<p>While we see new strategies emerge each year, there is often overlap with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/31\/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends\">ecommerce marketing trends<\/a> from one year to the next. Below is a mix of new and emerging trends to jump on.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Shoppable live streams<\/h3>\n<p>More and more users prefer to engage with their products using a video rather than just pictures. In 2022 there will be a stronger focus on creating videos that personalize the experience while interacting with your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember good old-fashioned home shopping channels? Well they\u2019ve made a bit of a comeback, namely via streaming channels. Think YouTube, Facebook Live and Switch. The premise is pretty much the same &#8211; except your presenter is an influencer. It\u2019s unedited, and the audience can interact with the host in real-time. It boomed during the pandemic as it offered customers a safer way to shop, but it\u2019s showing no sign of going anywhere fast. In fact, in November 2021 alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/13\/digital-marketing-trends-2022\">Moriarty\u2019s made $30,000 from its livestream show<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/youtube-live-example.png\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing - shoppable youtube live example\" width=\"720\" height=\"322\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/youtube-live-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/youtube-live-example-480x215.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>7.

Virtual payment methods<\/h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies saw a huge rise in popularity over the last year, and we expect this trend to continue \u2013 but only after overcoming some hurdles.<\/p>\n<p>These currencies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) don&#8217;t yet have the big-name recognition necessary for wide-scale adoption, but they will become more widespread as people see how cryptocurrencies work. While cryptocurrencies don&#8217;t make sense for every business, those who do adopt them could provide an edge over their competition due to reduced fees and faster payment processing times.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile payments is another field that has seen enormous growth: According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/911914\/number-apple-pay-users\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista<\/a>, Global iPhone users that activated Apple Pay grew by more than 65 million people in 2020, with the number of people using Android Pay also on the increase. Mobile payments now account for one-third of digital purchases, and this is expected to rise as alternative methods such as Bitcoin gain further traction.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay.png\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing trends - growth of apple pay\" width=\"720\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay-480x364.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9. B2B ecommerce<\/h3>\n<p>The lines between B2C and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/02\/b2b-marketing-strategies\">B2B marketing<\/a> are becoming increasingly blurred, and the global B2B ecommerce market is expected to\u00a0reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/business-to-business-b2b-e-commerce-market\">$256 trillion<\/a> by 2028. This can be attributed not only to advancements in technology and the corresponding reductions in costs, but also because these companies are feeling pressure to keep up \u2013 and growing their turnover online is an increasingly popular option.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/18\/ecommerce-tools-for-local-business\">ecommerce tools for small and local businesses<\/a> become more widely available, we&#8217;ll see more B2B businesses, large and small, shifting to online or creating an ecommerce revenue stream.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Augmented reality<\/h3>\n<p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are predicted to have a big year, and not just in the ecommerce world! In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/mobidev.biz\/blog\/augmented-reality-trends-future-ar-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysts <\/a>predict that the AR market will reach $198 billion in 2025. That&#8217;s a lot of money!<\/p>\n<p>AR is great for ecommerce because it can create an interactive and engaging experience for customers. For example, they can try on clothes or accessories without having to go into a physical store, or they could see how furniture would look in their home before making a purchase. This is an important trend to tap into.<a href=\"https:\/\/techsee.me\/blog\/augmented-reality-use-cases\/\"><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-augmented-reality-fashion-ecommerce-goat-try-on-app.png\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing trends - augmented reality\" width=\"584\" height=\"537\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59251\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-augmented-reality-fashion-ecommerce-goat-try-on-app.png 584w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-augmented-reality-fashion-ecommerce-goat-try-on-app-480x441.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 584px, 100vw\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/swankyagency.com\/augmented-reality-fashion-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>11. Omnichannel experience<\/h3>\n<p>The omnichannel experience is proving a big trend for 2022. Customers want to be able to switch seamlessly between different devices and platforms when shopping. If they start a purchase on their phone, they should be able to finish it on their laptop, and companies that aren\u2019t up to scratch will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel.jpeg\" alt=\"ecommerce marketing trends - omnichannel marketing\" width=\"720\" height=\"443\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel-480x295.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.knorex.com\/blog\/articles\/omnichannel-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Customers say that being able to use more than one channel while shopping is important to them.
