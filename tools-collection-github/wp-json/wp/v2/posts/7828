Slow down or speed up your video.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Effects: <\/strong>Add\u00a0filters and stickers; you can also use any of the filters you have previously created.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Touch up<\/strong>: For that smooth\u00a0skin look.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timer:<\/strong> Set a timer for hands-free video recording.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After you hit the Record button, you&#8217;ll see a 3-2-1 countdown before you start recording.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Record, preview and edit each clip<\/h3>\n<p>As you record, you&#8217;ll see a progress bar at the top of the screen to help you stay within your time limit.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done recording, hit preview on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-recording-and-preview-screen-1.png\" alt=\"how to use instagram reels for business\u2014recording and preview screen\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Remember, Reels allows you to stitch together clips that you record new clips\u00a0<strong>or<\/strong> upload from your gallery, so you can add in those as well.<\/p>\n<p>Once you hit preview,\u00a0you\u2019ll have additional editing options, as well as the original options if you didn&#8217;t choose them prior to recording.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-additional-effects-screen-1.png\" alt=\"how to create instagram reels for business\u2014additional effects screen\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Audio controls: <\/strong>adjust camera audio, add music (if you haven&#8217;t already).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Voiceover<\/strong>: record audio over the video.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decorations<\/strong>: add GIFs, stickers, emojis, countdowns, labels, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pen<\/strong>: make lines, arrows, scribbles, or write something<\/li>\n<li><strong>Text<\/strong>: overlay text in different colors<\/li>\n<li><strong>Alignment:<\/strong>\u00a0Align objects from the previous clip before recording the next one to create smooth transitions for moments, like changing clothes or new characters appearing in the video.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Publish your Reel<\/h3>\n<p>Once you are done recording and editing all of your clips, select the &#8220;Share To&#8221; button at the bottom right (as shown above), where you&#8217;ll be taken to the publishing screen. Here you can choose a cover, write a caption, add hashtags, and then publish your Reels.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/16\/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads\">TikTok vs. Reels Ads: Which Performs Better?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<section class=\"section\">\n<h2>Tips for creating Instagram Reels for business<\/h2>\n<p>You can edit video clips in the Reel app itself or use other video editing apps if you want to get super creative with it. If you need to schedule your reels out, you can always use platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Later<\/a> or the like to get your video content planned ahead instead of directly in the app.\u00a0Here are some more tips for using <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-instagram-reels-for-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Reels for business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use music AND closed captions<\/h3>\n<p>Each time you use music, your Reel gets exposed to that specific song\u2019s tag. It\u2019s similar to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a> with the\u00a0potential of more reach. And since there are plenty of users that don\u2019t keep their sound on\u2014yes, even while they are scrolling through Reels\u2014it\u2019s good to put on those captions so they can engage with the sound off.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tips-for-creating-instagram-reels-for-business-use-captions-1.png\" alt=\"example of instagram reel for business with captions\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CMFgq21HlKm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View Reel here<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Tag relevant accounts<\/h3>\n<p>Tagging other accounts is highly encouraged in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">Instagram realm<\/a>. You get more reach by putting your content on someone else\u2019s account as well as the potential for them to share your content with their following.\u00a0You can utilize this tip with regular Instagram posts as well.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Push Reels to your feed<\/h3>\n<p>You can organically post your Reel\u00a0as is through the Reel platform (it will then show up in your Reels tab), or also publish it on your own feed. For the most part, it\u2019s a best practice to publish to your feed so that your current audience can engage too. This will also you to build more content and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/05\/promote-instagram-account-free\">promote your account.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Tip: If you use words on your video, try to get them as centered as possible (without obstructing the important parts of the video). When you share your Reel to your feed, it will naturally get cut off as the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/1631821640426723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ratios for posts and Reels<\/a> are different.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Take old Stories and posts and recreate them into Reels<\/h3>\n<p>A big portion of the content creation community <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">repurposes<\/a> older posts and Stories to create their 15-30 second video for Instagram reels. For example, if you just recently traveled somewhere as a business or have some pictures from a job you just completed, you can combine all of those photos into one video.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this example from @cutylife that\u00a0uses\u00a0Jefferson Airplane\u2019s &#8220;Somebody to Love&#8221; for their Reel soundtrack.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-travel-ig-reel-example-1.jpeg\" alt=\"instagram reel example documenting travel\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CPXeNtlhgX5\/?utm_medium=copy_link\">View Reel here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Upload your TikTok videos to Reels<\/h3>\n<p>Did you just <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">post a video to TikTok<\/a>? You can literally post that same video to your Instagram Reels as well! Just make sure it\u2019s all your 30-second versions of those videos (TikTok allows 60 seconds), or you can cut the 60 second video into two Reels\u2014only if it makes sense to cut it.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Add titles to your Reel cover photos<\/h3>\n<p>When someone navigates to your Reels tab, make it easy for them to select which Reel they want to watch. Titling your Reels also gives your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">Instagram followers<\/a> a feel for what kind\u00a0of content\u00a0you post. Useful tips? Inspiring landscapes? Company culture?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-latermedia-reel-gallery-1.png\" alt=\"latermedia's instagram reels gallery\" width=\"300\" height=\"555\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/latermedia\/reels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Instagram Reels ideas and examples for businesses<\/h2>\n<p>There are plenty of free ways to reach your potential customers on Instagram: posts, videos, Stories, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/22\/instagram-tv\">IGTV<\/a>, and now Reels. Here are some of the ways businesses are using Instagram Reels to express, educate, and entertain.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Film yourself giving tips<\/h3>\n<p>You could provide five short tips, one extensive tip, or a preview of a longer video to come. Think about the keywords you target in blog posts, FAQs from customers and prospects, and other videos that have performed well in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social media marketing endeavors.<\/a>\u00a0You won\u2019t believe how much content you will come up with just by answering questions your customers ask you on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-how-to-1.png\" alt=\"instagram reels ideas for business\u2014how-to reel example\" width=\"500\" height=\"449\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CLU-GKKHr0T\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View Reel here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Share customer testimonials or success stories<\/h3>\n<p>Have some of your most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/18\/loyalty-marketing\">loyal customers<\/a> do a 15 to 30 second video on why they love doing business with you. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">Reviews<\/a> are always going to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/05\/social-media-marketing-strategy\">perform well on social media<\/a>, especially video content like Instagram Reels.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Make a blooper Reel out of your Reel bloopers<\/h3>\n<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love bloopers? People love being able to relate to the business owner behind the camera. Use humor to express the lighter side of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">brand personality <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-check-social-media-engagement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve your social media engagement<\/a>\u00a0along the way.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Feature your employees<\/h3>\n<p>Get your employees in on the fun! Feature an employee each week, sharing what they love about working for your business, what they love about their job, or giving tips from their specialty.\u00a0People want to feel connected to who they do business with. Plus, this is a great opportunity to express your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">company&#8217;s core values<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/examples-of-instagram-reels-for-business-adobe-1.jpeg\" alt=\"an example of an employee instagram reel by adobe\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CLZrhSVJSos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>View Reel here<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>11. Provide useful checklists<\/h3>\n<p>Did you start your own business? What were the best\u00a0marketing strategies\u00a0you used to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/28\/growth-strategy\">grow your business<\/a>? The options are endless. A lot of content creators will have the options written out and they will point to them as it goes across the screen, but if that isn\u2019t your style, you can always literally check off on a notepad and go through the tips of your particular topic.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Create before-and-after Reels<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a service company, this will be really easy. Just don\u2019t forget to take some pictures before you start the project\/maintenance\/job.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Promote another business<\/h3>\n<p>You could choose to promote a neighboring small business, or if you&#8217;re a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/02\/b2b-marketing-strategies\">B2B<\/a> company, highlight one of your clients. Shopify does this in the example below, talking about a small, woman-owned landscaping company that went viral.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-busines-feature-another-business-1.png\" alt=\"shopify instagram reel example promoting a small business\" width=\"300\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>14. Share quick and encouraging messages<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to connect with your followers, and one quick way to do that is grab some inspirational quotes based on your business. You can either turn the camera on you and recite these quotes, or closed caption those with a nice moving background. One app I personally use that has been really helpful is <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/subtitles-video-captions-mix\/id1549309791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Subtitles \u2014 Video Captions Mix<\/a>. It saves me a lot of time with handwriting out everything I\u2019m saying.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Talk about the perks of being on your email list and then tell them how to join<\/h3>\n<p>Good cross-promotion strategy here. Do your subscribers get exclusive deals? Early access? Entered into a drawing? Get more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">email signups<\/a>\u00a0with your Reels.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Product highlights or tutorials<\/h3>\n<p>Showcase <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">what makes your business different <\/a>by producing Reels for each product or service your business offers.

Be funny with this one. Try not to placate too much but tell your followers how much you would love to hear their feedback on their service.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Run a Reels contest<\/h3>\n<p>Create a Reel, ask your followers to create a Reel on a topic of your choice, using the same audio for your Reel, and post with a custom hashtag.
