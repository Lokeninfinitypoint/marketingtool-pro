Check out our (free!) all-star playbook to online advertising.<\/a><\/em><\/h3>\n<h2>Average CPC by Country: Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>To determine the relative CPC for each country, I used our <a href=\"\/keywords\">free keyword tool<\/a> to create a list of over 15,000 high-volume English search keywords across over <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/23\/google-revenues\">20 different industries<\/a>. I then took this list and ran it to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a> to get average CPC estimates for these keywords in each country to see how Google estimated their costs per click would differ across the globe. With this list of estimated CPCs by country, I then indexed it and compared each country\u2019s estimated CPC against the estimated CPC of the US to complete this analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Having this data be as unbiased as possible was a priority for me. The decision to use estimates from the Google Keyword Planner data protects this research from any biases from individual clients who target different states or use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/05\/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers\">geo bid modifiers.<\/a> The volume of keywords considered across different industries protects this analysis from a bias of a rogue keyword or industry with spiked regional interest.<\/p>\n<h2>Notable Trends in Average Cost Per Click<\/h2>\n<p>There are some interesting trends in this regional CPC data on Google.<\/p>\n<h3>The Most Expensive Country: United Arab Emirates<\/h3>\n<p>The nation with the highest CPCs (and the only country to have a higher CPC than the United States) is the United Arab Emirates, where CPCs average 8% more than they do within the US. A rich and diverse economy \u2013 which relies on industries such as finance and tourism, known for their high CPCs \u2013 likely helps to put the country at the top of the list.<\/p>\n<h3>The Top 10 Highest CPCs<\/h3>\n<p>Excluding the UAE and the US, the next ten most expensive countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Chile, Switzerland, Italy, Canada, and Germany) all either share strong economic ties to the US, have surging economies, have very high English-speaking populations, or some combination of several of these. Also, in all of these countries, Google acts nearly as a monopoly of search, with no significant competition from other search engines.<\/p>\n<h3>The Effect of Local Search Engines<\/h3>\n<p>Eastern Europe and Russia have a surprising number of spots at the bottom of the list, with incredibly cheap CPCs. We know that some of this is due to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\">struggling Russian economy helping to cut CPCs<\/a> for foreign advertisers. It\u2019s also likely due to the presence of Yandex, a competitor search engine to Google, which has an overwhelming majority share of the market in that corner of the world. In similar markets, where Google doesn\u2019t have a majority share of search, like Japan and South Korea (where Yahoo Japan and Naver are the locals\u2019 search engines of choice), we also see discounted CPCs from Google (much as here, in the US, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">Bing has cheaper CPCs<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>A Growing Mobile Only Audience<\/h3>\n<p>South and Central America, Africa, and much of the Middle East have CPCs far below the US average. While this is likely for a number of economic reasons and limited internet penetration in these regions, a growing factor is the rising number of users who are accessing the internet and Google on their smartphones. Internationally, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/12\/google-adwords-mobile-data\">mobile CPCs are generally cheaper<\/a> than desktop CPCs, so a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/18\/mobile-ad-strategies\">successful mobile strategy<\/a> is an increasingly critical role in converting these international users.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see any other interesting trends in the data?
