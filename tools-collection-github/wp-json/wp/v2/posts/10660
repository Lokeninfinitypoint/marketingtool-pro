Test out your Facebook Shop now, before the holidays hit<\/h3>\n<p>As we quickly approach the holiday season, brands should test out Facebook Shops beforehand to get a better understanding of how it works.

Utilize\u00a0Instagram Checkout to drive conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram Checkout\u00a0was launched over a year ago to a limited number of brand accounts.

Checkout makes it possible for users to purchase the brand\u2019s products directly within the Instagram app, thus, creating a seamless and secure payment in-app option. With the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">heavy impact on businesses this year due to the pandemic<\/a>, it was with great timing that Facebook announced in August that it was rolling out Instagram Checkout to all eligible United States-based business and creator accounts with a Shops integration \u2013 tying together the Shops experience with Checkout\u2019s in-app purchasing capabilities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f6c6585-3bab-46f0-97c8-72c613c0e8ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use20instagram20checkout20to20increase20social20media20ecommerce20advertising20holidays202020.png\" alt=\"use instagram checkout to increase social media ecommerce advertising holidays 2020\" width=\"800\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/introducing-instagram-checkout\"><em> Instagram<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you have not yet done so, check out Instagram Checkout to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/09\/instagram-sales\">drive more Instagram sales this holiday season<\/a>.\u00a0You can either open up a Shop with Checkout on Instagram by using their Commerce Manager, or, if you are already using a third-party platform like Shopify, you can easily integrate it with your account.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/updates-to-checkout-on-instagram-and-shops-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their own blog post\u00a0on Checkout<\/a>, enabling Checkout enables you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce\u00a0friction in the path to purchase<\/li>\n<li>Tag your products in\u00a0other creators&#8217;\u00a0posts<\/li>\n<li>Gain access to\u00a0additional ad products and signals<\/li>\n<li>Create product launch announcements<\/li>\n<li>Enable live shopping for your customers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>RELATED<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/03\/christmas-instagram-captions\">78 [Not Overused!] Holiday &amp; Christmas Instagram Captions<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8.
