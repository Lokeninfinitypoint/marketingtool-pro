No matter how hard you squint you won\u2019t make out every potential pitfall of using large language models and machine learning to create content and manage ads.<\/p>\n<p>So our goal in this article is to view seven of the most prominent risks of using AI for marketing from a very high ground. We\u2019ve rounded up advice from experts to help mitigate these risks. And we\u2019ve added plenty of resources so you can dig deeper into the questions that concern you most.<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #1: Machine learning bias<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes machine learning algorithms give results that are unfairly in favor or against someone or something. It\u2019s called<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchenterpriseai\/feature\/Bias-in-machine-learning-examples-Policing-banking-COVID-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> machine learning bias<\/a>, or AI bias, and it\u2019s a pervasive problem with even the most advanced deep neural networks.<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s a data problem<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not that AI networks are inherently bigoted. It\u2019s a problem with the data that\u2019s fed into them.<\/p>\n<p>Machine learning algorithms work by identifying patterns to calculate the probability of an outcome, like whether or not a particular group of shoppers will like your product.<\/p>\n<p>But what if the data the AI trains on is skewed towards a particular race, gender, or age group? The AI will come to the conclusion that those people are a better match and skew ad creative or placement accordingly.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">bias laundering edition <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/YQLRcq59lQ\">pic.twitter.com\/YQLRcq59lQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Janelle Shane (@JanelleCShane) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JanelleCShane\/status\/1405598023619649537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 17, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Researchers recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/4\/9\/22375366\/facebook-ad-gender-bias-delivery-algorithm-discrimination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tested for gender bias<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">Facebook\u2019s ad targeting<\/a> systems. The investigators placed an ad to recruit delivery drivers for Pizza Hut, and a similar ad with the same qualifications for Instacart.<\/p>\n<p>The existing pool of Pizza Hut drivers skews male, so Facebook showed those ads disproportionately to men. Instacart has more women drivers, so ads for their job were placed in front of more women. But there&#8217;s no inherent reason that women wouldn&#8217;t want to know about the Pizza Hut jobs, so that\u2019s a big misstep in ad targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>AI bias is common<\/h3>\n<p>The problem extends way beyond Facebook. Researchers from USC looked at two large AI databases and found that <a href=\"https:\/\/viterbischool.usc.edu\/news\/2022\/05\/thats-just-common-sense-usc-researchers-find-bias-in-up-to-38-6-of-facts-used-by-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 38% of the data<\/a> in them was biased. <a href=\"https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/guides\/embeddings\/limitations-risks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT\u2019s documentation even warns that<\/a> their algorithm may associate \u201cnegative stereotypes with black women.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/38-biased.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketing - graphic showing that 38% of data was biased\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73235 size-full\" width=\"926\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/38-biased.jpg 926w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/38-biased-480x188.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 926px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Machine learning bias presents several implications for marketers; the least of which is poor ad performance. If you\u2019re hoping to reach the most potential customers possible, an ad targeting platform that excludes large chunks of the population is less than ideal.<\/p>\n<p>Of course there are bigger ramifications if our ads unfairly target, or exclude, certain groups. If your real estate ad discriminates against protected minorities, you could land on the wrong end of the <a href=\"https:\/\/nationalfairhousing.org\/responsibleadvertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fair Housing Act<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/business-guidance\/blog\/2021\/04\/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commision<\/a>.

There are a couple of steps you can take to make sure your ads treat everyone equitably.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, make sure a someone reviews your content, <a href=\"https:\/\/writer.com\/blog\/editorial-skills-and-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes Alaura Weaver<\/a>, the senior manager of content and community at Writer. \u201cWhile AI technology has advanced significantly, it lacks the critical thinking and decision-making abilities that humans have,\u201d she explains. \u201cBy having human editors review and fact-check AI-written content, they can ensure that it\u2019s free from bias and follows ethical standards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Human oversight will reduce the risk of negative outcomes in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/online-advertising-benchmarks\">paid ad campaigns<\/a>, too.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently, and perhaps indefinitely, it is not advisable to let AI completely take over campaigns or any form of marketing,\u201d says Brett McHale, the Founder of<a href=\"https:\/\/empiricmarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Empiric Marketing<\/a>.\u00a0 \u201cAI performs optimally when it receives accurate inputs from organic intelligence that has already accumulated vast amounts of data and experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udea8 Want to learn how to use AI the right way for your marketing?\nFree download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Risk #2: Factual fallacies<\/h2>\n<p>Google recently <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/new-google-chatbots-costly-error-wipes-100bn-off-market-value-12806661\">cost its parent company $100b<\/a> in valuation when its new AI chatbot, Bard, gave an incorrect answer in a promotional tweet.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Bard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA.

It looks to fill in the next word or phrase that\u2019ll answer your query. But it\u2019s not self-aware; AI doesn\u2019t have gut-check logic to know if what it\u2019s stringing together makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike bias, this doesn\u2019t seem to be a data problem. Even when the network has all the right info, it can still tell us the wrong thing.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this example where a user asked ChatGPT \u201chow many times did Argentina win the FIFA world cup?\u201d It said once and referenced the team\u2019s 1978 victory. The tweeter then asked which team won in 1986.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Asked <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/ChatGPT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ChatGPT<\/a> abt who won the FIFA world cup in 2022.

They can also be comprehensive, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/chatgpts-hallucination-just-got-openai-sued-heres-what-happened\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed in a lawsuit<\/a> filed against Open.ai, where ChatGPT allegedly concocted an entire story of embezzlement that was then shared by a journalist.<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid AI\u2019s hallucinations<\/h3>\n<p>While AI can lead you astray with even single-word answers, it\u2019s more likely to go off the rails when writing longer texts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a single prompt, AI can generate a blog or an eBook. Yes, that\u2019s amazing \u2013 but there\u2019s a catch,\u201d Weaver warns. \u201cThe more it generates, the more editing and fact-checking you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To reduce the chances that your AI tool starts spinning hallucinatory narratives, Weaver says it\u2019s best to create an outline and have the bot tackle it one section at a time. And then, of course, have a person review the facts and stats it adds.<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #3: Misapplication of AI tools<\/h2>\n<p>Every morning we wake up to a new crop of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\">AI tools<\/a> that seemingly sprouted overnight like mushrooms after a rainstorm.<\/p>\n<p>But not every platform is built for all marketing functions, and some marketing challenges can\u2019t (yet) be solved by AI.<\/p>\n<h3>AI tools have limitations<\/h3>\n<p>ChatGPT is a great example. The belle of the AI ball is fun to play with (like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnkoetsier\/status\/1610805443953324036?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing how to remove a peanut butter sandwich<\/a> from a VCR in the style of the King James Bible). And it can churn out some surprisingly well-written short form answers that bust up writer\u2019s block. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing#:~:text=6%20ways%20to%20use%20ChatGPT%20for%20marketing%201,surveys%20...%206%206.%20Get%20chatbot%20ideas%20\">don\u2019t ask it to help you do keyword research<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>ChatGPT fails because of its relatively old data set which only includes information pre-2022. Ask it to offer keywords for \u201cAI marketing\u201d and its answers won\u2019t jive with what you find in other tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twinword.com\/\">Thinword<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.contextminds.com\/\">Contextminds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/23\/google-marketing-live\">Google<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2022\/08\/introducing-new-automation-tools-to-increase-sales-and-drive-growth\/\"> Facebook<\/a> have new AI-powered tools to help marketers create ads, optimize ad spend, and personalize the ad experience. A chatbot can\u2019t solve those challenges.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Google-live-4.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketing - large screen from Google's recent Live event\" class=\"wp-image-73237 size-full aligncenter\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Google-live-4.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Google-live-4-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google announced a slew of AI upgrades to its search and ads management products at the 2023 Google Marketing Live event.<\/p>\n<h3>You can overuse AI<\/h3>\n<p>If you give an AI tool a singular task, it can over index on just one goal. Nick Abbene, a <a href=\"http:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/PwCICpYoJQhx1NWoNCDkdl1?domain=nickabbene.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing automation expert<\/a>, sees this often with companies focused on improving their SEO.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest problem I see is using SEO tools blindly, over-optimizing for search engines, and disregarding customer search intent,\u201d Abbene says. \u201cSEO tools are great for signaling to search engines quality content. But ultimately, Google wants to match the searcher&#8217;s ask.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid misapplication of AI tools<\/h3>\n<p>A wrench isn\u2019t the best option for pounding nails. Likewise, an AI writing assistant may not be good for creating web pages. Before you go all in on any one AI option, Abbene says to get feedback from the tool\u2019s builder and other users.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn order to avoid mis selection of AI tools, understand if other marketers are using the tool for your use case,\u201d he says. \u201cFeel free to request a product demo, or trial it alongside some other tools that offer the same functionality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Websites like Capterra let you quickly compare multiple AI platforms.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Capterra-1.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketers - screenshot from Capterra\" class=\"wp-image-73238 size-full aligncenter\" width=\"647\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Capterra-1.jpg 647w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-Capterra-1-480x442.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And once you find the right <a href=\"https:\/\/nickabbene.com\/best-ai-marketing-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI tool stack<\/a>, use it to aid the process, not take it over. \u201cDon&#8217;t be afraid to use AI tools to augment your workflow, but use them just for that,\u201d Abbene says. \u201cBegin each piece of content from first principles, with quality keyword research and understanding search intent.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #4: Homogeneous content<\/h2>\n<p>AI can write an entire essay in about 10 seconds. But as impressive as generative AI has become, it lacks the nuance to be truly creative, leaving its output often feeling, well, robotic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile AI is great at producing content that\u2019s informative, it often lacks the creative flair and engagement that humans bring to the table,\u201d Weaver says.<\/p>\n<h3>AI is made to imitate<\/h3>\n<p>Ask a generative AI writing bot to pen your book report, and it\u2019ll easily spin up 500 words that competently explain the main theme of Catcher in the Rye (assuming it doesn\u2019t hallucinate Holden Caulfield as a bank robber).<\/p>\n<p>It can do that because it\u2019s absorbed thousands of texts about J. D. Salinger\u2019s masterpiece.<\/p>\n<p>Now ask your AI pal to write a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">blog post<\/a> that explains a concept core to your business in a way that encapsulates your brand, audience, and value proposition. You might be disappointed. \u201cAI-generated content doesn\u2019t always account for the nuances of a brand\u2019s personality and values and may produce content that misses the mark,\u201d Weaver says.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In other words, AI is great at digesting, combining, and reconfiguring what\u2019s already been created. It\u2019s not great at creating something that stands out against existing content.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Generative AI tools are also not good at making content engaging. They\u2019ll happily churn out huge blocks of words with nary an image, graph, or bullet point to give weary eyes a rest. They won\u2019t pull in customer stories or hypothetical examples to make a point more relatable. And they\u2019d struggle to connect a news story from your industry to a benefit your product provides.<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid homogenous content<\/h3>\n<p>Some AI tools, like Writer, have built-in features to help writers maintain a consistent brand personality. But you\u2019ll still need an editor to \u201creview, and edit the content for brand voice and tone to ensure that it resonates with the audience and reinforces the organization\u2019s messaging and objectives,\u201d Weaver advises.<\/p>\n<p>Editors and writers can also see an article like other humans will. If there\u2019s an impenetrable block of words, they\u2019ll be the ones to break it up and add a little visual zhuzh.<\/p>\n<p>Use AI content as a starting point\u2014as a way to help kickstart your creativity and research. But always add your own personal touch.<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #5: Loss of SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s stance on AI content has been a little murky. At first, it seemed the search engine would penalize posts written with AI.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/02\/google-search-and-ai-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s developer blog <\/a>said that AI is OK in their book. But there is a significant wink with that confirmation. Only \u201ccontent that demonstrates qualities of what we call E-E-A-T: expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness\u201d will impress the human search raters that continually evaluate Google&#8217;s ranking systems.<\/p>\n<h3>Trust is clutch for SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Among <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">Google\u2019s E-E-A-T<\/a>, the one factor that rules them all is trust.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-EEAT.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketing - diagram showing Google's EEAT method for judging content\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73239 size-full\" width=\"927\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-EEAT.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-EEAT-480x238.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[<a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">source<\/a>]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve already discussed that AI content is prone to fallacies, making it inherently untrustworthy without human supervision. It also fails to meet the supporting requirements because, by nature, it isn\u2019t written by someone with expertise, authority, or experience on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Take a blog post about baking banana bread. An AI bot will give you a recipe in about two seconds. But it can\u2019t wax poetic on the chilly winter days spent baking for its family. Or talk about the years it spent experimenting with various types of flour as a commercial baker. Those perspectives are what Google\u2019s search raters look for.<\/p>\n<p>It also seems to be what people crave, too. That\u2019s why so many of them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/nearly-half-genz-use-tiktok-instagram-over-google-search-2022-7#:~:text=1%20Nearly%2040%25%20of%20Gen%20Z%20prefers%20using,not%20only%20Google%20Search%20but%20also%20to%20YouTube.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are turning to real people on TikTok videos<\/a> to learn things they used to find on Google.<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid losing SEO<\/h3>\n<p>The great thing about AI is it doesn\u2019t mind sharing bylines. So when you do use a chatbot to speed up content production, make sure you reference a human author with credentials.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially true for sensitive subjects like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/healthcare-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthcare<\/a> and personal finance, which Google calls Your Money, Your Life topics. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a YMYL vertical, prioritize authority, trust and accuracy above all else in your content,\u201d advises Elisa Gabbert, Director of Content and SEO for WordStream and LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketers - screenshot of a WebMD article\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73240 size-full\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When writing about healthcare, for example, have your posts reviewed by a medical professional and reference them in the post. That\u2019s a strong signal to Google that your content is trustworthy, even if it was started in a chatbot.<\/p>\n<p>We covered more about how to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/05\/chatgpt-seo\">ChatGPT for SEO<\/a> (the right way) here.<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #6: Legal challenges<\/h2>\n<p>Generative AI learns from work created by humans, then creates something new(ish). The question of copyright is unclear for both the input and output of the AI content model.<\/p>\n<h3>Existing work is likely fair game for AI<\/h3>\n<p>To illustrate (pun intended) the copyright question for works that feed large learning models, we turn to <a href=\"https:\/\/waxy.org\/2022\/11\/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a case reported by technologist Andy Baio<\/a>. As Baio explains, an LA-based artist named Hollie Mengert learned that 32 of her illustrations had been absorbed into an AI model, then offered via open license to anyone that wanted to recreate her style.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd-2.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketers - comparison of original artist work to AI generated versions\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73241 size-full\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd-2.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-webmd-2-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Caption: a collection of artist Hollie Mengert\u2019s illustrations (left) compared with AI generated illustrations based on her style, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/waxy.org\/2022\/11\/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>as curated by Andy Baio<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The story gets more complicated when you learn that she created many of her images for clients like Disney, who actually own the rights to them.<\/p>\n<p>Can illustrators (or writers or coders) who find themselves in the same spot as Mengert successfully sue for copyright infringement?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s not yet a clear answer to the question. \u201cI see people on both sides of this extremely confident in their positions, but the reality is nobody knows,\u201d Baio told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/23444685\/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Verge<\/a>. \u201cAnd anyone who says they know confidently how this will play out in court is wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If the AI you use to create an image or article was trained on thousands of works from many creators, you\u2019re not likely to lose a court case. But if you feed the machine ten Stephen King books and tell the bot to write a new one in that style, you could be in trouble.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong><\/em> We aren\u2019t lawyers so please get legal advice if you\u2019re unsure.<\/p>\n<h3>Your AI content may not be protected either<\/h3>\n<p>What about content you create using a chatbot, is it covered by copyright laws? For the most part, <a href=\"https:\/\/research.aimultiple.com\/generative-ai-copyright\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it\u2019s not<\/a> unless you\u2019ve done considerable work to edit it. Which means you\u2019d have little recourse if someone repurposes (read: steals) your posts for their own blog.<\/p>\n<p>For content that is protected it may be the AI\u2019s programmer, not you, that holds the rights. Many countries consider the maker of the tool that produced a work to be its creator, not the person that typed in the prompt.<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid legal challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Start by using a reputable AI content creation tool. Find one with plenty of positive reviews produced by a company that clearly addresses its stance on copyright laws.<\/p>\n<p>Also, use your good judgment to decide if you\u2019re intentionally copying a creator\u2019s work or simply using AI to augment your own.<\/p>\n<p>And if you want a fighting chance in court to protect what you produce, make lots of substantial changes. Or use AI to help create an outline, but write most of the words yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>Risk #7: Security and privacy breaches<\/h2>\n<p>AI tools present marketers with a broad range of potential threats to their system\u2019s security and data privacy. Some are direct attacks from malicious actors. Others are simply users unwittingly giving sensitive information to a system designed to share it.<\/p>\n<h3>Security risks from AI tools<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThere are plenty of products out there that look, feel, and behave like legitimate tools, but are in fact malware,\u201d Elaine Atwell, the Senior Editor of Content Marketing at endpoint security provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kolide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kolide<\/a>, told us. \u201cThey&#8217;re extremely difficult to differentiate from legitimate tools and you can find them in the Chrome store right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Type any version of \u201cAI tools\u201d into the Google Chrome store and you\u2019ll find no shortage of options.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-chrome-store.jpg\" alt=\"AI for marketing - screenshot from the Chrome store\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73242 size-full\" width=\"760\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-chrome-store.jpg 760w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AI-risks-chrome-store-480x378.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Atwell<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kolide.com\/blog\/ai-browser-extensions-are-a-security-nightmare\"> wrote about these risks<\/a> on the Kolide blog. In her article, she referenced an incident where a Chrome extension called \u201cQuick access to Chat GPT\u201d was actually a ruse. Once downloaded, the software hijacked users\u2019 Facebook accounts and swiped all of the victim\u2019s cookies\u2014even those for security. Over 2,000 people downloaded the extension every day, Atwell reported.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy unprotected<\/h3>\n<p>Atwell says even a legitimate AI tool can present a security risk. \u201c&#8230;right now, most companies don\u2019t even have policies in place to assess the types and levels of risk posed by different extensions. And in the absence of clear guidance, people all over the world are installing these little helpers and feeding them sensitive data.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re writing an internal financial report to be shared with investors. Remember that AI networks learn from what they\u2019re given to produce outputs for other users. All the data you place in the AI chatbot could be fair game for people outside of your company. And may pop up if a competitor asks about your bottom line.<\/p>\n<h3>How to avoid privacy and security risks<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of defense is to make sure a piece of software is what it claims to be. Beyond that, be cautious about how you use the tools you choose. \u201cIf you&#8217;re going to use AI tools (and they do have uses!) don&#8217;t feed them any data that could be considered sensitive,\u201d Atwell says.<\/p>\n<p>Also, while you\u2019re reviewing AI tools for usefulness and bias, ask about their privacy and security policies.<\/p>\n<h2>Mitigate the risks of using AI for marketing<\/h2>\n<p>AI is advancing at an incredible rate. In less than a year Chat GTP has already seen significant boosts in its capabilities. It\u2019s impossible to know what we\u2019ll be able to do with AI in even the next six to twelve months. Nor can we anticipate the potential problems.<\/p>\n<p>Here are several ways you can improve your AI marketing outcomes while avoiding some of the most common risks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have human editors review content for quality, readability, and brand voice<\/li>\n<li>Scrutinize each tool you use for security and capability<\/li>\n<li>Regularly review AI-directed ad targeting for bias<\/li>\n<li>Assess copy and images for potential copyright infringement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019d like to thank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/elaine-atwell-a1b87710b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elain Attwell<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brett-mchale-2b1bb387\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brett McHale,<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nickabbene.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nick Abenne<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alauraweaver\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alaura Weaver<\/a> for contributing to this post.<\/p>\n<p>To recap, let&#8217;s review our list of risks that come with using AI for marketing:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Machine learning bias<\/li>\n<li>Factual fallacies<\/li>\n<li>Misapplication of AI tools<\/li>\n<li>Homogeneous content<\/li>\n<li>Loss of SEO<\/li>\n<li>Legal challenges<\/li>\n<li>Security and privacy breaches<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hippowiz-ass-injected\" value=\"true\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hvmessage-toextension-listener\" value=\"none\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The AI rush is on!
