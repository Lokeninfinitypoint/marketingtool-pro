Uber \u2013 The Smartest Way to Get Around<\/h2>\n<p>Few tech companies are as polarizing or widely criticized as Uber. As one of the most vocal proponents of the empowerment offered by the so-called \u201cgig economy,\u201d Uber has deservedly taken a lot of heat for denying its drivers the basic protections afforded to legal employees, been subject to national and even governmental scrutiny for its decision to incorporate in Bermuda to avoid its corporate tax obligations, and is generally the poster child for why everyone hates Silicon Valley\u2019s unique brand of \u201cdisruption.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One thing Uber most definitely does right, however, is its unique value proposition.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-uber.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Uber\" width=\"1068\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Uber&#8217;s value proposition, offering uber convenience<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Without explicitly saying so, Uber expertly highlights everything that sucks about taking a traditional taxi and points out how its service is superior. The simple (yet highly effective) copy above, taken from the Uber homepage, excellently conveys the simplicity and ease that lies at the heart of what makes it such a tempting service:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One tap and a car comes directly to you<\/li>\n<li>Your driver knows exactly where to go<\/li>\n<li>Payment is completely cashless<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Everything about this directly contrasts the typical experience of getting a taxi \u2013 no phone calls to disinterested dispatchers, no painful conversations trying to explain to a stressed-out cabbie about where you need to be, and no fumbling for change or worrying you\u2019ve got enough bills in your wallet. Just a fast, efficient way to get where you\u2019re going. This is reinforced by the aspirational <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">messaging<\/a> toward the top of the Uber homepage, which states that \u201cYour day belongs to you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At this point, it\u2019s worth comparing Uber\u2019s value proposition with that of rival company Lyft. The two companies\u2019 offerings are virtually identical, which is what makes a direct comparison of the two so interesting. Take a look at this information from the Lyft homepage:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-lyft1-1.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Lyft\" width=\"950\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lyft&#8217;s step-by-step value proposition<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Structurally and thematically, Lyft\u2019s homepage is very similar to Uber\u2019s. However, there\u2019s some key differences here that highlight how Uber\u2019s value proposition is more clearly positioned.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, Lyft does score some points for including several step-by-step images of the Lyft experience, helping visitors visualize what taking a ride with Lyft is like. However, look at the copy for the first step of the process. It lists the three tiers of Lyft service \u2013 Lyft, Lyft Line, and Lyft Plus \u2013 but doesn\u2019t explain the difference between these service tiers, or tell the prospect why they should choose between them.<\/p>\n<p>Also, while clearly explaining the final stage of the process \u2013 paying and rating the driver \u2013 this information implies that there is a final definitive action required by the user, something Uber does not. Personally, I almost always try to rate my Uber drivers (bearing in mind the oft-speculated \u201csecret\u201d rating of around 4.6 out of 5 that many believe serves as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2015\/01\/27\/the-mysterious-way-uber-bans-drivers.html\">the performance benchmark for Uber drivers<\/a>), but I don\u2019t <em>have<\/em> to. Sometimes I\u2019ll forget about it and just get on with my day \u2013 it certainly isn\u2019t required, and nor is manually paying my driver. For a service built on the notion of efficiency and convenience, this is a big deal.<\/p>\n<p>Now, one could argue that Lyft does a better job of being transparent about what users can expect, an argument that definitely has merit, especially if you\u2019ve ever been stung by Uber\u2019s unexpected \u201csurge\u201d pricing. However, for two such similar services, I\u2019d argue that Uber\u2019s value proposition is more clearly positioned, and certainly more persuasive than that of Lyft \u2013 an important distinction if you\u2019re operating in a crowded market with several similar competitors.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong><\/strong><strong>Free download &gt;&gt; <\/strong>Master Google Ads with our <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\"><strong>free PPC 101<\/strong><\/a> guide.<\/p>\n<div id=\"apple-value-proposition-example\"><\/div>\n<h2>2. Apple iPhone \u2013 The Experience IS the Product<\/h2>\n<p>Even in today\u2019s oversaturated consumer electronics marketplace, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more iconic product than the Apple iPhone. It\u2019s also difficult to imagine a product with as much competition as Apple\u2019s flagship mobile device, so what sets the iPhone apart from the (literally) hundreds of competing devices on the market?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-iphone.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples iPhone\" width=\"735\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Apple&#8217;s iPhone value proposition, offering unique experience<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019d probably expect from Apple, a firm renowned as much for its commitment to sleek, elegant product design as its actual products, Apple firmly reiterates its value proposition in the copy about its iPhone range of products \u2013 specifically, the design of the device itself, the ease of use that has been a cornerstone of Apple\u2019s design aesthetic since the launch of OS X, and the aspirational qualities that an iPhone supposedly offers the user.<\/p>\n<p>This aspirational messaging <em>is<\/em> Apple\u2019s value proposition (and a key component of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examplesundefined\">positioning statement<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the copy. Apple states that it believes a phone \u201cshould be more than a collection of features\u201d \u2013 yet this is precisely what a smartphone is. We could sit here and poke fun at Apple\u2019s lofty design aesthetic for days (the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/freejonyive\">#freejonyive hashtag on Twitter<\/a>, which jokes that Apple\u2019s lead designer has been trapped in a white room for several years, is a prime example), but it\u2019s a remarkably effective approach that has helped Apple remain at the forefront of a brutally competitive market for almost a decade.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-free-jony-ive.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Free Jony Ive #freejonyive\" width=\"523\" height=\"305\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Jony Ive (#freejonyive)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Apple knows how crowded and competitive the smart device market is, so rather than focus on a specific feature \u2013 virtually none of which are unique to the iPhone or iOS \u2013 the company instead opts to focus on the experience of using an iPhone. Most companies couldn\u2019t pull off using words such as \u201cmagical\u201d to describe using a smartphone, but Apple can.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Apple doesn\u2019t just sit on its proverbial laurels and rely on aspirational messaging to sell you on its value proposition. The official iPhone site also touches on several of the genuinely unique features of iPhone and iOS to make its case, including security:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-iphone-security.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples iPhone security features\" width=\"824\" height=\"485\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Apple iPhone value<\/em> <em>proposition, focusing on security<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not only is this a very clever move on Apple\u2019s part (especially in the wake of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/04\/21\/475175256\/fbi-paid-more-than-1-million-to-access-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone\">the disastrous FBI San Bernardino iPhone unlocking lawsuit<\/a>), but the copy matches the rest of Apple\u2019s messaging perfectly and manages to simplify an incredibly complex topic \u2013 encryption \u2013 into easily understandable language that most users can grasp and feel good about.<\/p>\n<p>Apple understands that even focusing on the unique features of iPhone wouldn\u2019t be enough to distinguish the device in such a crowded market.

The copy also clearly states that Unbounce is primarily aimed at marketers (a clear indication of understanding and appealing to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">a highly specific target audience<\/a>), as well as the fact that users can create mobile-responsive landing pages, which itself addresses a very specific need or concern for some marketers.<\/p>\n<p>Great stuff all around.<\/p>\n<div id=\"slack-value-proposition-example\"><\/div>\n<h2>4. Slack \u2013 Be More Productive at Work with Less Effort<\/h2>\n<p>The world seems to be divided into two types of people; those who love Slack, and those who haven\u2019t tried it yet. For the uninitiated, Slack is a workplace productivity and messaging app. It\u2019s deceptively simple to use, yet robust enough for large teams working on complex projects (as evidenced by Slack\u2019s very clever inclusion of the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab example on the homepage), so what sets Slack apart from the thousands of other messaging and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/26\/productivity-tools\">productivity apps<\/a>?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-slack.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Slack\" width=\"617\" height=\"272\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Slack&#8217;s value proposition, focusing on credibility and productivity<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, Slack distills its value proposition in the example above \u2013 it makes users\u2019 \u201cworking lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.\u201d The NASA JPL example is also very clever in that it subtly implies that if it\u2019s good enough for large teams of scientists at NASA \u2013 the kind of people who put robots on other planets \u2013 then it\u2019s good enough for anyone.<\/p>\n<p>However, while this might seem like the value prop of virtually every productivity app on the market, Slack has several advantages that support its core value prop of making collaboration simpler.<\/p>\n<p>For one, few (if any) other productivity apps boast as many integrations as Slack does. This means that its almost guaranteed to fit into just about any company\u2019s existing communications workflow. It\u2019s this diversity of supported apps that has helped Slack almost singlehandedly dominate the workplace productivity space.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-slack-2.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Slack\" width=\"1006\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;Slack: All your tools in one place.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Simplicity is also a core theme at the heart of Slack\u2019s value proposition. After all, it\u2019s hard to get more done if the app that promises to help you do that is a pain in the ass to use. The premise of \u201cfind anything, anywhere, anytime, from any device\u201d is another selling point Slack users routinely evangelize about, and for good reason.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-slack-3.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Slack\" width=\"1004\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;Slack: Search your entire archive.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I won\u2019t dissect every aspect of Slack, but suffice to say that the messaging and positioning of Slack essentially addresses every common <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a> you can think of about collaborating with others at work, then simplifies it in an almost irresistible way. To newcomers, it may even seem too good to be true, which is arguably why Slack has become so insanely popular (and helped the company achieve <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/01\/slack-raises-200-million-at-3-8-billion-valuation\/\">a breathtaking $3.8 billion valuation<\/a>).

Digit \u2013 Save Money Without Thinking About It<\/h2>\n<p>The world of personal finance is another ruthlessly competitive space, and there are tens of thousands of apps designed to help people manage their money more effectively. However, few have as good a value proposition as Digit, a relatively new service that helps users \u201csave money, without thinking about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-proposition-examples-digit.png\" alt=\"Value proposition examples Digit\" width=\"896\" height=\"602\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Digit&#8217;s value proposition, offering hands-off savings<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Digit allows users to securely connect their bank accounts to the Digit service, which then algorithmically examines users\u2019 spending habits and regular expenses.
