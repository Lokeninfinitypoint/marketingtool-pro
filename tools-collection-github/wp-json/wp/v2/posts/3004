In Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords), this is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/dayparting\">dayparting<\/a> (not to be mistaken with day <em>partying<\/em>) or ad scheduling.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong> \ud83d\udcd7 Free guide <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">&gt;&gt; PPC 101: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC<\/a><\/strong><\/div><\/div>\n<p>This valuable setting is something I often bring up in conversation with my clients, although common objections include: But why is this necessary? Isn\u2019t it best to distribute your ads evenly? Doesn\u2019t the time of day (or day of week) someone could potentially convert often fluctuate? What if I miss out on potential business by excluding certain hours of the day?<\/p>\n<p>I understand all of these objections, and indeed dayparting is not for everyone, but if implemented and monitored correctly it can work wonders on your account. As stated by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ppchero.com\/maximize-efficiency-with-dayparting-in-small-accounts\/\">PPC Hero\u2019s<\/a> <a href=\"mailto:https:\/\/twitter.com\/ecouch11\">Eric Couch<\/a>, \u201cWorking in PPC is all about making the most of what you have \u2026 the stakes may be lower when you\u2019re only spending fifteen dollars a day, but that doesn\u2019t make it less important to perform at a high level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Think about it: Maybe you operate a ski &amp; snowboard rental shop. You might find that desktop and tablet searches spike on Thursday and Friday nights between the hours of 8:00PM and 12:00PM when skiers are researching in preparation for their ski weekend. You might also see <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/18\/mobile-ppc-ads\">mobile searches<\/a> increase during weekends and weekday vacation mornings from 6:00AM to 10:00AM. In these scenarios you\u2019ll likely want to re-allocate your budget in order to <strong>get more visibility during peak hours<\/strong>. This will lead to more rentals and money for your business, bringing you a step closer to buying that shiny boat you\u2019ve had your eye on.<\/p>\n<p>The scenario above might not be as clear for your business. Perhaps you operate a SaaS company, in which case the hours and days of the week that are most profitable are harder to predict. Luckily, the Google Ads\u00a0Dimensions tab was invented to solve these problems. So let\u2019s put an end to advertising during unprofitable times and start spending your money in a wiser manner.<\/p>\n<p>In this article I\u2019ll:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explain how to use the Dimensions tab<\/strong> to set up ad scheduling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share some data<\/strong> on which times and days tend to show the best PPC performance across different industries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>5 Steps to Setting Up Google Ads\u00a0Scheduling<\/h2>\n<p><em>For more recent ad scheduling tips, check out our latest:\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/13\/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling\">How to Set Up Ad Scheduling RIGHT (+ the Finer Details You Need to Know)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Follow these five easy steps to scheduling your Google\u00a0ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1<\/h3>\n<p>Before creating an ad schedule or excluding days of the week, jump into the Dimensions tab within the campaign you want to focus on (you can also look across the entire account, for example if your account only has one or two campaigns of similar focus).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-dimensions-tab-step-1-1.png\" alt=\"using the adwords dimensions tab\" width=\"598\" height=\"210\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step 2<\/h3>\n<p>Once in the Dimensions tab navigate over to the \u201cView\u201d drop-down and scroll down to \u201cTime.\u201d Here you\u2019ll be able to select from the following seven options available, but I\u2019d recommend keeping your focus on \u201cDay of the week\u201d and \u201cHour of the day.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dimensions-tab-select-day-of-week-1.png\" alt=\"dayparting in google\" width=\"302\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step 3<\/h3>\n<p>Analyze what days and times of the day are most profitable or performing most optimally in terms of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/25\/ppc-plan\">PPC goals<\/a>. Make sure the amount of time you are looking over is statistically significant. Creating an ad schedule based off of a random pattern that isn\u2019t likely to repeat can be detrimental to your account.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-scheduling-data-1.png\" alt=\"ad sheduling tips\" width=\"692\" height=\"366\" \/><\/div>\n<p>According to WordStream Paid Search Strategist Mark Irvine, \u201cOccasionally I hear a client or account manager insist that some odd day of the week or hours of the day kill it for their account. Unless they have some explanation for why this might be I typically find their data doesn\u2019t support their belief.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have done some analysis it is time to create a unique ad schedule for your campaign. To do so, navigate to the \u201cSettings\u201d tab within the campaign you\u2019re adjusting, then select \u201cAd Schedule.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-settings-ad-scheduling-1.png\" alt=\"ad schedule settings\" width=\"639\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step 5<\/h3>\n<p>Scroll down and select the red \u201c+ AD SCHEDULE\u201d button to choose the days of the weeks, hours of the day, etc. that you would like to show your ads. Once you\u2019ve created your ad schedule you can also use the \u201cSet <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/09\/combined-bid-adjustments\">bid adjustments<\/a>\u201d to bid higher or lower on certain hours or day or days of the week which are higher or lower in value.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-adwords-ad-schedule-button-1.png\" alt=\"ad schedule\" width=\"253\" height=\"151\" \/><\/div>\n<p>With ad scheduling I would recommend starting with a trial period. Don\u2019t just set it and forget it. Keep track of when you made the adjustments, let your account run on the new schedule, and check in on a monthly basis to compare to past performance, keeping in mind monthly and seasonal fluctuations.<\/p>\n<h2>Ad Scheduling Trends and Data<\/h2>\n<p>At WordStream we\u2019ve seen some common trends for certain industries when it comes to peak performance in regards to CPA (<a href=\"\/cost-per-action\">cost-per-acquisition<\/a>). For example, DIY and home improvement industries tend to do well on weekends. In contrast, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/18\/b2b-ppc-guide\">B2B companies<\/a> tend to do well Monday through Friday between 9:00AM to 5:00PM, with very poor performance outside of these business hours.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this B2B client data displayed as a line graph and heat map, which clearly demonstrates a <strong>significantly lower CPA Monday through Friday<\/strong> during the hours of around 7:00AM until 4:00PM.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-scheduling-data-b2b-1.png\" alt=\"Ad scheduling data B2B ecommerce\" width=\"697\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>B2B CPA is lower during standard business hours<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-dayparting-data-b2b-2-1.png\" alt=\"b2b dayparting data\" width=\"490\" height=\"517\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The red zones represent high CPA for this B2B client<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are industries that are less likely to find dayparting valuable; for example, <strong>consumer shopping clients typically experience symmetrical performance during all hours of the day<\/strong>. Below is an example of B2C client, which displays no real actionable trend that would lead to use for a customized ad schedule.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dayparting-for-e-commerce-data-1.png\" alt=\"b2c ad scheduling data\" width=\"767\" height=\"335\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>This B2C account has a flat CPA throughout the day<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-scheduling-e-commerce-heatmap-1.png\" alt=\"b2c ad scheduling\" width=\"490\" height=\"517\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>No patterns in day of week or time of day for CPA<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This data proves that ad scheduling is not for everyone, but for those who see strong data trends during certain hours or days of the week (like the B2B example above), using dayparting can add significant value to your Google Ads performance and lead to a much higher ROI on your Google Ads\u00a0spend.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve reviewed the basics of dayparting, take the following steps on your Google Ads\u00a0account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reflect<\/strong> \u2013 Ask yourself if you have noticed any trends in performance. For example do you tend to get a lot more form fill-outs or <a href=\"\/call-tracking\">phone calls<\/a> to your business during peak hours, workdays, or weekends?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Research <\/strong>\u2013 Dig into the Google Ads\u00a0Dimensions tab starting with your most profitable campaign. Segment by time of day and day of week, making sure to look over a statistically significant period of time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Re-adjust<\/strong> \u2013 If (and only if) a common trend is made very clear through your research (for example if you\u2019re seeing a much lower CPA from 3PM to 11PM on weekends) then create an ad schedule to focus on your top performing times and\/or days of the week.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Revisit<\/strong> \u2013 Take note of when your ad schedule was implemented and revisit your campaign performance in terms of your most important metrics to see how results have changed (and hopefully improved).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Have you tried ad scheduling in the past? If yes, have you seen success (or failure)? Do you see any interesting dayparting trends within your particular industry?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Odds are, your AdWords campaigns don\u2019t need to be running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which can eat through your budget.
