Find a writing partner<\/h3>\n<p>If you work at a reasonably sized company, the chances are pretty good that there is at least one other person who is also wondering how to become a\u00a0better writer. Although writing is typically considered a solitary activity, the best writers know when it\u2019s time to get much-needed feedback on their work.<\/p>\n<p>Talk to your coworkers (or friends) and ask someone if they\u2019d be willing to cast an eye over your work \u2013 they may spot mistakes that you overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a writing partner is also a great way to hold yourself accountable and keep going.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Join a workshop or take a night class<\/h3>\n<p>Most people balk at the idea of standing in front of a room full of strangers and baring their soul to the world, but joining a writing workshop can be immensely beneficial \u2013 and a lot of fun (if you manage to find a good one).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-writing-workshop-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills writing workshop\" width=\"540\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to have an unfinished novel hidden away in your desk drawer to join a workshop.

Pick a topic, write something, listen to the feedback of the group, and then revise it. Rinse, repeat.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Dissect writing that you admire<\/h3>\n<p>Most people read the same blogs or sites on a regular basis because the material appeals to them \u2013 but fewer people understand why their favorite blogs are so appealing.<\/p>\n<p>Find a handful of recent blog posts you really like, then print them out. Next, just like your high school English teacher did, take a red pen and highlight things you liked: certain sentences, turns of phrase, even entire paragraphs. Examine why you like these elements, and see if there are any common threads in your favored reading material. See how writers take one subject and transition into another. Apply these techniques to your own work.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at a particularly powerful (and memorable piece) from Copyblogger that serves as a great example of this.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-copyblogger-post-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills copyblogger example\" width=\"666\" height=\"604\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-copyblogger-post-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills copyblogger example 2\" width=\"664\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Immediately, you\u2019re hooked by Morris\u2019 opening.

Imitate writers you admire<\/h3>\n<p>Before we go any further, a disclaimer \u2013 imitation is <strong>not<\/strong> the same as plagiarism. Don\u2019t rip off anyone\u2019s work. Ever.<\/p>\n<p>Just as you probably have a list of blogs you read often, you\u2019ll likely also read the same writers on a regular basis. Identify what it is you enjoy about their work, and see if you can use it to improve your writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">skills<\/a>. Does a writer you like use humor to spice up dry topics? Try it. Do they use pop culture references to make their work entertaining <em>and<\/em> useful? Try that, too.<\/p>\n<p>When I first started writing, I imitated some of my favorite nonfiction writers and essayists, such as Joan Didion, Truman Capote and Bill Bryson. I also attempted (and failed) to imitate writers such as Dave Eggers and Dan Kennedy, but soon realized that I wasn&#8217;t funny enough and gave it up. Over time, I eventually developed my own style, but reading the works of these writers and seeing how they constructed their essays and books was immensely helpful to me as a writer (see tip #3).<\/p>\n<h3>8. Remember that outlines are your friend<\/h3>\n<p>The blinking cursor of a blank page is a considerable foe, even for the most experienced writers. Before putting pen to proverbial paper, sketch out an outline of what you plan to write. This will be your battle plan, and it will help you win the war. Very few \u2013 and I do mean <em>very<\/em> few \u2013 writers sit down to write anything without a solid plan in mind.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-outline-post-its-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills outlining with post its\" width=\"425\" height=\"282\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>An outline doesn\u2019t have to be complex. A simple framework of which sections should appear in a particular order, along with a few sentences about what each section contains, may be enough. If the topic you\u2019re tackling is a little more complex, your outline might have to be, too \u2013 but having an outline before you write is like having a roadmap in the glove box of your car before a road trip. If you start to feel lost, refer back to your outline and get back to kicking ass and taking names.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at a real example \u2013 one of my own outlines:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Introduction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Brief summary of the post<\/p>\n<p><strong>Section 1 \u2013 What is Brand Voice?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Paragraph(s) explaining the key principles behind brand voice (style, tone, and messaging)<\/p>\n<p>Examples of each<\/p>\n<p><strong>Section 2 \u2013 Developing Brand Voice with Content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Explanations of how to develop brand voice using content (written, visual, video)<\/p>\n<p>Considerations for content producers\/marketers to bear in mind when producing content (strategy, goals, overall brand messaging)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Section 3 \u2013 Examples of Content That Builds Brand Voice<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Several examples (three or four) of content that aligns well with marketing positioning and branding of recognizable brands<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wrap-up<\/p>\n<p>This outline eventually became my recent post about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>. I deviated from my initial outline slightly, but the overarching structure was always there to keep me on target.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Edit your work ruthlessly<\/h3>\n<p>So, you\u2019re writing every day (or regularly, at least), and you\u2019re feeling more confident about your work. Awesome! Now you\u2019re going to become your own harshest critic.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-red-pen-edit-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills editing process\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/23\/self-editing-tips\">Editing<\/a> is a tough skill to learn for beginner writers, because they place immense value on the time and effort they put into writing in the first place.

Accept that first drafts are almost always crap<\/h3>\n<p>The best writers make it look so easy. After reading a great post, it\u2019s tempting to imagine your favorite bloggers effortlessly turning in incredible posts with minimal effort before spending the rest of their day reading obscure books in a quaint corner caf\u00e9 somewhere. Take comfort in the knowledge that this isn\u2019t how writing works.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-first-drafts-are-crap-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills first drafts are crap\" width=\"644\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>First drafts are almost always crap, and that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you don\u2019t create a masterpiece on your first attempt \u2013 chances are, you probably won\u2019t, and that\u2019s okay, too. Just get your ideas down on paper first, then go back and start cleaning up. Writing is an iterative process, and even the best writers have to spend a <strong>lot<\/strong> of time reworking material they were probably too embarrassed to show anybody.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Find a good (patient) editor<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re trying to make the case for a content strategy to your manager or want to start <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/20\/guest-blogging\">guest blogging<\/a> on your favorite sites, finding and working with a good editor is one of the best things you can do to improve your writing skills. I\u2019ve worked with dozens of editors over the years, and in my experience, the best are those who show you <em>why<\/em> something doesn\u2019t work, rather than just telling you that it doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-everyone-needs-a-good-editor-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills everyone needs a good editor\" width=\"555\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Allowing someone else to read your work can be brutally difficult for some writers, especially when they\u2019re just starting out, but it\u2019s crucial that you develop good habits from the outset and learn to accept constructive criticism about your work. Remember \u2013 writers are desperately needy creatures who need to be constantly reassured that they\u2019re the creative geniuses they believe themselves to be, but you\u2019ll need to develop a thick skin if you\u2019re serious about your work, and a good editor is invaluable when it comes to toughening up.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Eliminate unnecessary words<\/h3>\n<p>Another common mistake among beginner writers (and some more experienced writers who should know better) is writing overly complex sentences in an attempt to \u201csound\u201d more authoritative.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, shorter sentences can have a greater impact. You may have heard of a six-word story that was supposedly written by Ernest Hemingway, which reads, \u201cFor sale: Baby shoes, never worn.\u201d Whether Hemingway wrote this or not is irrelevant \u2013 the power of these six words shows that brevity can be a powerful tool when used correctly, and not every sentence needs to be overwrought to get your point across.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-baby-shoes-never-worn-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills baby shoes never worn\" width=\"610\" height=\"324\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at another real example from one of my posts \u2013 my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">very first post<\/a> for WordStream, as it happens.

Take a stroll down memory lane<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve been writing professionally, in one way or another, for the past ten years. When I look back at my early work, which I do every so often, it literally makes me cringe. I don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m a masochist, but to remind myself how far I\u2019ve come.<\/p>\n<p>Writing should be fun, and along with the thrill of seeing your byline for the first time, seeing how far you\u2019ve progressed is one of the most satisfying parts of being a writer. Every now and then (but not too often), re-read your earlier work and marvel at how much better you are now than you were then. Pat yourself on the back. You\u2019ve worked hard, so don\u2019t be shy \u2013 congratulate yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Don\u2019t be afraid to say what you think<\/h3>\n<p>Most content on the web is bland and dreadfully boring. This is because far too many bloggers focus on regurgitating the same news as everybody else without bothering to add their own opinions. Obviously you don\u2019t want to fall afoul of libel laws, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) say what you think.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-speak-your-mind-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve your writing skills speak your mind\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve started to discover your own \u201cvoice,\u201d don\u2019t be shy about sharing your opinions. This makes for more interesting reading. Don\u2019t be <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">contrarian<\/a> for its own sake, and don\u2019t set out to purposefully piss anyone off, but make sure there\u2019s enough of you in your writing to make it a worthwhile read for your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Do your research<\/h3>\n<p>Aside from plagiarizing someone else\u2019s work, nothing will undermine your credibility faster than failing to do your homework.<\/p>\n<p>In their eagerness to be done with a blog post (or even major newspaper article), many writers try to take shortcuts with the facts. This can range from accidentally fudging a statistic out of haste to being lazy when it comes to sourcing or attribution. Not only can this land you in big trouble with your editor\/content marketing manager\/other boss-type person, it also makes you look like an amateur.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-my-writing-skills-do-your-research-1.jpg\" alt=\"Improve my writing skills do your research\" width=\"849\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Everybody makes mistakes, and you don\u2019t need to spend weeks cross-referencing every last statistic (see the next tip), but common sense should prevail here \u2013 don\u2019t rely exclusively on sites like Wikipedia, and use current, primary sources whenever possible.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Remember done is better than perfect<\/h3>\n<p>You should definitely take the time to write as well as you can, proofread and edit your work thoroughly, and ensure that your piece flows logically from one point to the next.<\/p>\n<p>However, this doesn\u2019t mean you should take weeks to write something.<\/p>\n<p>No piece of writing will ever be perfect \u2013 you have to know when it\u2019s time to let it go. This is especially important in content marketing, because you\u2019ll rarely (if ever) have the luxury of crafting agonizingly beautiful blog posts full of poignant sentences and evocative imagery. As you become more confident, the \u201cwriting\u201d part of writing will become easier and faster, but never lose sight of the fact that deadlines, or editorial calendars, are just as much your masters as any boss or manager.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I\u2019m going to take my own advice and call this post done. I hope you find these tips useful, no matter how long you\u2019ve been writing.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-improve-your-writing-skills\"><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#how-to-improve-your-writing-skills\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Summary: how to improve your writing skills<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>To recap, here are all the ways you could improve your writing skills:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brush up on the basic principles of writing, grammar and spelling.<\/li>\n<li>Write like it\u2019s your job and practice regularly.<\/li>\n<li>Read more so you develop an eye for what effective writing looks like.<\/li>\n<li>Find a partner.
