This month, Google and\u00a0Bing rolled\u00a0In-Market Audiences for Search out to all US advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>In-Market Audiences for Search should feel like In-Market targeting for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">GDN advertisers<\/a> or Facebook advertisers\u2019 in-market targeting. They allow you to find users whose past search and browsing behaviors indicate that they\u2019re more likely actively searching for your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>Much like RLSA audiences and similar audiences for search, these audiences are generally more qualified than those found on standard search; they&#8217;re\u00a0closer to making a purchasing decision, rather than just beginning to research or consider your brand. But <em>unlike <\/em>remarketing audiences, In-Market audiences for search may have never heard of your brand or been to your site before, making them the perfect people to introduce yourself to.<\/p>\n<h2>In-Market Audiences for Search In Action<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re advertising on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keyword<\/a> \u201cNew York Hotel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019d likely be serving your ad to the tens of thousands of people who search for hotels every day. Thousands of them may just be browsing or beginning to plan their summer vacations but have no intention of booking a room today. But a few have done their research online over the past few weeks, booked their flights, and are ready to book their getaway.<\/p>\n<p>Although <em>their <\/em>search for \u201cNew York Hotels\u201d looks no different from the hordes of less-qualified people on the same keyword, it\u2019s easy for the search engines to see that they\u2019re in-market for accommodations in New York, just based on their past search and browsing history.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"824a3c5a-3065-4964-95d2-6e8a0c0ac5c4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/in-market-audiences-for-search-ads-example-hotel_0.png\" alt=\"in market audiences for search ads hotel example\" width=\"800\" height=\"409\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This gives you a distinct advantage, allowing you to bid up or reserve your budget exclusively for searches from people who are in &#8220;buy-now&#8221; mode.<\/p>\n<h2>What Will In-Market Audiences for Search Look Like?<\/h2>\n<p>The initial release of In-Market Audiences includes <a href=\"http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink?LinkId=872520\">over 170 unique In-Market audiences<\/a> to target from popular industries. There\u2019s opportunity for just about every industry to take advantage of, including Auto, Travel, Legal, Finance, Real Estate, Business services, Education, and more! <strong>Both Google and Bing are expected to continuously expand these audiences over time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Early beta tests targeting In-Market Audiences reveal its strong potential to change your search campaign performance. These carefully curated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-distribution\">search audiences<\/a> targeted a smaller share of the people searching for their keywords, but these audiences were <strong>162% more likely to click through<\/strong> on a relevant search ad and <strong>more than twice as likely to convert<\/strong> on the same ads!<\/p>\n<p>Further, at no additional cost to reach these audiences, advertisers were able to refine the targeting of their search campaigns and reduce their CPA by more than half on average!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7dad6ad1-e5cb-4508-8b2b-a71d0764e782\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/the-impact-of-in-market-audiences-for-search-ads.png\" alt=\"the impact of in market audiences for search\" width=\"800\" height=\"485\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Of course, these In-Market Audiences will have limited reach on the SERP, even for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">popular industries<\/a> and <a href=\"\/popular-keywords\">keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On average, we\u2019ve seen that only about 5% of searchers are identified as \u201cIn-Market\u201d at any given time. Although many advertisers saw up to half of their conversions coming from these highly qualified In-Market Audiences, their limited reach should be carefully considered as you work them into your campaign strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Best Practices for Using In-Market Audiences for Search Campaigns<\/h2>\n<h3>Try bid-only (or &#8220;observe&#8221;) targeting first<\/h3>\n<p>New features are always exciting and In-Market Audiences will certainly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">improve your search campaigns<\/a>, but it\u2019s best to start small at first! Add In-Market audiences to your existing campaigns as a \u201cBid only\u201d (\u201cObserve\u201d within AdWords) target with a modest bid adjustment to begin.<\/p>\n<p>Over a few weeks, not only will you see your campaigns perform better, but you\u2019ll also collect valuable data to guide your next moves. If you see similar audiences perform well and attract a large audience, then you may want to create a separate campaign targeting these users with a \u201cTarget and Bid\u201d \u00a0(\u201cTarget\u201d within AdWords) target. If you\u2019re skeptical or want to be especially cautious, this data comes for free by using a \u201cBid only\u201d target by applying a +0% bid adjustment.<\/p>\n<h3>Test out multiple In-Market Audiences (even the non-obvious ones)<\/h3>\n<p>Some targets will naturally make sense for your brand. Sure, a hotel has a lot to gain by targeting someone who\u2019s In-Market for travel. But a savvy luggage retailer could potentially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/30\/cross-selling-upselling\">cross-sell their product<\/a> to these audience looking to get away.\u00a0Conversely, a B2B service may be smart to exclude or reduce their bids for this audience of searchers whose wanderlust may keep them from converting!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9d15cd83-fd0e-491b-bfcb-052dd401f291\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-adwords-in-market-audiences-search-network.png\" alt=\"google adwords in market audiences for search\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Layer In-Market Audiences with other demographics and audiences<\/h3>\n<p>As powerful as In-Market Audiences are, don\u2019t use them as your only signal to determine your qualified searchers.
