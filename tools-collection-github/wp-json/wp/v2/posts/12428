Instagram carousel ads also allow the advertisers to add in clickable calls to action, change the text below for each image, and link to various web pages. They are perfect for any industry that has beautiful imagery and is looking to show different angles or multiple related products in one advertisement.<\/p>\n<p>Why are Instagram carousel ads so wonderful?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWith more creative space within an ad, you can highlight different products, showcase specific details about one produce, service or promotion, or tell a story about your brand that develops across each carousel card,\u201d says Instagram\u2019s parent company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads-guide\/carousel\/instagram-feed\/traffic\">Facebook<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Instagram carousel ad guidelines<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you understand what these ads are, it is critical to be aware of the guidelines around crafting your ad to ensure it won\u2019t get rejected by the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind regarding the design and technical requirements before crafting your ad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum number of photos\/videos: 10<\/li>\n<li>Minimum number of photos\/videos: 2<\/li>\n<li>Image file formats: jpg and png<\/li>\n<li>Maximum video size\/length: 4GB for up to 60 seconds<\/li>\n<li>Text in images: 20% or less of image<\/li>\n<li>Text below image: \u22642,200 in up to 2 rows of text<\/li>\n<li>Maximum hashtags in text: 30<\/li>\n<li>Supported objectives: Reach, Conversions, Traffic, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, Catalog Sales, Store Traffic, App Installs, Messages<\/li>\n<li>Supported CTA buttons: Shop Now, Book Now, Learn More, Get Showtimes, Sign Up, Download, Watch More, Contract Us, Apply Now, Donate Now, Get Quote, Request Time, See Menu, Send Message, Listen Now, Get Offer, Subscribe, Book Test Drive, Check Availability<\/li>\n<li>Ad Placement Options: Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6 ways to win at Instagram carousel ads<\/h2>\n<p>Those design and technical requirements will make sure your ads are approved by the platform\u2014but, as an advertiser, you know that doesn\u2019t mean your done with ad strategy. Now, let\u2019s dive into the fun stuff to make sure your Instagram carousel ads are successful! Here are <strong>six strategies to make some crush-worthy Instagram carousel ads.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>1. Target each unique audience strategically<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone who has advertised on Facebook and Instagram knows how ridiculously amazing their targeting is. Whether you are targeting a soccer mom who lives on the Maine coast and enjoys reading fiction novels and eating seafood or a teenager in Texas with a passion for online furniture shopping, you can get in front of your audience. You can get as detailed as your heart desires, but please just do not get lazy.<\/p>\n<p>Use Instagram\u2019s robust targeting options to segment your audiences and target them with carousel ads that fit their unique needs, wants, and stage in your buying cycle. Breaking up each unique audience for your various campaigns will ensure you are spending your budget as wisely as possible. Considering how many people are on Instagram this tip is especially important for Instagram carousel ads\u2014since these babies take time and money to put together, making sure you are showing them to the right people at the right time is key.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Prioritize copy just as much as imagery<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is all about the imagery, right? Well, yes, but when crafting an Instagram carousel ad, it is critical to put just as much thought into your copy. You\u2019re spending money to accomplish a set goal, so you need to use all the persuasive tools in your toolbox.<\/p>\n<p>Without context to go along with your imagery, it can be quite hard to communicate properly to visitors, so spend time on engaging, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/13\/persuasive-ads\">persuasive ad copy<\/a> that resides below your images. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/23\/instagram-captions\">Instagram captions<\/a> should be direct, actionable, and persuasive.<\/p>\n<p>Take the great example below from Budget Bytes. Image if you saw just the images of food and CTA saying, \u201cLearn More.\u201d You\u2019d be left dumbfounded thinking, <em>learn more about what?<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram carousel ad with bowl of food\" width=\"327\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Luckily, this company provided context to the images of food in the carousel ad. What I love about the copy included below is that it uses different fonts to put emphasis on different areas. This also uses checkbox emojis to clearly outline what the offer is. And there are little barriers to enter since the meal plan offered is free and provided within the CTA of the ad, as well as by the link at the end of the text.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-caption.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram carousel ad caption\" width=\"381\" height=\"258\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Don\u2019t feel the need to use all 10 image slots<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes less is more, my friends. Think about how much content is already on Instagram. Do you really think that every person who swipes through your ad is going to have the attention span to view all 10 images? Perhaps they will if you tell a compelling enough story, but if you\u2019re able to get you point across in just a couple quality images then why not go for it?<\/p>\n<p>Take this great example below from LL Bean. Rather than showing off their entire new line for 2020, LL Bean makes the point loud and clear with an initial picture, including a small amount of relevant text.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-llbean.jpg\" alt=\"LL Bean Instagram carousel ad\" width=\"260\" height=\"428\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And then the second image shows exactly where their store front location is to compel me to stop by.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-llbean-location.jpg\" alt=\"LL Bean Instagram carousel ad with map image\" width=\"262\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sometimes a simple and direct carousel ad is the most effective<\/p>\n<h3>4. Intrigue viewers with deals!<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it: Instagrammers are going to need an incentive to leave Instagram! The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/03\/social-media-networks\">social network<\/a> is like a blackhole. Who hasn\u2019t caught themselves going to bed an hour later because Instagram that has sucked you in? The platform can be very addictive! Therefore, to break the addiction and get your grammers to leave Instagram there needs to be some incentive\u2026<\/p>\n<p>What better way to incentivize Instagrammers to leave than a limited-time deal! Whether it\u2019s free shipping, a percentage discount, or a BOGO offer, carousel ads are great for these types of promotions. With this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/09\/instagram-marketing-strategy\">Instagram ad format<\/a>, you can promote multiple deals in one ad. Take the example below from the clothing brand, joie. The company uses the carousal ad format to show off the fabulous discounted clothing items offered as part of joie\u2019s winter sale.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-joie-deals.jpg\" alt=\"Joie Instagram carousel ad example\" width=\"324\" height=\"495\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>5. Choose your CTA carefully<\/h3>\n<p>With so many CTAs to choose from for the carousel ad format, it can feel a bit tempting to just pick the first one that makes some type of sense. Yet, this is not the best way to win folks over. Spend time really thinking about your offer and ensuring the CTA makes sense. There is nothing worse than clicking on a CTA and then feeling misled when the offer is different than expected (for instance, if you wanted to purchase something but were then led to an ebook landing page or vice versa).<\/p>\n<p>The Food Network\u2019s offer below is a great example of one well done. The ad uses the \u201cDownload\u201d CTA since the carousel images are showing various drool-worthy recipes from their downloadable app. The CTA perfectly aligns with the offer to download the app and sign up, and the text below the CTA further enforces it<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-food-network-cta.jpg\" alt=\"Food Network Instagram carousel ad example\" width=\"291\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>6. Don&#8217;t be afraid to incorporate video content<\/h3>\n<p>We all know how effective video ads are, but making a video Instagram carousel ad sounds like a LOT of hard and time-consuming work, doesn\u2019t it? It actually doesn\u2019t have to be!<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, our iPhones can take pretty quality videos so do not feel like you need to hire a fancy video production team to incorporate some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/28\/instagram-video-ads\">fun and interesting videos<\/a> into your carousel ads. Fitness mogul, Kayla Itsines, does a great job at making easy, quick, and low-production workout videos that she turns into Instagram carousel ads.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-carousel-ads-video.jpg\" alt=\"Example video Instagram carousel ad\" width=\"311\" height=\"588\" \/><\/div>\n<p>See, it\u2019s possible to create high-quality ads without being overly nit-picky on video production perfection.<\/p>\n<h2>Get rolling with Instagram carousel ads<\/h2>\n<p>Now, you\u2019ve got everything you need to get started making Instagram carousel ads and making sure they\u2019re super effective for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">Instagram marketing strategy<\/a>!
