But most advertisers rely on cost-per-click (CPC) bidding to hit their goals, so much so that we often refer to Google Ads\u00a0as a PPC, or pay-per-click, platform.<\/p>\n<p>However, as advertisers\u2019 accounts grow in size and complexity, it can be difficult to manage an ever-growing list of keywords, audiences, demographics, and bid adjustments in our campaigns. In 2010, Google introduced enhanced CPC (eCPC) bidding to ease some of the burden for busy advertisers, which allowed Google to dynamically adjust your bid within 30% if it believed a search was more likely to result in a conversion. Since then, eCPC bidding became the default bidding strategy for new campaigns, giving Google some level of control over many advertisers\u2019 bids.<\/p>\n<p>This Tuesday, <a href=\"http:\/\/googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com\/2017\/05\/adwords-improvements-for-enhanced-cpc.html\">Google announced a major change<\/a> to how it would handle these campaigns\u2019 bids \u2013 by allowing Google to automatically adjust your bid by more than 30%! Google details the full changes in its <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/2464964\">support page<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8ff26788-1063-498f-9046-d28999edc925\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/changes-to-enhanced-cpc-bidding1-1.png\" alt=\"changes to enhanced cpc bidding adwords 2017\" width=\"679\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Who\u2019s Affected by This Change?<\/h2>\n<p>Any advertiser who uses eCPC bidding is affected in this change. Given that this has been Google Ads\u2019 default bid strategy, that\u2019s a potentially startling number of advertisers! Especially considering that advertisers who use eCPC bidding still perform all the same tasks as those who use manual bidding, like adjusting keyword bids, many may be using eCPC bidding without even realizing it!<\/p>\n<p>To see your campaigns\u2019 bidding strategy, look under the settings tab:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c6cc39f6-9ff5-4404-9035-fb171ffe1640\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/enhanced-cpc-bidding-settings.jpg\" alt=\"enhanced cpc bidding in adwords\" width=\"1326\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What Should You Expect to See Change?<\/h2>\n<h3>Your average CPC<\/h3>\n<p>As part of this change, Google will have more control to bid up beyond the previous limit of 30% for searches it believes are more likely to convert. With this 30% cap removed, it\u2019s safe to assume that Google may be more aggressive in its automatic bid adjustments. Although it\u2019s possible for you to pay more than your maximum CPC for a single click in eCPC bidding, Google will still try to keep your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">average CPC<\/a> below your max CPC bid.<\/p>\n<h3>Your audience bids<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re still not adjusting your bids for your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/16\/rlsa-strategies\">remarketing<\/a> audiences, you\u2019re almost certainly missing out! Remarketing audiences are often much more than 30% more likely to convert on your site and many audiences can convert at 3x the rate of your new audiences.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f74ba9f6-2300-4616-9c84-2828c65b43a0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/engagement-vs-conversions.png\" alt=\"engaged audiences convert more\" width=\"1724\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In addition to your remarketing audiences, Google may also<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/12\/demographic-targeting-for-search-campaigns\"> adjust your bid for different demographics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/similar-audiences-for-search-campaigns\">similar audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Your bids for different locations<\/h3>\n<p>Google may anticipate that a user searching from Indiana may convert differently than one from India, even if they\u2019re searching for the same keyword. If Google notices a local market boasts particularly high conversion rates, its eCPC bidding will automatically<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/05\/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers\"> adjust you bids for that location.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Not Expect to See Change?<\/h2>\n<h3>Your CPA <em>(*Probably)<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>If you trust Google, rest easy: They don\u2019t anticipate this change should affect your campaign\u2019s CPA, even though your CPC may change. The expectation is Google will be bidding more exclusively for more qualified traffic that\u2019s more likely to convert on your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Your set maximum CPC bid<\/h3>\n<p>Although Google may be adjusting your actual bid in the <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google Ads\u00a0auction<\/a>, you will not see that change the bid you set in Google Ads. You can still increase your bids for high-performing keywords and segments or decrease your bids for poor-performing keywords and segments, and Google will aim to keep your average CPCs within your max bid.<\/p>\n<h3>Your device bids<\/h3>\n<p>Interesting, Google\u2019s eCPC does not take device into account when adjusting your bids. Advertisers should still review and set appropriate <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/device-level-bid-adjustments\">bid adjustments for mobile, tablet, and desktop<\/a> traffic based on the relative performance on each device.<\/p>\n<h2>What Should I Do About the New eCPC?<\/h2>\n<p>This change will be rolling out steadily over the month of June, and advertisers won\u2019t need to (or be able to) opt in or out. If you\u2019re currently using an enhanced CPC bidding strategy, keep a close eye on your campaigns\u2019 performance over the following weeks. It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll see your CPC rise, but you should also see your CVR and total conversions rise from your campaigns still maintaining your CPA. If that\u2019s true \u2013 Google\u2019s doing its job and enjoy the extra profit!<\/p>\n<p>You can continue to scale your success by regularly reviewing and adjusting your bids for different keywords, remarketing audiences, demographics, and devices.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not happy with the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/29\/adwords-ad-rotation-changes\">changes Google is looking to make<\/a> in your account, you can always switch to a manual CPC bidding strategy. Manual CPC bidding will give you complete control over every bid in your account. However, with great power comes great responsibility \u2013 manual CPC bidding can be particularly laborious some for many advertisers and if you don\u2019t regularly change your bids, don\u2019t expect performance to get better on its own!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has announced major changes to the way enhanced CPC bidding, or ECPC, works in AdWords.
