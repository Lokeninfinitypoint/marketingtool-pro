By focusing on a social or environmental cause, companies can connect more meaningfully with their audience and build stronger brand loyalty. But it\u2019s not as simple as selecting a cause and launching a campaign.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide to purpose-driven marketing, we\u2019ll explain the meaning and importance of purpose-driven marketing and then show some examples of brands that do it well.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-purpose-driven-marketing\">What is purpose-driven marketing?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#purpose-driven-marketing-vs-cause-marketing\">Purpose-driven marketing vs. cause marketing?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-use-purpose-driven-marketing-strategies\">Why use purpose-driven marketing strategies?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#7-meaningful-examples-of-purpose-driven-marketing\">7 meaningful examples of purpose-driven marketing<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-purpose-driven-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is purpose-driven marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Purpose-driven marketing is the strategy of aligning external communications, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand identity<\/a>, and marketing activities with a meaningful cause. The central cause could be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/28\/green-marketing\">environmental<\/a>, social, philanthropic, or economic, but it must be baked into the identity of the brand. Ideally, it\u2019s also integrated into the founding story and the central operations of the business.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warby Parker<\/a> is a great example. The direct-to-consumer glasses brand connects breaking up a monopoly on prescription glasses in the US with a critical global issue of access to both exams and eyewear with its core belief: \u201cWe believe everyone has the right to see.\u201d Through its non-profit partners, Warby Parker\u2019s philanthropic program donates a pair of glasses for each one sold. The company\u2019s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program has distributed more than 15 million pairs of glasses.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-glasses.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Warby Parker page.\" width=\"867\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87588 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-glasses.webp 867w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-glasses-480x254.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Your purpose is part of your value proposition.<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/resources\/how-to-create-a-unique-value-proposition-from-the-ground-up\/?cid=Web_LiQ_Any_InContent_Guide_ValueProposition_Download\">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a> to write the rest.<\/p>\n<div id=\"purpose-driven-marketing-vs-cause-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h2>Purpose-driven marketing vs. cause marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Corporate social responsibility has been in the news more regularly over the last several years. The 2016 election, the onset of the 2020 pandemic, and Gen-Z\u2019s aging into the workforce have motivated the trend. But not all marketing that relates to causes is purpose-driven marketing. Sometimes, it falls in the category of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/22\/cause-based-marketing\"> cause marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the key differences.<\/p>\n<h3>Duration<\/h3>\n<p>Plenty of companies run short-term marketing campaigns for socially responsible causes, whether it\u2019s connected to a specific time of year, product launch, or special initiative.<\/p>\n<p>Companies with purpose-driven marketing strategies have their support for these causes integrated into the business operations and values, so the commitment is longer-term.<\/p>\n<h3>Founding mission<\/h3>\n<p>With purpose-driven marketing, social responsibility is a part of the founding mission of the company.<\/p>\n<p>With cause marketing, companies partner with nonprofits, offer direct support, or call attention to an issue. This is great but not a core part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/23\/how-brand-your-business\">brand\u2019s identity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Business operations<\/h3>\n<p>Cause marketing doesn\u2019t always require business operations, but purpose-driven marketing does. Think Warby Parker\u2019s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. That scale and direction require operational support, including integration in any financial forecasting.<\/p>\n<p>Coca-Cola recently introduced plant-based bottles. While supporting the environment is an excellent cause, it\u2019s not a cornerstone of the brand\u2019s mission or identity, so it\u2019s not purpose-driven marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Coca-cola ad for plant-based bottled.\" width=\"848\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87589 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp 848w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola-480x242.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 848px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Free Guide!<\/strong> <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/resources\/guide-to-brand-awareness\/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_TextLink_BrandAwarenessGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">The Definitive Guide to Brand Awareness: Top Strategies, Examples &amp; How to Measure Success.<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-use-purpose-driven-marketing-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why use purpose-driven marketing strategies?<\/h2>\n<p>Purpose-driven marketing strategies can make a big difference in the world. But they also have benefits for businesses that practice them. They\u2019ll help win loyal customers, increase brand recognition, retain and engage employees, and even increase profits.<\/p>\n<h3>Winning loyal consumers<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a small business or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">managing the marketing<\/a> for one, you\u2019re thinking about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/25\/optimize-lead-generation-process\">customer acquisition<\/a>.

Throw in all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer mentions<\/a>, sponsored content, organic social media posts, and brand placement in shows and movies, and you can see how we\u2019re constantly taking in branding.<\/p>\n<p>In this environment, you want to give your small business every opportunity to stand out and find more ways to get your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand recognized<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Purpose-driven marketing creates a strong and memorable brand story, as the commitment to the cause is central to the company\u2019s origin. Stories are remembered up to <a href=\"https:\/\/womensleadership.stanford.edu\/node\/796\/harnessing-power-stories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">22 times<\/a> more than facts, helping your customers and potential customers remember your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Your brand is also more likely to get positive press mentions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0378426615001934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Research<\/a> shows that companies with stronger commitments to corporate social responsibility receive more press coverage overall and, in this coverage, are perceived more favorably.<\/p>\n<p>Aligning your business with a cause can help foster more passionate internal advocates, too. And this can impact your brand recognition and customer relationships. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.accenture.com\/news\/2018\/majority-of-consumers-buying-from-companies-that-take-a-stand-on-issues-they-care-about-and-ditching-those-that-dont-accenture-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65%<\/a> of consumers report that a brand\u2019s employees and its CEO can influence their purchases. This leads us right to the next benefit of purpose-driven marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>Attracting employees<\/h3>\n<p>The next major benefit of a purpose-driven marketing strategy is attracting, engaging, and retaining employees. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluebeyondconsulting.com\/blog\/what-do-employees-value-most\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> of employees consider working for a company with values that align with their own extremely important.<\/p>\n<p>People want to feel connected to the work they\u2019re doing, and this is becoming more true as Gen Z begins to make up a larger percentage of the workforce. <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/consumer-business\/welcome-to-gen-z.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deloitte<\/a> found that, compared to other generations, Gen Z is more concerned about a company\u2019s ethical standards and social impact.

If you\u2019re attracting passionate employees, your company needs to stay true to its core values in order to keep them engaged at work. And if you\u2019re able to keep your employees engaged, you\u2019ll see real, tangible benefits to your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Increasing profits<\/h3>\n<p>Employee engagement corresponds with productivity and presence, which translates to profitability for your business. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/236366\/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gallup<\/a> found that companies with engaged employees see a 17% increase in productivity and 41% less absenteeism. These same companies are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/236366\/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21%<\/a> more profitable on average.<\/p>\n<p>The potential increase in profits is also directly attributable to purpose-driven marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.babson.edu\/social-innovation-institute\/thought-leadership\/project-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project ROI <\/a>found that companies with strong commitments to social responsibility have a 6% higher market value and generate 20% more revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Those are some significant gains.<\/p>\n<div id=\"7-meaningful-examples-of-purpose-driven-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h2>7 meaningful examples of purpose-driven marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered purpose-driven marketing and why it\u2019s an effective business strategy, let\u2019s go over some effective examples from various businesses and marketing channels.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Lush: SEO copy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lush.com\/us\/en_us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lush<\/a> is a beauty and cosmetic company founded with clear intentions to use better ingredients and avoid animal testing. Now, the company hosts a competition for animal testing alternatives and has donated more than $2 million to this cause.<\/p>\n<p>This social responsibility is core to the brand, and they make sure to use that in their marketing. Take a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\">SEO copy<\/a> that appears on the Google search engine results page (SERP).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Lush search engine results.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87591 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The copy is informative. It\u2019s clear that the company offers hair care, skincare, and bath products. But the copy shares more without getting repetitive\u2014the ingredients are \u201cfresh,\u201d the hair products are \u201czero-waste alternatives,\u201d and the products are \u201cVegetarian &amp; Cruelty-Free.\u201d This is an excellent use of space, fitting this commitment to social causes into short snippets of SEO copy.<\/p>\n<p>All this and inventing the bath bomb? Amazing.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Cuddle + Kind: Google Ads copy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cuddleandkind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cuddle + Kind<\/a> makes handmade, organic, safety-certified stuffed animals for babies and children. The full-size knit animals have outfits, names, and birthdays. They also each have a wristband that shares the company\u2019s philanthropic mission of donating 10 meals for each doll sold.<\/p>\n<p>Cuddle + Kind donates proceeds from each sale\u2014not just the full-size animals\u2014to combat child hunger. The brand shares that since launching in 2015, it has helped provide 31 million meals for children in need.<\/p>\n<p>This worthy mission makes it into the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/24\/google-ads-examples\">Google Ads copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Cuddle and Kids Google Ad.\" width=\"740\" height=\"195\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87592 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp 740w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-480x126.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 740px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My favorite thing here is the description line, \u201cBelieve in the gift you give.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely sentiment that frames the product as a wonderful purchase. It\u2019s a gift that\u2019s good for more than just the recipient.<\/p>\n<h3>3. TOMS: website structure and copy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toms.com\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TOMS<\/a> is a shoe company that was launched in 2006 with a one-for-one shoe program. For every pair of original iconic flats sold, the company would donate a pair.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, after significantly expanding its offerings with more shoe styles and accessories, TOMS changed its commitment to social impact. Instead of one-for-one donations, TOMS allocated a third of its profits for giving, including grants and donations. The business was able to evolve this without changing its brand identity. Giving is still its core value.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\">website<\/a> does a great job of capturing this value and putting it front and center with a tab in the main navigation for its Impact page. Take a look at the hero copy of the Impact overview page below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Tom's ad.\" width=\"758\" height=\"227\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87593 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp 758w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1-480x144.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The copy here emphasizes a continuation of the same mission: \u201cto improve lives\u201d and \u201cdrive sustainable change.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. Blueland: CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>Emphasizing your brand\u2019s impact and commitment to its core values doesn\u2019t always have to be serious in tone, especially if it doesn\u2019t align with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueland.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blueland<\/a> is a cleaning product brand created with a simple mission: to prevent single-use plastics by making eco-friendly alternatives easy to find and use. I recently switched to Blueland laundry tablets. They come in a sleeve of brown paper packaging, and I\u2019m never going back to lugging a clunky jug of free-and-clear back from Target.<\/p>\n<p>The brand is light, clean, and youthful, and its commitment to environmentalism is enthusiastic and matter-of-fact. Here\u2019s an excellent example of how Blueland uses this in small moments, including the website footer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a> to join the newsletter.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing -Blueland email newsletter signup page.\" width=\"804\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87594 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp 804w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The joke in the headline and the promise of no spam and no waste? Sold.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. <\/strong>Viv: Email marketing<\/h3>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/vivforyourv.com\/?srsltid=AfmBOorEhZlXf4ACGgcWNJtwGRLfopo4n3n_kLbb1ZaseNpBe5T_lPSi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Viv\u2019s<\/a> marketing. The period care company is committed to toxin-free ingredients and sustainable solutions.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds serious, and it is. But Viv doesn\u2019t let the severity of these issues weigh down its storytelling or its brand. It\u2019s an excellent decision considering its target demo of young buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Viv speaks to its younger audience, who are concerned about comfort and sustainability\u2014those looking for smaller, better alternatives to major players in the market.<\/p>\n<p>Viv\u2019s brand is youthful and playful. It uses casual confessional videos, bright contrasting colors, lots of emoji, and conversational copy. This is consistent in its social media posts, on its website, and in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a recent example of an email that I received with a celebratory subject line: \u201cWE HIT A SUSTAINABILITY MILESTONE\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp\" alt=\"Purpose-driven marketing - Viv marketing.\" width=\"375\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87596 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp 375w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv-195x300.webp 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sending an email to let customers and potential customers know about what\u2019s already happened is compelling. It calls attention to the fact that other period care products are still kicking while Viv is offering a tangibly better alternative. With all the greenwashing claims in marketing these days, this focus on a tangible milestone is perfect.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Patagonia: Video marketing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.patagonia.com\/home\/\">Patagonia<\/a> might be the best, most well-known example of a company committed to purpose-driven marketing. The brand has made news for its anti-consumption marketing decisions, including a full-page ad in The New York Times urging readers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patagonia.com\/stories\/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times\/story-18615.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not to buy the jacket<\/a> and a decision to cease production of iconic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patagonia.com\/transitioning-away-from-logos.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">logo-branded vests<\/a> and other gear.<\/p>\n<p>These unconventional marketing tactics align with the company\u2019s core values, including its promise \u201cto make products that give back to the Earth as much as they take.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Patagonia\u2019s Stories We Wear is an incredibly moving long-form video series. Each installment features one person who reflects on the emotional importance of one item of clothing.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Patagonia ambassador and runner Jenn Shelton focuses on a jacket she wears often. It\u2019s one that she wore hiking with her son in the Dolomites.
