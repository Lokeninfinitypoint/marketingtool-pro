Right now, there\u2019s been an uptick in conversations about Google\u2019s Ad Strength metric. Those discussions were prompted by a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/gemini-models-are-coming-to-performance-max\/\">recent press release<\/a> from Google around some new features coming to the platform. These updates were mostly centered on updates coming to Performance Max capabilities using AI for text and imagery.<\/p>\n<p>So we felt like now was a good time to dive into Google Ad Strength and discuss whether or not it actually matters\u2014and how to improve it if it does.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-ad-strength\">What is Ad Strength?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ad-strength-impact-on-google-ads\">How does Ad Strength impact Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#updates-that-impact-ad-strength\">Recent updates that impact Ad Strength<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#should-you-pay-attention-ad-strength\">Should you pay attention to Ad Strength?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-improve-ad-strength\">How can you improve Ad Strength?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-ad-strength\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is Ad Strength?<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into whether or not you should pay attention to Ad Strength, let\u2019s talk about what it is.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, Ad Strength is meant to help advertisers develop strong ads that are more likely to perform well based on Google\u2019s data, but is only used as an indicator, not an actual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-algorithm-documents-leak\">ranking factor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In that way, it\u2019s very similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score<\/a> or Optimization Score. Both are meant to help advertisers develop strong keyword lists and ad accounts, but aren\u2019t actual dictators of how the account will do.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"ad-strength-impact-on-google-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does Ad Strength impact Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Does not having the necessary quantity and variety of assets negatively impact your ad performance?<\/p>\n<p>If you look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9142254?hl=en\">definition of Ad Strength<\/a>\u2026<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/ad-strength-definition.webp\" alt=\"ad strength definition from google\" width=\"936\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82485\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/ad-strength-definition.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/ad-strength-definition-480x184.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2026it almost seems like it would have a negative impact. Specifically, the last two sentences calling out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">maximizing performance<\/a> and the effectiveness of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>But countless advertisers have had different experiences, many of them claiming that their Poor ads actually outperformed the Excellent or Good ads in their accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may notice that ads with a Poor or Average Ad Strength don\u2019t have as many impressions as those with Good or Excellent ratings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, does a low Ad Strength mean your ads are going to have their impressions throttled?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The short answer is no to both:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ad Strength will not impact the performance of your ads on Google.<\/li>\n<li>A low Ad Strength will not prevent your ads from showing on Google.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing\u2026both of those things COULD happen IF you have low Ad Strength.<\/p>\n<p>If your Ad Strength is low, you could see worse performance for those ads.
