What this means is, make sure it&#8217;s set to allow indexing. This will look different depending on the website builder or CMS you&#8217;re using, but the good news is, most of them will make it VERY clear if you&#8217;re not set to index.<\/p>\n<p>But even if your site is being indexed, every so often, you might find a page that is not indexing. There are a few tools that can help with this. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a> can diagnose indexation errors. You can also look right in your CMS. For example, in WordPress, using the Yoast plugin, there&#8217;s a setting that will say something like: &#8220;Allow search engines to show this post in search results?:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/how-to-get-your-website-on-google-indexing.png\" alt=\"how to get your website on google - yoast plugin indexing section\" width=\"500\" height=\"169\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/how-to-get-your-website-on-google-indexing.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/how-to-get-your-website-on-google-indexing-480x162.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Alright, now that that&#8217;s out of the way, let&#8217;s talk about how to not just get on Google, but how to be visible on Google.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get your website noticed by Google<\/h2>\n<p>As you may or may not be aware, Google is the biggest game in town when it comes to getting your website noticed.

Make it easy for Google to crawl your pages<\/h3>\n<p>Google is constantly crawling the web, adding new pages to its index, and updating its profile of existing pages. The easier you make it for Google to go through your website and learn what it needs to learn, the more quickly it can add you to its index and retrieve it for searches.

Use compelling titles<\/h3>\n<p>Adding keywords to the titles of your website pages will help both Google and searchers to identify them. But you want to get <em>noticed<\/em>, not just identified. To get noticed, create compelling titles\u2014that is, aim to stand out (but don\u2019t overpromise anything or overdo it!).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-first-person-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"190\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8949\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-first-person-1.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-first-person-1-480x152.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A compelling title can go a long way in helping you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\">increase click-through rate<\/a>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a massage therapist and you\u2019ve got a blog post on the benefits of hot stone massage, consider these titles:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not compelling:<\/strong> \u201cBenefits of Hot Stone Massage\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Too extreme:<\/strong> \u201cWhy Hot Stone Massage Will Change Your Life\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compelling: <\/strong> \u201c6 Reasons to Try a Hot Stone Massage\u201d or \u201c6 Ways Hot Stone Massage Can Improve Your Health\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Aim for clear and captivating, not desperate.

Reach out to websites and blogs that have already been noticed by Google<\/h3>\n<p>Look for bloggers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">influencers<\/a> in your industry who have already captured the attention of a large audience. For example,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invite<\/strong> them to do a guest blog post on your blog. They will promote the post to their audience, which will help get your website noticed by a whole host of net new prospects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask<\/strong> to get featured in one of their round-up, review, or social media posts with a link to your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offer<\/strong> to write a guest post for their blog, with a link to your website in the post or the author bio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of which approach you take, be sure to reciprocate or offer something of equal value in exchange. Look for partnerships and collaborations that are <em>symbiotic, <\/em>in which both parties help one another reach a broader audience.<br \/>\n<a id=\"qualitycontent\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8. Write quality content<\/h3>\n<p>Writing about keywords and properly placing those keywords on your pages will help Google notice you, but if you want <em>more<\/em> <em>people<\/em> to notice you, you\u2019ve got to rank higher.<\/p>\n<p>The secret to ranking higher on Google is quality.

Provide review-worthy services<\/h3>\n<p>The majority of directories allow users to sort results based on the number of positive reviews. That means that the quantity and quality of your reviews is extremely important.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen20Shot202020-08-1320at2012.46.3420PM.png\" alt=\"How to Get Your Website Noticed on Google\" width=\"816\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nThe same goes for Google. The more reviews you have, and the better they are, the higher the chance is that a user clicks on your listing.<\/p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">get more reviews on Google <\/a>and other platforms, make sure to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provide<\/strong> outstanding services to your current AND potential customers.

Post to social media<\/h3>\n<p>One of the simplest (and most cost-efficient) ways to get your website noticed is to actively post to your business\u2019s social media accounts.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to promote your business every time you post something. A good rule is this: about 20% of your posts should directly promote your business. The rest should be in the realm of helpful how-tos and guides you\u2019ve created, or other content you find interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Stay actively engaged on social media to get your posts to stand out. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask<\/strong> conversation-starting questions<\/li>\n<li><strong>Answer <\/strong>your followers questions (being funny is a bonus!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-12-27-at-11.52.26-AM.png\" alt=\"How to Get Your Website Noticed on Google\" width=\"595\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Join<\/strong> LinkedIn and Facebook groups<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">popular or custom hashtags<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Direct<\/strong> people who have asked questions on social media to your site for answers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note also that your social media profiles and posts can sometimes show on the first page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/website-visibility-social-media-profiles-on-first-page-google.png\" alt=\"how to improve website visibility - social profiles on the SERP\" width=\"689\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55746\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/website-visibility-social-media-profiles-on-first-page-google.png 689w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/website-visibility-social-media-profiles-on-first-page-google-480x417.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 689px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>13. Shareability = noticeability<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than just your social media followers, why not get your <em>followers\u2019<\/em> followers to notice your website too? Use images, compelling captions, and relevant topics to maximize the appeal of your posts. If you link to a brand you like in one of your blog posts, make sure to let that brand know on social media or via email.<\/p>\n<p>This can cause a snowball effect of reposts and help you to cast an even wider virtual net.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Use local media<\/h3>\n<p>Plenty of local media outlets will give you mentions in their publications for free or for a reasonable fee.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to shell out some billboard dollars, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/26\/out-of-home-advertising\">out-of-home advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20spotify2_0.png\" alt=\"How to Get Your Website Noticed on Google OOH Ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nReach out to local papers, magazines, radio stations and news channels with an interesting story about your organization or upcoming event and direct traffic to your website for more information. Placing ads in newspapers and local publications will also help to garner some newcomers to your site.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Seize small opportunities to get noticed<\/h3>\n<p>Promote your website anywhere you can. Include it in your email signature, on promotional flyers, on invoices, and on receipts. You may even want to slap a decal on your car!
