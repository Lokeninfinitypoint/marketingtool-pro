I do not recommend that lead gen businesses test it unless you have sophisticated conversion tracking set up (see the first \u201cdo\u201d below).<\/p>\n<p>And regardless of business objectives, don\u2019t even think about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/01\/is-performance-max-right-for-you\">testing Performance Max<\/a> unless you\u2019re prepared to spend at least $50-100 per day for at least a month; without it, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll generate enough data and learning for the format to work properly.<\/p>\n<h2>10 tips for success with Google Ads Performance Max<\/h2>\n<p>Here are my top 10 dos, don&#8217;ts, watchouts and workarounds for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\">optimizing your Performance Max campaigns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. DO \ud83d\udc4d implement accurate, full-funnel conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Performance Max relies heavily on both bidding and targeting automation, similar to predecessors like App campaigns, Smart Display, and Local campaigns. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">Conversion tracking<\/a> is always important in a Google Ads account, but it\u2019s even more important in Performance Max. While this is pretty easy on the ecommerce side, I\u2019ve seen many lead gen businesses struggle with lead quality.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is not a failing of the format, but rather a stark reminder of the importance of tools like enhanced conversions, offline conversion tracking, CRM integration, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions.png\" alt=\"best marketing strategies 2022 - how enhanced conversions work in google ads\" width=\"720\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55689\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions-480x299.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We know that automation will only continue to grow in importance in PPC, so if you\u2019ve been avoiding your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking challenges<\/a>, now\u2019s the time to hunker down and fix them.<\/p>\n<h3>2. WORKAROUND \ud83d\udd03: Create a PMax segment in Google Analytics for better reporting<\/h3>\n<p>There are a variety of Google Ads reporting features that are not (yet?) available in Performance Max, like landing page reports or accurate geographic reports, but I\u2019ve found Google Analytics to be a helpful workaround.<\/p>\n<p>Create a segment of users for whom the acquisition campaign contains Performance Max (or whichever naming convention you use), and then you\u2019ll gain much deeper insight into how these users are interacting with your business. For example, you can use a Google Analytics segment on the Landing Page Report to see where the campaign is driving them, and whether you need to add URL exclusions or turn off URL expansion (see next section).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-analytics-segment-builder.png\" alt=\"google analytics segment builder\" width=\"720\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-analytics-segment-builder.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-analytics-segment-builder-480x289.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. WATCH OUT \ud83d\udea8 for URL expansion<\/h3>\n<p>We know that Performance Max campaigns are an amalgamation of many Google Ads formats into one: Search, Display, Discovery, Video, Shopping, Local \u2014pretty much everything except App (for now\u2026). So it\u2019s fitting that there is a handful of Performance Max features that \u201cborrow\u201d from other campaign idiosyncrasies.<\/p>\n<p>One of those idiosyncrasies that\u2019s easy to miss is URL expansion, the PMax version of Dynamic Search Ads. By default, Performance Max campaigns have URL expansion turned on. This means that unless you turn it off, the campaign has permission to send users to landing pages <em>other<\/em> than your final URL, kind of like a dynamic ad group.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-final-URL-expansion.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - URL expansion defaults to on\" width=\"720\" height=\"238\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62445\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-final-URL-expansion.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-final-URL-expansion-480x159.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The key difference, however, is that with a dynamic ad group, you get to set your ad <em>targets<\/em>: the specific landing pages to which you want the campaign to drive traffic. You can do this by listing out specific webpages, or creating a set of rules, such as \u201cURL contains product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Performance Max, you can only set <em>exclusions<\/em>: the landing pages to which you do <em>not<\/em> want the campaign to drive traffic. Exclusion rules work the same way, but require a bit of a logical flip to set properly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-exclude-urls.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - URL exclusion\" width=\"615\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-exclude-urls.png 615w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-exclude-urls-480x455.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 615px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. DON\u2019T \u261d\ufe0f forget to add at least 1 video asset<\/h3>\n<p>One of the trickiest parts of setting up a Performance Max campaign isn\u2019t the bid strategy or the audience signal, it\u2019s providing enough assets for this creative-hungry format. Since the campaign covers so many different types of inventory, you\u2019ll need to feed it lots of text, image and video assets.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever set up a Display campaign, then you know that including video assets there is optional. In PMax, it is not optional. Or rather, if you don\u2019t provide any video assets, then Google Ads will create them for you. While I\u2019m sure the templates will get better over time, right now\u2026 well, the auto-generated video assets leave something to be desired.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers who don\u2019t have any video assets, but want to use Performance Max, can use a free tool like Canva to animate your image assets into a short video. <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/canva-video-ad-templates.png\" alt=\"canva video ad templates\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/canva-video-ad-templates.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/canva-video-ad-templates-480x256.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As with all Google Ads campaigns, your video must be uploaded to YouTube before it can be used in a campaign. If you don\u2019t want your video ad to be visible on your YouTube channel, select \u201cUnlisted\u201d visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>5. WATCH OUT \u26a0\ufe0f for tricky location settings<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">location targeting<\/a>, you can choose whether you want to target based on \u201cPresence or interest\u201d (people in the location or interested in it) or \u201cPresence&#8221; only. I recommend &#8220;Presence&#8221; only because otherwise, your ads could be showing to people outside of the locations you set.<\/p>\n<p>But Google defaults to the former. So be sure to change that<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - location options\" width=\"500\" height=\"241\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-51042\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest-480x231.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have been mistakenly running your campaign using Presence or interest, that Google Analytics segment I mentioned earlier will come in handy, as it will show you which locations are driving traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-segment.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - audience segment\" width=\"720\" height=\"327\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-segment.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-segment-480x218.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. DO \u2705 use Performance Max for conversion objectives only<\/h3>\n<p>Like Discovery campaigns, Performance Max campaigns will only let you bid for Conversion or Conversion Value. Perhaps one day we\u2019ll see an \u201cAwareness Max\u201d coming out, but in the meantime, this format should only be used for conversion-based objectives.<\/p>\n<p>If you do want to use Performance Max for a mid-funnel or upper-funnel objective, you can set conversion actions at the campaign level to do so. For example, if for some reason you want to test PMax on an awareness objective, create a \u201cPage View\u201d conversion action, and set the campaign to only optimize for Page Views.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-conversion-actions-google-ads.png\" alt=\"google ads website conversion actions\" width=\"720\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62604\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-conversion-actions-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-conversion-actions-google-ads-480x217.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. DO \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe create an audience signal<\/h3>\n<p>With the launch of Performance Max campaigns, Google Ads introduced us to the seemingly new concept of an audience signal.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, when you add audiences to your campaign, you tell Google Ads exactly which type of users you\u2019d like to show ads to. You are in control of your targeting.<\/p>\n<p>When you create an audience signal in Performance Max, you let Google Ads know what type of users you\u2019re interested in showing ads to. However, PMax will only use these audience segments as a <em>starting point<\/em> to serve ads. Then, once it starts gathering data, it will branch out beyond your signal and show ads to people who exhibit behavior that suggests they are likely to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Incidentally, this is how optimized targeting works in Display, Discovery, and conversion-focused <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/29\/google-ads-video-campaign-settings\">Video campaigns<\/a>: you choose your audience segments, but Google will ultimately show ads to whoever it thinks is most likely to convert. In my opinion, the rebranding of \u201coptimized targeting\u201d as an \u201caudience signal\u201d is a wise move, as it implies more user control rather than letting the machines run wild.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-updates-september-2021-optimized-targeting-display.png\" alt=\"google ads updates september 2021: optimized targeting default for display campaigns\" width=\"720\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-updates-september-2021-optimized-targeting-display.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-updates-september-2021-optimized-targeting-display-480x175.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-performance-max\/409736\/#close\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In order to set your audience signal off in the right direction, you should add two kinds of audience segments to it: Remarketing and a Custom audience. For Remarketing, a customer list is best, but failing that, pixel-based website remarketing will do. For the Custom audience, I like to build it using my top converting Search &amp; Shopping search terms.<\/p>\n<p>All of the audience signals in a Google Ads account sit on a separate tab in Audience Manager from your data segments. Even if you create them from within a Performance Max campaign, they\u2019ll be accessible at the account level. This suggests that Google has grand plans for the audience signal beyond PMax, so watch this space.<\/p>\n<h3>8. DO \u2714\ufe0f check the Insights tab for improvements in reporting transparency<\/h3>\n<p>Much fuss has been made about the lack of reporting transparency in Performance Max, and while some of that is true, there\u2019s actually quite a bit of useful information on the Insights tab.<\/p>\n<p>Once your campaign has been running for a few days\/weeks (depending on your budget), you will start to see the top performing \u201cSearch categories\u201d and \u201cAudience segments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A search category is a group of similar search terms. While not as crystal clear as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\">search terms report<\/a>, it will answer two important questions for you:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is PMax focusing on brand or non-brand searches?<\/li>\n<li>Is PMax finding new searches or targeting the same ones you already have in your search campaigns?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In this example, the top search category included high-performing existing search terms and the second search category included brand terms, but the third search category was one we had not been targeting\u2014and as you can see, that opened up a large incremental opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-terms.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - search terms\" width=\"720\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-terms.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-terms-480x279.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The audience segments reporting will show you which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">Google audiences<\/a> your converting users belong to. This is really helpful to gauge if the Video\/Display portion of your Performance Max campaign is reaching the right audience. In this example, the two in-market audience segments driving 60% of conversions were both very relevant to this advertiser.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-top-audience-segments.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - top performing audience segments\" width=\"720\" height=\"293\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-top-audience-segments.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-top-audience-segments-480x195.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9. DON\u2019T \u26d4\ufe0f duplicate your Merchant Center feed imagery as image assets<\/h3>\n<p>If you connect your Google Merchant Center feed to Performance Max, then just like a Shopping campaign, PMax will use the information in your feed (titles, pricing, images, availability, etc.) to create ads.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this, I do not recommend adding your \u201cecommerce images\u201d as separate image assets in your Performance Max asset group. The campaign already has these images from your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">feed<\/a>! It\u2019s duplicative.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, add lifestyle images that show your products or services in use by real humans. Google\u2019s own guidance for Discovery assets provides some great tips for what kinds of images perform well, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid overlaid text or keep it minimal.<\/li>\n<li>Show images in a real-life context rather than a stark, \u201cstock\u201d background.<\/li>\n<li>Highlight a single focal point, framed centrally, that takes up 30% to 40% of the image.<\/li>\n<li>Humans; images with real people outperform those without.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>10. WATCHOUT \ud83d\udc40 for customer acquisition rules<\/h3>\n<p>Smart Shopping may have been replaced by Performance Max, but it left the legacy of customer acquisition rules. In your PMax campaign setting, you have the option to only bid for new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Bidding for new customers is a great option if your Performance Max campaign is heaving up on branded search and remarketing, and you want to leverage the format to focus on acquisition instead. However, remember to adjust your performance expectations accordingly; a PMax campaign focused on acquisition will not perform as \u201cwell\u201d as a PMax campaign focused on bottom-of-funnel conversion, since it will take longer (and potentially more ads) to turn those new users into customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-objectives-goals.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - goals and objectives\" width=\"720\" height=\"305\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-objectives-goals.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-objectives-goals-480x203.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-customer-acquisition.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - customer acquisition\" width=\"720\" height=\"216\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-customer-acquisition.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-customer-acquisition-480x144.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How to run Performance Max campaigns right<\/h2>\n<p>Like I said above, I think ecommerce businesses should definitely start testing PMax now. Lead gen businesses can too, but only if their conversion tracking setup is in top shape. And be prepared to put enough budget in so you can generate the data Google needs to learn and optimize.
