With Facebook being around longer, having more data, and more ad placements compared to its younger adopted sibling platform, we do find that more often than not, Instagram is slightly more expensive than Facebook in some instances. While that is the case, don\u2019t let it deter you from exploring this lucrative and effective visual counterpart in the Facebook ecosystem. With fewer ad placements, increased competition for impression share, you may pay slightly more to use Instagram, but you may also pleasantly see it being much more cost-effective than the results you\u2019re getting with Facebook.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-40642\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples.png\" alt=\"instagram ads costs: instagram ad examples\" width=\"536\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples.png 536w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples-480x337.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 536px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Paid advertising is a powerful marketing tool on Instagram and complements what brands are able to do in their Feeds, Stories, and Explore tabs. While Reels and IGTV don\u2019t yet have ad placements, we may very well see them added as placement as the platform continues to scale and the need for more impressions comes about. Like Facebook ads, Instagram ads offer advanced targeting and flexibility so as to be accessible for just about any business. If this visual platform is a popular channel for your target audience, you may want to advertise on Instagram.

Since Facebook is its parent company, all you need a Facebook Business Page. However, it is best to have an Instagram account so you can familiarize yourself with content that resonates best with your target audience and complement and amplify your organic Instagram marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">To set up Instagram Ads<\/a>, use Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/\">Ads Manager<\/a> to set up campaigns, ad sets where you select your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/stretch-your-marketing-budget\">budget<\/a>, target audience, ad placements, and optimization options.

These platforms have an incredibly robust arsenal of targeting data and since Facebook owns Instagram, Instagram advertising utilizes the same comprehensive <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/28\/instagram-demographics-2021\">demographic<\/a> and geographic data. This advanced targeting is what makes Facebook Ads work so well, as you can be incredibly prescriptive when targeting various audiences. Whether you are utilizing Facebook\u2019s native audiences based on interests, behaviors, or other demographics,\u00a0or utilizing your own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/27\/facebook-custom-audiences\">custom audiences<\/a> that utilize your Pixel or SDK, email lists, or other sources, you can find success in reaching the right people in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">prospecting<\/a> and retargeting campaigns.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-targeting-1.png\" alt=\"How much do Instagram ads cost\u2014custom audience creation options\" width=\"800\" height=\"470\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Higher engagement rates<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is known for its high engagement rates\u2014organically and through paid ads. Images on Instagram receive an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/instagram-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">23% more engagement<\/a> than when shared on Facebook. When it comes to organic engagement, brands on Instagram say that they have about <a href=\"https:\/\/go.forrester.com\/blogs\/14-04-29-instagram_is_the_king_of_social_engagement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4% of their followers seeing their content<\/a> compared to the nearly non-existent organic reach that Facebook has today. While it\u2019s better, it\u2019s still wise to pay to play in order to expand your reach and visibility with paid ads.\u00a0 While any form of visual content can perform well, brands typically see more engagement on video ads\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/mention.com\/en\/reports\/instagram\/engagement\/#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 38% more<\/a>.

With fewer ad placements and increased competition for impression share, you may pay slightly more to use Instagram, but you may also pleasantly see it being much more cost-effective than the results you\u2019re getting with Facebook.<\/p>\n<h2>Factors that influence Instagram ads costs<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to other platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/instagram-ads-cost\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/instagram-ads-cost\">Instagram ad pricing<\/a> is influenced by a number of variables.<\/p>\n<h3>Campaign objective<\/h3>\n<p>Campaign objectives can cause your advertising costs to be automatically higher or lower, depending on which you choose and how it relates to where your target audience is in the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you select a brand awareness campaign objective, it will be lower in cost than something lower down the funnel and that has a higher value objective, such as conversions. Having broader, colder audiences see your ad to\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">drive brand awareness<\/a> is a lower-value action compared to targeting a user further down funnel\u2014who are more familiar with your brand and offerings, and ready to open their wallet or take a higher-value action.<\/p>\n<h3>Audience size<\/h3>\n<p>If you are targeting broader audiences, they are typically lower in cost as there is less competition for a group of people. As you narrow your audiences, perhaps by reducing their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">geotargeting<\/a> or age ranges, you may see the price go up as competition for those eyeballs increases in parallel. Retargeting audiences are typically smaller as well, hence why we often see higher costs in retargeting campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>Budget<\/h3>\n<p>Budget also influences Instagram ad costs because if you have a small budget, it may take longer to get out of the Learning Phase if your campaign or ad set is starting anew. Costs may be more expensive at first before the system learns and understands your\u00a0campaign type and\u00a0optimization goals, and how your audience engages with your ads. If your ads are well engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.<\/p>\n<h3>Click-through rate<\/h3>\n<p>If CTR is low, then we may see higher costs as the system thinks there may be some disconnect between your target audience and what you\u2019re messaging in your ads. You want your ads to resonate with your target audience and CTR Is a strong indicator of that. Aim for a healthy CTR which is about 2%. If you have a healthy CTR, you should see your costs decrease.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite12SecretsToHigherCTR.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_PPC_HigherCTR_Download\">12 Secrets to a Higher Click-Through Rate (&amp; Lower Costs!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to lower your Instagram ads costs<\/h2>\n<p>Make the most of your budget by selecting funnel-appropriate campaign objectives to start. If you are targeting colder, broader, prospecting audiences, test less expensive campaigns to introduce your brand to audiences with an awareness, engagement, or better yet, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/17\/facebook-click-to-call-ads\">website traffic campaign<\/a> so that these users leave Instagram and get to your website and tagged with the Pixel so you can later retarget them if they don\u2019t convert on that first click. If you\u2019re new to Instagram Ads, you can drive sales from the first interaction and click, but more often than not, users will need to have several interactions with your brands in order to develop trust, perhaps do some shopping and comparing, and then come back to you through retargeting or other means to open up their wallets. If you have a low-cost product that doesn\u2019t need much research, impulse buys can be successful from Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to lower your Instagram costs is to use automatic placements in the ad set level and serve across both Facebook and Instagram. By having more placement liquidity, the system can use its algorithm to determine where to best serve your ads, thus giving them more options across both platforms and more ad placements, thus, lowering competition on Instagram\u2019s three current ad placements, thus lowering your costs.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40641\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-automatic-placement.png\" alt=\"how much do instagram ads cost: automatic placements\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-automatic-placement.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-automatic-placement-480x212.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYou will also want to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/25\/a-b-testing\"> test audiences <\/a>with different ad variations by testing the different lines of ad copy and creatives \u2013 images and videos.
