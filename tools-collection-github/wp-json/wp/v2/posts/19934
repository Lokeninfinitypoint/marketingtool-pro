Household-name brands and small businesses alike use Instagram giveaways to create buzz about new product lines, reach new fans, and grow their social followings.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the prizes are incredible, while others may be\u2026 a little lackluster. Regardless of what you\u2019re giving away (or trying to win), Instagram giveaways can be a great way to create some buzz and attract some potential new fans.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Should I Consider Running an Instagram Giveaway?<\/h2>\n<p>Although you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-do-an-instagram-giveaway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">run an Instagram giveaway<\/a> for just about any reason you can think of, the two primary reasons you may want to consider this kind of promotion are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>To encourage <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/19\/social-sharing\">social sharing<\/a> of a specific Instagram post<\/li>\n<li>To grow your Instagram following<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-follower-count.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways follower count\" width=\"600\" height=\"1070\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Ideally, a good Instagram giveaway should accomplish both of these goals. A highly shareable post will drive social shares by itself, which leads to greater exposure and impression share, while the giveaway entry criteria should accomplish the secondary goal of growing your Instagram audience.<\/p>\n<p>The more people participate, the farther your post will be shared, which means more entries, which means more followers, which means more shares\u2026 you get the idea.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Would I Give Something Away for Free in an Instagram Giveaway?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never used this kind of promotion before, you might be wondering if running an Instagram giveaway is a little counterintuitive. This is a fair point, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s worth looking at in a little more depth.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-make-it-rain.gif\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways make it rain gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Original art\/animation by <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/snowbacon.deviantart.com\/\"><em>Snowbacon<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard the expression, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to spend money to make money.\u201d This is true of the largest corporations and the scrappiest mom-and-pop shops alike. There are very few truly free ways to promote your business (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/08\/grassroots-marketing\">though there <em>are<\/em> some<\/a>), and whichever way you look at it, you\u2019re going to spend <em>something<\/em> to grow your audience. This includes investments of your time (which you\u2019d need if you were to focus on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">growing your Instagram following<\/a> organically), budget for paid social campaigns if you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">advertising on Instagram<\/a>, or inventory if you\u2019re planning on running a giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>Only you can decide on the value of a giveaway. Viewing the experience as an investment, rather than a loss, however, may make it easier to reconcile.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Run an Instagram Giveaway<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so you\u2019ve decided to take the plunge and run your first Instagram giveaway! So now what? Well, now you have to actually set up and run your giveaway.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Choose the Prize for Your Instagram Giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Before you get started actually running your Instagram giveaway, you need to decide on a suitable prize for the lucky entrant(s) to win.<\/p>\n<p>My wife Nicky recently ran her first Instagram giveaway to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the opening of her design studio and enamel pin company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/CATPARTYDesign\">CATPARTY<\/a> (yes, all caps, and no, I won\u2019t apologize for such a shameless plug).<\/p>\n<p>Before she did anything else, she decided that she would offer a bundle of products known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/473263582\/catparty-starter-pack-vinyl-sticker-1-in?ref=shop_home_feat_3\">the Party Pack<\/a> as the prize for her giveaway. The Party Pack includes a limited-edition one-inch enamel pin, a one-inch button, and a vinyl sticker featuring CATPARTY\u2019s lovable brand ambassador, Party Cat.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-party-cat.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways CATPARTY Party Cat mascot\" width=\"537\" height=\"537\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Party Cat \u2013 he\u2019s here to party.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The total value of the individual items in the Party Pack is around $14, while the pack itself sells for just over $12. To Nicky, this was the ideal product for an Instagram giveaway; enough to entice people to enter the giveaway (more on this momentarily), yet not so expensive that it would be detrimental to sales revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing a suitable prize is a balancing act. You need to make sure people have enough incentive to enter your giveaway by offering something sufficiently attractive, but without taking a serious loss on the product you choose to give away.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Decide the Entry Criteria for Your Instagram Giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>For her Instagram giveaway, Nicky decided that entrants had to do two things to enter:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/catpartydotco\/\">CATPARTY on Instagram<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Tag two people when sharing the original post<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Every person who completed both of these criteria was entered into the giveaway. However, as a little extra incentive, Nicky also decided that for every additional person an entrant tagged when sharing the post, the entrant would receive an additional entry.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-impressions.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways Insights Impressions\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1693\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The main objective of Nicky\u2019s giveaway wasn\u2019t to boost sales, but to gain exposure and grow her Instagram following. That\u2019s why following CATPARTY was the primary entry criteria. She had hoped that by combining this with the two-person tag criteria, she would increase her following considerably. Every additional person tagged by an entrant was another potential follower.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly to choosing a suitable prize to give away, deciding on the entry criteria for your Instagram giveaway is about balance. You need to ensure that whatever you ask of potential entrants will help you achieve your primary goal, but you also <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/10\/increase-conversion-rates\">can\u2019t ask too much of people<\/a> or you risk limiting the size of your entry pool.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-web-form-example.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways WordStream web form AB test example\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is just like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/27\/landing-page-forms\">optimizing a web form<\/a>; include too many fields and you\u2019ll probably turn off a sizable number of people who would have otherwise entered the contest (or clicked through from your landing page, to continue the web form analogy). Include too few fields and you risk failing to achieve your goal of growing your following (or capturing too little data about your prospects).<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Decide How Long Your Instagram Giveaway Will Last<\/h3>\n<p>The next decision you need to make is how much time you\u2019ll give your audience to enter your Instagram giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>Nicky opted to run her Instagram giveaway for seven days. She had originally planned to launch the contest on a Monday \u2013 which meant it would have ended on the Sunday night \u2013 but due to an unforeseen last-minute complication, she had to push the contest back by a couple of days. In the end, she ran the giveaway from Tuesday morning to Wednesday evening, giving entrants a full seven days to enter.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-deadline.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways deadline\" width=\"861\" height=\"648\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The length of your Instagram giveaway might depend on several factors.<\/p>\n<p>For one, there\u2019s the size of your existing following. It may make more sense, for example, to run a shorter giveaway if you have thousands of followers. For Nicky, who has a much more modest following, a full week seemed the right amount of time. It\u2019s also worth considering that your giveaway may run out of steam or hit the wall of diminishing returns the longer it runs, so think carefully about this before making any public announcements.<\/p>\n<p>Also, think about time zones and international audiences. Not all of your entrants are likely to be in the same time zone, so be sure it\u2019s crystal clear precisely when your contest ends. You could also post reminders to help people remember that the contest is coming to a close \u2013 which is another way to encourage last-minute entries!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-air-mail-australia-stamp.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways Air Mail stamp Australia\" width=\"730\" height=\"410\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nicky had to consider whether international entries would be accepted at all due to additional shipping costs compared to the overall value of the prize. In the end, she decided that she would accept international entries, but she had to include <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">a short disclaimer about shipping costs to avoid nasty surprises<\/a> if someone in, say, Australia won the contest.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Create the Perfect Instagram Giveaway Post<\/h3>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve done all the prep work, and now you\u2019re ready to actually launch your Instagram giveaway. Before you can do this, you\u2019ll need an actual Instagram post to use.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cperfect\u201d Instagram giveaway post will vary widely from one account to another. However, there are a couple of elements that every Instagram giveaway post should include. These are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A strong, color image to serve as the basis for the post<\/li>\n<li>Efficient use of text announcing the giveaway<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For her Instagram giveaway, Nicky used the following image:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-catparty-contest-post.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways CATPARTY contest post\" width=\"860\" height=\"645\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, the main image of the post features a bold, colorful visual as well as text announcing the contest. Although she could have used more text in the image itself, Nicky wisely chose to keep the inclusion of text in the image to the bare minimum, instead using the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/23\/instagram-captions\">caption<\/a> section of the post to let people know how to enter.<\/p>\n<p>While there are no hard-and-fast rules about how to create Instagram posts for giveaways, it\u2019s worthwhile considering your post from the audience\u2019s perspective. If you\u2019re giving away a specific product, it makes sense to include an image of that product in your announcement post; it would be misleading to include an image of a Maserati sports car in an Instagram giveaway for a weekend yoga retreat, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re happy with your post, publish it and start the clock!<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Create \u2018Reminder\u2019 Posts to Share Throughout Your Instagram Giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Although Instagram posts may not be quite as \u201cdisposable\u201d as tweets, the sheer volume of posts you can see at any given time on an Instagram timeline is considerable, especially if you follow a lot of people.<\/p>\n<p>As such, Instagram giveaways aren\u2019t quite \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d and you should be prepared to provide regular updates on how much time is left to enter your giveaway to ensure a steady stream of entrants continues throughout the duration of the competition.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-reminder-post.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways reminder post\" width=\"858\" height=\"630\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Only you can decide how often to publish \u201creminder\u201d posts. Nicky opted to publish a single reminder post on Day Three of the contest. She decided early on that, based on her research, multiple updates per day was <em>way<\/em> too much, and since her giveaway lasted for seven days, the single mid-week reminder worked well.<\/p>\n<p>The reminder posts themselves should be primarily visually striking so that they catch people\u2019s eye as they browse their timeline. The captions should reiterate the rules of the giveaway, but it might be worth experimenting with the length of your captions depending on the frequency of your reminder posts. In Nicky\u2019s case, a simple variant of the original post with a shortened caption was enough, but you may want to create more elaborate posts depending on your needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Tally the Results of Your Instagram Giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>So it\u2019s been a week (or however long your giveaway ran for), and you\u2019ve amassed a list of Instagram followers who entered your contest. Now all that remains is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.easypromosapp.com\/instagram-sweepstakes\/?utm_source=Wordstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pick the lucky winner<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Tallying up the entrants of your Instagram giveaway can be a piece of cake, or it can be a logistical nightmare \u2013 it all depends on your entry criteria and the volume of entrants.<\/p>\n<p>After her giveaway had concluded, Nicky went through her Instagram feed and entered all the names of entrants who had abided by the rules into a spreadsheet. Each entrant\u2019s name was entered onto a different row. Individuals who only entered once \u2013 by following CATPARTY and tagging two other people \u2013 were entered on a single row, while other entrants who tagged more people were entered into multiple rows to reflect the number of entries.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-winner-post.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways winner announcement post\" width=\"839\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The lucky winner and their swag<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To find the winner of her Instagram giveaway, Nicky used a simple online name-picking tool to select a winner from the list of entrants. Unfortunately, none of the software tools we came across supported CSV upload functionality, meaning that each name had to be entered manually, with entrants who submitted multiple entries being entered the relevant number of times. (If you know of a tool that supports uploads, let me know in the comments!)<\/p>\n<p>No matter which way you slice it, actually determining the winner of your Instagram giveaway is likely to be at least a little work, so choose a system that allows you to select a winner as efficiently \u2013 and fairly \u2013 as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 7: Spread the News About the Winner of Your Instagram Giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve ran your first Instagram giveaway and selected a lucky winner from the horde of entrants. All that\u2019s left to do now is notify the lucky winner!<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you could just send the winner a direct message, but that would be a missed opportunity. Why not make the announcement of the winner as much of a spectacle as the rest of the contest?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-winner-announcement.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways winner announcement post\" width=\"866\" height=\"639\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Letting the lucky winner know they\u2019ve won your Instagram giveaway is yet another opportunity for exposure and growing your following. It lets the winner know they\u2019ve won in a fun and exciting way, and also gives you the chance to thank the unlucky entrants as well as let your audience know about relevant forthcoming sales or future competitions.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Your Instagram Giveaway Data in Future Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram giveaways aren\u2019t just a great way to boost your following and create buzz about your store \u2013 they\u2019re a veritable treasure-trove of data just waiting to be explored.<\/p>\n<p>You probably already know that you can access analytics data for your Instagram feed if your account is a Business account. If you\u2019ve never checked out this data, immediately after an Instagram giveaway is the perfect time to start.<\/p>\n<p>Once Nicky\u2019s Instagram giveaway had concluded, she delved into her analytics data to learn more about her audience.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-follower-analytics.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways follower analytics\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1693\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nicky learned all sorts of interesting information after her contest. For instance, she learned that she had a loyal (and growing) following in London, despite being based on the East Coast of the United States. This is largely because the enamel pin community is <em>very<\/em> tight-knit, and is generally pretty trendy in the British capital. Nicky has also made multiple sales to customers in London, which could also help account for this trend.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, Nicky looked at some more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">audience demographic data<\/a>. She learned that the majority of her audience is female, and between the ages of 25-34 \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/28\/generational-marketing-tactics\">a very lucrative and desirable demographic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-audience-demographics.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways audience demographics\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1694\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Unlike some analytics data, demographic information may not be impacted as significantly by Instagram giveaways. Unless you\u2019re offering a significantly imbalanced (or unfair) advantage to one demographic over another \u2013 say, giving women twice as many chances to win as men \u2013 you can probably be quite confident in the integrity of your demographic data before or after you run your contest.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that while Instagram analytics data can be immensely useful, you should approach this data carefully if you\u2019re examining it after a giveaway. For example, you can see in the screenshot above that many of Nicky\u2019s followers started following CATPARTY\u2019s Instagram feed on Thursday afternoons. However, given that her Instagram giveaway ran from a Tuesday morning to a Wednesday night, this follower data could have easily been skewed by the contest.<\/p>\n<p>That said, this data could also indicate strong interest in entries on Day Two of the competition \u2013 potentially valuable insight for future giveaways.<\/p>\n<h2>How Did CATPARTY\u2019s Instagram Giveaway Go?<\/h2>\n<p>By now, you might be wondering how successful CATPARTY\u2019s inaugural Instagram giveaway was.<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier in the post that the primary goal of CATPARTY\u2019s giveaway was to increase the number of followers CATPARTY has on Instagram \u2013 any sales would be gravy, but boosting sales wasn\u2019t the main objective.<\/p>\n<p>Before the giveaway, CATPARTY had approximately 200 Instagram followers. Afterwards, it had 340 followers \u2013 <strong>an increase of 70%!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If we use traditional marketing metrics as a barometer of success, we can calculate the cost-per-acquisition of each new Instagram follower. We can do this by dividing the value of the prize Nicky featured in her Instagram giveaway (around $12) by the number of followers she gained during the contest.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-follower-stats.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways follower statistics\" width=\"892\" height=\"592\" \/><\/div>\n<p>CATPARTY attracted roughly 140 new followers during the competition, so we can calculate that <strong>each new follower cost <em>just eight cents<\/em> to acquire<\/strong> \u2013 not too shabby at all, especially when you consider that each of these followers is genuine and authentic (unlike followers Instagram profiles can pay to acquire), and has the potential to become a paying customer further down the road. In terms of ROI, this is pretty awesome, even if the figures themselves are rather modest.<\/p>\n<h3>Using Third-Party Instagram Analytics Tools<\/h3>\n<p>Out of sheer curiosity, I wanted to delve a little deeper into Nicky\u2019s Instagram analytics data to see other aspects of CATPARTY\u2019s Instagram presence had been impacted by the giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/21\/instagram-marketing-tools\">Instagram offers some decent tools<\/a> of its own, it\u2019s still a little lacking. I used <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/24\/online-marketing-tools\">a free online tool<\/a> called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gabstats.com\/\">Gabstats<\/a> to evaluate other performance metrics during the week of Nicky\u2019s Instagram giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>During the week of the contest, CATPARTY made 10 posts to Instagram. In this time period, CATPARTY\u2019s Instagram posts received:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>536 total Likes<\/li>\n<li>54 Likes per post on average<\/li>\n<li>111 total comments<\/li>\n<li>12 comments per post on average<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We can take a look at each of Gabstat\u2019s performance metrics individually. Below is a graph of Likes made on CATPARTY\u2019s Instagram posts throughout the duration of the giveaway:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-performance-metrics-likes.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways Likes graph\" width=\"1112\" height=\"598\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, Likes of CATPARTY\u2019s posts during the contest rose dramatically between March 5 and March 6 \u2013 the day that Nicky published her reminder post.<\/p>\n<p>We can also see which posts were the most popular during our custom date range:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-performance-metrics-best-posts.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways most popular posts\" width=\"1020\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Interestingly, in terms of Likes, each of the top three strongest posts performed similarly. As you can see, however, comments were very strong for the announcement post, yet there was only a single comment on the reminder post six days later. (The second-strongest post was part of a month-long \u201cMeet the Maker\u201d series in which CATPARTY was participating.)<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-performance-metrics-hashtags.png\" alt=\"Instagram giveaways hashtags\" width=\"865\" height=\"454\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the figure above, we can see which of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/02\/twitter-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a> Nicky used throughout her Instagram giveaway that correlated with the most Likes. The hashtags #pinstagram and #pingiveaway were tied for second place (#pinstagram is a very common and popular hashtag among the enamel pin community, as is the third hashtag, #pingame). This provides you with further data to optimize your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Rather frustratingly, Gabstats doesn\u2019t offer graphed or tabular data for follower counts, so we\u2019ll have to rely on other data for this information. Still, it\u2019s not bad for a free tool.
