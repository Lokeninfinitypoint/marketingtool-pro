But for industries where trust is a major factor, like home services, real estate, and healthcare, this is the way to go. People are more attracted to safe and traditional here than disruptive and edgy.<\/p>\n<h3>Before<\/h3>\n<p>The dentist ad below for a free new patient exam has the right idea\u2014to share its philosophy and personal messages from each dentist. But there is so much focus on values that the offer hardly stands out.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary text:<\/strong> Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s 213 words and 1197 characters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Image text:<\/strong> <em>Welcome! from your [town name] dentists<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline:<\/strong> <em>FREE New Patients Dental Exam<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Description:<\/strong> <em>Call &amp; schedule your appointment today!<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-long-primary-text-dental.png\" alt=\"facebook ad copy example - long primary text\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-long-primary-text-dental.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-long-primary-text-dental-980x523.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-long-primary-text-dental-480x256.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While this is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">decent marketing copy<\/a>, it&#8217;s a lot of primary text for a scrolling Facebook user (Facebook recommends 125 characters) and better suited for an about us page. (But I will say, an <a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-copy-length-experiment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experiment by Ad Espresso<\/a> shows that long copy can actually be successful in some scenarios, so maybe that was the case with this ad.)<\/p>\n<p>And as mentioned above, the true offer (free new patient exam) and call to action (book an appointment) get drowned out by the second call to action (to welcome the new dentists) which is emphasized in the primary text and ad creative.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd11 Takeaway: <\/strong>Long primary text works in some cases, but you&#8217;ll want those first 125 characters to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/12\/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy\">compelling-enough copy<\/a> to get the user to tap the ol&#8217; &#8220;Read more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>After<\/h3>\n<p>This copy is much better!

Is it the in-office dental savings plan? Or something different? Pair this primary text and creative with the headline and description above, and this Facebook ad copy would be<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd11 Takeaway: <\/strong>Facebook ad headlines are not the focal point of the ad as with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/22\/google-ad-copy-mistakes\">Google ad copy<\/a>. The creative is the focal point, so it either needs to convey the message of the ad on its own; or be intriguing enough to get someone to read the headline.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f Want more Facebook advertising tips?<\/p>\n<p>Free guide &gt;&gt; <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">The 7 Facebook Advertising Fundamentals You Need to Succeed<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"painpoint\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Pain point-focused Facebook ad copy<\/h2>\n<p>Features and benefits are great, but speaking to the pain points in your ad that they solve is even better.

While it doesn&#8217;t have the social proof of the version above, it&#8217;s quicker and more memorable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd11 Takeaway: <\/strong>It all comes down to testing. I have no doubt that a major brand knows what it&#8217;s doing with its ads. These ad variations wouldn&#8217;t exist if they didn&#8217;t get results, so clearly, TT is doing its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\"> Facebook A\/B testing<\/a> homework.<\/p>\n<h3>After after<\/h3>\n<p>I have nothing against TT so I wanted to throw in a solid example of Facebook ad copy all around.

Incorporate those and your Facebook ad will stand out.<br \/>\n<a id=\"testimonial\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Testimonial Facebook ad copy<\/h2>\n<p>Given (1) <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how powerful online reviews are<\/a> and (2) the fact that testimonials are basically reviews on steroids, testimonial ad copy is the way to go.<\/p>\n<h3>Before<\/h3>\n<p>So I love this business&#8217;s approach with using a real customer and a DIY video (gives it more of a human and trustworthy feel), but I take issue with a few things. The ad reads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary text:<\/strong><em> What distinguishes [name] from other competitors? Quite simply, it is our experience, dependability, and commitment to 100% satisfaction guaranteed! Here&#8217;s what some of our customers have said about their experience.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Image text:<\/strong> <em>Shasta, Satisfied Customer<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline:<\/strong><em> Trusted AC &amp; Heating Experts for Over 65 Years!<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-examples-testimonial-video-ad.png\" alt=\"facebook ad copy examples - testimonial ad\" width=\"720\" height=\"609\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57016\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-examples-testimonial-video-ad.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-examples-testimonial-video-ad-480x406.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Problem #1: There is no testimonial ad copy. Yes, you&#8217;d hear it in the video, but you need captions or text overlays. Not only do 80% of Facebook users watch ads with the sound off, but also, the text overlay aids in memorability. I\u2019m more likely to remember that this customer\u2019s name is Shasta than anything she\u2019s saying in the video. Same with you?<\/p>\n<p>Problem #2: The primary text is cookie-cutter generic copy. The &#8220;experience, dependability, and commitment to 100% satisfaction guaranteed&#8221; could be more authentic with either more interesting words or simply more details like &#8220;65 years of experience&#8221; or &#8220;4.8 star rating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd11 Takeaway: <\/strong>Replace or modify generic words to write more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells#credible\">credible ad copy<\/a> and if you have a video, make sure its message can be conveyed without the sound on.<\/p>\n<h3>After<\/h3>\n<p>Now this is the way to do it. The primary text here is three <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">customer review<\/a> quotes. Nothing special, but much more effective than the generic statement in the above version.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary text:<\/strong> <em>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for better service.&#8221; \/\/ &#8220;<\/em><em>They explained everything and offered me lots of good advice.&#8221; \/\/ Very professional and caring. Excellent job!\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline:<\/strong> <em>Servicing Austin Since 1954<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-testimonial-with-quotes.png\" alt=\"facebook ad copy examples - testimonial ad with customer quotes\" width=\"720\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57017\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-testimonial-with-quotes.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/facebook-ad-copy-example-testimonial-with-quotes-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now the only problem is this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/24\/design-facebook-ads-free\">Facebook ad creative<\/a>. Smiling faces and high-quality images are good but the lower-quality video in the first ad is more real. And the headline still gives credibility but it&#8217;s less friendly and the 65 years feels stronger. Use this version&#8217;s primary text in the previous example, and we&#8217;d have a great Facebook ad.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd11 <strong>Takeaway:<\/strong> What your customers have to say about your business\u2014even if it&#8217;s simple\u2014 carries more weight and credibility than what you have to say about it.<br \/>\n<a id=\"repetition\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Repetition-style Facebook ad copy<\/h2>\n<p>Repetition is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">psychological copywriting technique<\/a> based on the mere exposure effect (and also common sense), but there&#8217;s a right and a wrong way to do it.<\/p>\n<h3>After<\/h3>\n<p>No mistake here. There is no &#8220;before&#8221; version because SoFi nails repetition in both of these Facebook ad examples. In this first one, we see perfect implementation of overt repetition in the ad&#8217;s creative:<\/p>\n<p><em>Want to bypass the fees?<br \/>\nNo origination fees.<br \/>\nNo pre-payment fees.<br \/>\nNo late fees. No joke.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The fly swatter in the image even has the word NO in it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ad-copy-example-sofi-no-fees-repetition.png\" alt=\"facebook ad copy example - repetition done right\" width=\"720\" height=\"592\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56669\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ad-copy-example-sofi-no-fees-repetition.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ad-copy-example-sofi-no-fees-repetition-480x395.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The repetition of &#8220;no&#8221; here helps make SoFi&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition <\/a>crystal clear while also lending to the ad\u2019s tone of empowering the customer. It just wouldn&#8217;t have the same feel if it had been written like this:<\/p>\n<p><em>No origination, pre-payment, or late fees. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Or<\/p>\n<p><em>With SoFi, you can bypass:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>-Origination fees<br \/>\n-Pre-payment fees<br \/>\n-Late fees<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Would you agree?<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd11 <strong>Takeaway:<\/strong> If you&#8217;re going to use repetition, go all-in so that it makes a bold statement rather than appearing uncreative or lazy.<\/p>\n<h3>After after<\/h3>\n<p>So there\u2019s redundancy, when repetition feels unnecessary or lazy, and then there&#8217;s consistency, when repetition is artfully done. And SoFi comes in for the win with this second no-fee Facebook ad example.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary text:<\/strong> <em>Fees are a waste of money.
