Take advantage of the promotion area in YouTube Studio<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/20\/youtube-studio-reports\">YouTube Studio<\/a> offers a dedicated area for promoting your videos. Here\u2019s how you can use it to your advantage:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Promotions tab:<\/strong> Within YouTube Studio, you\u2019ll find the Promotions tab. This feature allows you to advertise your videos without needing to create a campaign directly in Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Easy setup:<\/strong> The Promotions feature simplifies the process, enabling you to set up ads directly from YouTube Studio. You can select your video, define your audience, set your budget, and launch your campaign in just a few steps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Targeted reach:<\/strong> Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/29\/youtube-display-ads\">detailed targeting options<\/a> to reach your desired audience by country and language. This ensures your videos get seen by the right people, maximizing engagement and growth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance insights:<\/strong> Track the performance of your promotions directly within YouTube Studio. Monitor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/03\/underrated-youtube-metrics\">key metrics<\/a> like views, watch time, and engagement to assess the effectiveness of your video advertising efforts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-studio-promotion-goal.webp\" alt=\"youtube studio promotion options\" width=\"558\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86913\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-studio-promotion-goal.webp 558w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-studio-promotion-goal-480x516.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see in this example, in the Promotions tab in YouTube Studio, you can now launch a campaign to boost the reach of any of your uploaded clips, via simplified set-up and targeting options.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube Promotions are available for all channels that meet the requirements for Advanced features and have more than 1,000 subscribers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZqVAQ2mb-xQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As explained by YouTube<\/a>: <em>&#8220;Creators have used promotions to grow views and subscribers faster, get more views on content where they showcase a product or service, with a goal of increasing sales, or to reach a specific audience, such as a new country.

Track ad performance and audience engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Engaging with your audience is crucial. You&#8217;ve worked hard to cultivate a community, so when someone asks you a question, it&#8217;s not only nice to answer it, but it also shows others that you&#8217;re there to help. When my channel got its first comment, I was excited. Now that my channel has over 16,000 subscribers, I still (try to) answer every question or comment I get. I want to be helpful and let others know I&#8217;m here to help. After all, I did this to educate and inspire, and a little engagement helps with brand awareness and recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Regularly analyzing your channel&#8217;s performance is essential for continuous improvement. Here\u2019s how to do it:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>YouTube Analytics<\/strong>: Use YouTube Analytics to track key metrics such as watch time, audience retention, and subscriber growth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Ads reports<\/strong>: If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-advertising-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running YouTube ads<\/a>, utilize Google Ads reports to measure ad performance and ROI.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Feedback loop<\/strong>: Collect feedback from your audience through comments and surveys to understand their preferences.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Additionally, you should analyze where viewers stop watching and understand why. Identify which videos are gaining you subscribers; YouTube Studio&#8217;s Analytics and Advanced Mode can show you this quite clearly. See the image below for an example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp\" alt=\"youtube analytics example\" width=\"850\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86914\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/track-youtube-audience-engagement-480x237.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Try to create more content similar to what has been working well and use the data from viewing behavior to improve your videos. This approach also serves as a very effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/outdated-seo-tactics\">SEO strategy<\/a>, as making videos that answer someone&#8217;s search query can drive more views.<\/p>\n<div id=\"pay-attention-to-organic-youtube-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Optimize your organic video content<\/h3>\n<p>This tip isn\u2019t necessarily going to boost your YouTube ads performance, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/youtube-seo\">optimizing your organic video content<\/a> is key to attracting and retaining viewers you get from YouTube ads.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create compelling thumbnails: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/07\/youtube-thumbnail\">Create attention-grabbing YouTube thumbnails<\/a> that reflect the content of your video. I like to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fotor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fotor<\/a>, as it&#8217;s great for those who don&#8217;t have Photoshop skills or those who have Photoshop skills but are not efficient with it and like an easier way (like me). With Fotor, you can easily remove backgrounds from images, make visually appealing text overlays, and even figure out your channel&#8217;s style. Their vast library of thumbnail templates is proven to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\">increase click-through rates<\/a> (CTR), making it an invaluable resource for optimizing your content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Write SEO-friendly descriptions and titles: <\/strong>Write detailed descriptions with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/07\/ppc-keyword-challenges\">relevant keywords<\/a> to improve searchability. For titles, providing an answer to someone&#8217;s question (you anticipate they&#8217;ll ask) is a great idea.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use engaging introductions:<\/strong> Start your videos with engaging introductions to hook viewers from the beginning.\n<ul>\n<li>Something like: &#8220;Hey everyone! Welcome back to our channel. Today, we&#8217;re diving into the top five strategies to skyrocket your YouTube growth. If you&#8217;re ready to boost your channel and reach new heights, you&#8217;re in the right place. Let&#8217;s get started!&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Summarize your video: <\/strong>Summing up a video is important for reinforcing the main points and providing closure, which can be challenging. Ending a video effectively can keep viewers engaged and more likely to return for future content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include clear calls to action:<\/strong> Include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">clear calls to action<\/a>, such as asking viewers to like, comment, and subscribe. This helps increase engagement and grow your audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Optimizing your video content helps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel\">improve your channel\u2019s visibility<\/a> and encourages viewer interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you should check out the inspiration tab in YouTube Studio. Go to Analytics and then to Inspiration. Here, you can see what people are searching for on YouTube who watch your videos. This is a good way to cater to your existing viewers.<\/p>\n<p>When I was early on in my YouTube channel, I didn&#8217;t have many ideas other than creating videos about conversion tracking and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/14\/how-to-use-google-tag-manager\">Google Tag Manager<\/a>. I needed more video ideas and had to keep up my goal of putting out at least one video a week. So, I checked out this inspiration area, and it showed me that people were searching for &#8220;how to create a Gmail account.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;easy enough,&#8221; and created a video (a screen share) showing people how to create a Gmail account.<\/p>\n<p>I titled it &#8220;<strong>How to Create a Gmail Account &#8211; Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners <\/strong><strong>\ud83d\udce5 #gmail #google #digital.<\/strong>&#8221; This title, along with the appropriate icon and tags, was not just fluff. It actually became my best-performing video for a long period, racking up over 30,000 views organically in a short time. You can see the uptick in views in YouTube Studio when it was indexed by Google.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-analytics-example.webp\" alt=\"example of youtube boosted performance after indexing on google\" width=\"872\" height=\"504\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86915\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-analytics-example.webp 872w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/youtube-analytics-example-480x277.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Make your YouTube ads view-worthy<\/h2>\n<p>To sum up, growing and optimizing your YouTube channel requires a strategic approach that leverages both content creation and promotional tools.
