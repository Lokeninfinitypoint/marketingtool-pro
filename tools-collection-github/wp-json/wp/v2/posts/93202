ChatGPT (OpenAI)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT<\/a> is one of the most well-known and widely used AI solutions. The chat-based tool can assist with a wide range of tasks, including writing, coding, brainstorming, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/05\/chatgpt-seo\"> SEO<\/a>. It\u2019s incredibly versatile, and while you\u2019re focusing on using AI for productivity, it\u2019s worth exploring how ChatGPT can also speed up your other tasks in your day-to-day routine.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1.webp\" alt=\"AI productivity tools - screenshot from Chatgpt\" width=\"866\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93220 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1.webp 866w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>ChatGPT, like other chat-based tools, works by feeding it prompts. We\u2019ve curated a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\"> list of prompts<\/a> you can try to get started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT pricing: <\/strong>ChatGPT offers a robust free version that anyone can use, while its paid subscriptions start at $20 per month.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Notion AI<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Notion AI<\/a> is a workspace that can automatically generate content inside Notion pages\u2014from meeting notes to action items\u2014and allows you to search your knowledge base. It also helps build workflows within Notion, for example, creating pages, task trackers, and calendars for a new product or marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion.webp\" alt=\"AI productivity tools - screenshot from Notion\" width=\"688\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93221 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion.webp 688w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion-480x419.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 688px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is great if you\u2019re already a Notion user. And if you\u2019re looking for a solution for documentation creation, storage, and access, then Notion could be a great solution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notion pricing:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.com\/pricing\">Notion has a free plan<\/a>, and its paid plans start at $10 per month.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><\/strong>15. Reclaim.ai<\/h3>\n<p>Now, this is similar to the calendar tools, but we\u2019re putting it here because of its singular mission: <a href=\"http:\/\/reclaim.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reclaim.ai <\/a>\u00a0automatically blocks time for habits, tasks, and meetings based on your goals and availability. And even better, Reclaim will help you track your time so that you can review your patterns\u2014and stay honest and accountable.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim.webp\" alt=\"AI productivity tools - screenshot from Reclaim\" width=\"879\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93222 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim.webp 879w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim-480x328.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/reclaim.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re automating and leveraging AI tools to get more productive, you don\u2019t want to lose control over those newly gained work blocks. The only drawback to note here is that, at least for now, Reclaim.ai only integrates with Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reclaim pricing:<\/strong> You can use Reclaim\u2019s Lite plan for free, and the paid plans start at $8 per month.<\/p>\n<h2>Start using these AI tools for productivity<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re busy, and sometimes it feels like you\u2019re too busy to start testing out new workflows or tools when you need to get things done. But if you can invest a little time to stand up one AI productivity tool, it\u2019ll free up enough time to try another, and possibly another. Then, all of a sudden, you have lots of time back in your day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take your productivity to the next level with these AI productivity
