Google may reach billions of users between the display network and the 3.5 billion daily searches on the platform, but there\u2019s no way that everyone online is equally likely to be your next customer.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, Google has introduced a number of different solutions such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">search remarketing<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/12\/demographic-targeting-for-search-campaigns\">demographic targeting<\/a>, and recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/31\/in-market-audiences-for-search\">In-Market audiences<\/a> to help advertisers reach the right audience online. Advertisers should be pleasantly surprised to hear that Google recently silently snuck in a few new ways to target their best audiences online.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s newest Detailed Demographics targeting option enables you to target your campaigns to different users based on their Education, Marital Status, Homeowner Status, or Parental Status. Advertisers can use this new data to create bid adjustments for different demographics, exclude demographics from seeing their ads, or even exclusively target a highly coveted demographic in their search campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0dd698e7-f3d1-4211-9ee4-d79f82d1f5c6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-detailed-demographics.jpg\" alt=\"google adwords detailed demographics\" width=\"750\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>A Look Inside Google\u2019s New Detailed Demographics<\/h2>\n<p>Google has introduced four new detailed demographic targets:<\/p>\n<h3>Parental Status<\/h3>\n<p>Google first started giving <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/20\/adwords-parental-status\">display advertisers control over targeting parents<\/a> back in 2014. This new audience not only extends that targeting over to search campaigns\u2014additionally, we now have more visibility into the age of those parents\u2019 children. Knowing this detailed demographic information can be key, as common searches like \u201cmath tutor\u201d or \u201cboy\u2019s coat\u201d might have very different implications to the parent of a 16-year-old versus the parent of a 6-year-old.<\/p>\n<p>The new detailed demographic targets for parental status include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents of Infants (0-1 years)<\/li>\n<li>Parents of Toddlers (1-3 years)<\/li>\n<li>Parents of Preschoolers (4-5 years)<\/li>\n<li>Parents of Grade schoolers (6 -12 years)<\/li>\n<li>Parents of Teens (13 \u2013 17 years)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth remembering that Google does not allow you to target your ads directly toward minors of any age. However, as any child may lament to you, their parents are often the key decision maker in their lives and control most of their purchasing power. Targeting the parents of your younger consumers may prove to be a viable strategy to drive more sales or conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>Marital Status<\/h3>\n<p>If 2017 taught me anything, it\u2019s that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/29\/adwords-life-events-targeting\">getting married<\/a> changes everything (in a good way, Bobby!). Being in a relationship means I\u2019m now always shopping for two, and I might not always be the key or only decision maker in my own purchases anymore. Google\u2019s detailed demographics targeting now allows advertisers to target users who are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single<\/li>\n<li>In a relationship<\/li>\n<li>Married<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"82c07599-fbbd-4a3b-a34d-7a344ea63c3b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marriage-status-detailed-demographics.jpg\" alt=\"google ads marital status targeting\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>I\u2019m always going to sneak this picture into my blog posts.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Education<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s new detailed demographics options enable the targeting of users based on both their current student status and educational attainment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current College Students<\/li>\n<li>High School Graduates<\/li>\n<li>Obtained Bachelor\u2019s Degree<\/li>\n<li>Obtained Advanced Degree<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, the $82 billion back-to-school market has a lot to gain from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/26\/marketing-strategies-college-students\">making the most of these college students.<\/a> As do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/04\/higher-education-marketing\">higher educational institutions<\/a> who may be looking to attract high school graduates or bachelor\u2019s degree holders into their programs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b9dd76ba-9bfe-40be-b837-909901e3c28e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/recently-graduated-life-event-targeting.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"825\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Beyond the obvious though, educational attainment is commonly shown to be correlated to numerous other aspects of our lives \u2013 it can serve as an indicator to our professional career status, our income, and even how we identify politically. Although Google doesn\u2019t allow us to target these aspects directly, advertisers may discover valuable insights by observing these demographics for differences in performance.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, students are known to have unusual search behavior since they often turn to Google to begin their research. And while that may be convenient for them, students are seldom known to either have a surplus of disposable income or intent to purchase costly items or services. Many advertisers may benefit from excluding current students from their ads\u2019 targeting.<\/p>\n<h2>Homeowner Status<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s new detailed demographics options also allow advertisers to target:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homeowners<\/li>\n<li>Renters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And while that may sound simple \u2013 the number of purchases that come with homeownership are vast. Maytag refrigerator? Insurance? Home painting? Lawncare? No thank you, I\u2019m going to rent until I die, but you might want to target my landlord.<\/p>\n<p>Avocado toast? I\u2019m your audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Google\u2019s New Detailed Demographics<\/h2>\n<p>Applying detailed demographics to your search campaign or ad group is simple, if you know where to look. Google buried this treasure in the \u201cAudiences\u201d (not demographics, Google?) tab within Google Ads. From there, you\u2019ll be able to add these detailed demographics for Parental Status, Marital Status, Education, and Homeowner Status to your search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Here, advertisers have the option to either \u201cTarget\u201d these audiences and exclusively show ads to them or add them as an \u201cObservation\u201d audience to see how these audiences engage with their ads and adjust their bids for these users.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\"
