Anyway, it\u2019s super time-consuming to have to put it in quotes every time. Zero Search Results. That\u2019s the name.<\/p>\n<p>Zero Search Results was an experiment performed by Google from about March 13 to March 20. The purpose was to eliminate multiple search results for queries that, theoretically, didn\u2019t need them. If you were coming back from a west coast trip, for instance, and were wondering what time it was back on the east coast, you would search \u201ctime est\u201d and see this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"03484dcd-cbbf-4882-a754-17fd6f258487\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results2.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Time Query\" width=\"1614\" height=\"820\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If in fact you were searching for some obscure 90s band called Time Est, or if you meant to embark on a Timex watch online shopping spree, you\u2019d be sorely disappointed, or annoyed. That \u201cShow all results\u201d button would be an entirely new and separate button you\u2019d have to click. Pain in the ass, right? I know. We\u2019ll get into that shortly.<\/p>\n<p>Once clicked, the button would reveal a standard Google search page, a la:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1300f13b-918f-43dd-89e6-db4ee3aba45c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results3.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Time Query 2\" width=\"1573\" height=\"1403\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Other \u201csimple\u201d queries, like those involving calculations or unit conversions, would show similar none-results:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7f544bf5-9f60-43a8-b6a2-3d23a2593292\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results4.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Distance Query\" width=\"800\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As Google never made an official announcement, there was naturally a fair bit of chatter among SEOs\u2014what was the point of all this? Danny Sullivan of Google provided the answer via Twitter:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10fe5007-8f90-4128-a0fe-b07c5ed838da\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results5.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Danny Sullivan\" width=\"629\" height=\"466\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Awesome. Condensed view means faster load time. Faster load time means more efficiency. Nothing novel, but seemed like a promising concept. Sullivan went on to Tweet that Zero Search Results could diminish load times by as much as half a second. Seems pretty negligible, but it\u2019s actually not\u2014especially when you\u2019re in an area in which load times naturally increase (like on a plane, for instance, where you could very realistically make that \u201ctime est\u201d query.)<\/p>\n<p>Initial rollouts received enough of a positive response that Google felt comfortable releasing Zero Search Results globally. They even provided a \u201cSend feedback\u201d panel at the bottom of Zero Search Results pages to collect miscellaneous tidbits of user experience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6eedc8e6-143b-411d-ada8-e82a0067dadf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results6_0.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Feedback\" width=\"626\" height=\"574\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And of course, because Google is Google, it could monitor the efficacy of the experiment based on how often the \u201cShow all results\u201d button was being clicked, and for which queries.<\/p>\n<h2>What were the results?<\/h2>\n<p>As quickly as it came, Zero Search Results was gone. Google received a lot of pushback early on from SEOs worried about a \u201cslippery slope\u201d\u2014i.e., what would happen if Google expanded Zero Search Results to queries that, under normal circumstances, would generate meaningful traffic for a wide array of brands? To revisit our earlier plane example: say flight queries started only returning Google Flights featured snippets. Brands like Kayak and Expedia would stand to lose serious amounts of traffic and revenue.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bab37c1e-b005-47fa-ab6b-0629bb7c5029\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"887\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Another nail in the proverbial \u201cSEO is dead\u201d coffin, right?<\/p>\n<p>The experiment also caused a fair bit of user confusion in its first global thrust. Barry Schwartz points out a couple oversights in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/video-03-16-2018-25417.html\">this Search Engine RoundTable post<\/a>\u2014first, the elimination of Time Magazine from search results returned for the query, \u201ctime\u201d; and second, folks just looking for a hot \u201cdate in London\u201d receiving a featured snippet featuring the calendar date in London. These are both cases where Google would be getting the true intent of the query wrong.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"32720a7a-8b08-47bc-9757-51475eee30ff\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results10.jpg\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Date\" width=\"830\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In Google\u2019s defense, if you\u2019re really looking for a date, there has to be a better way.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also notice the ads in the above Zero SERP. This and other examples of SERPs exclusively populated by ads were brought to Google\u2019s attention, with many wondering about the potential implications to paid search. Why wouldn\u2019t Google just disable ads on Zero Search Results pages?<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, SERPs like the one pictured above were not deliberate. Google Search Quality Analyst Nathan Johns went as far as to call them \u201cedge cases\u201d\u2014i.e., unintended bugs in the system:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e9583ca0-37ce-49bf-a539-64e4c74c9105\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-zero-search-results11.png\" alt=\"Google Zero Search Results Nathan Johns\" width=\"636\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While Google fixed most of these initial oversights, and while it (mostly Danny Sullivan) managed to quell the groundswell of \u201cslippery slope\u201d concern via Twitter\u2014Google would <em>not <\/em>be expanding Zero Search Results outside of local time, unit conversions, and calculations\u2014the experiment could ultimately not survive the amount of user error and vocal pushback it received. Danny sounded the death knell on March 20.

Certainly! Do we want to? Ehhhh\u2014the answer gets a bit dicier. Quicker and more relevant search results are unquestionably good for users. Zero Search Results will stick if Google can find a way to reimplement it without sacrificing efficiency for intent. There\u2019s a niche of queries out there for which Zero Search Results are perfectly suited, and Google now has the data to find it.<\/p>\n<p>Still, questions remain. Danny Sullivan himself stated that this update was all about speed\u2014but there\u2019s no ostensible benefit to hiding search results from users unless the featured snippets are <em>exactly <\/em>what they\u2019re looking for, and unless they load faster. Can Google nail down an algorithm that\u2019s accurate enough and smart enough to keep up with the complexities of user intent as it evolves? There\u2019s no doubting the intent behind \u201c52 divided by 6\u201d\u2014it\u2019s calculation. But what if some chic Thai fusion joint called 52\/6 pops up in New York City next week at the intersection of 52nd and 6th?<\/p>\n<p>Sounds like it\u2019d have great tempura.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an algorithm update that took effect March 13, Google undertook an experiment to deliver a single featured snippet for queries that didn\u2019t demand full search results pages\u2014i.e., \u201czero search results.\u201d After just a week of live testing, the grand experiment has come to a close.
