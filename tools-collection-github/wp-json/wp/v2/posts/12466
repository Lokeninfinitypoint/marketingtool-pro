If you want to stand out from your competitors and attract more followers, pay close attention to the Instagram feed and make it eye-catching, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tjmccue\/2013\/01\/08\/what-is-an-infographic-and-ways-to-make-it-go-viral\/#157ce2027272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65% of people are visual learners<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Plus, 72% of Millennials and Gen X share their photos on social media while traveling, so it\u2019s no wonder that 67% of people claim that the Instagrammability of a location is the most important factor when choosing a holiday destination, as specified in one study by <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.expedia.com\/2017-07-10-au-Travelling-off-the-grammed-track\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Expedia<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.travolution.com\/articles\/102216\/survey-highlights-instagram-as-key-factor-in-destination-choice-among-millennials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40.1% of young travelers<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> choose a holiday destination by how \u201cInstagrammable\u201d it will be.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This means that it\u2019s important to showcase destinations to inspire travelers, and STA Travel is a good example of using UGC photos to create a beautiful and cohesive Instagram feed. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-sta-travel.png\" alt=\"sta travel Instagram feed\" width=\"729\" height=\"840\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/statravel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re a travel blogger who sells digital downloads like filters, having a beautiful Instagram feed is a way to show off your product and encourage followers to give it a try. Here\u2019s an example:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-pilot-madeleine.png\" alt=\"pilot madeleine Instagram feed\" width=\"640\" height=\"774\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pilotmadeleine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The good news for companies that sell services for tourists: To create a cohesive Instagram feed, there\u2019s no need to have many photos. You can split photos into tiles to create a mosaic effect that helps to organize your feed and make it more eye-catching. And a great example of image splitting done right is Share Now:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-sharenow.png\" alt=\"Sharenow Instagram feed\" width=\"653\" height=\"637\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sharenow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">No matter what helps you create beautiful visual content for your Instagram feed, whether you publish user-generated content, take your photos, or repurpose royalty-free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/22\/best-practices-stock-photos\">stock photos<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. The main idea is to use visual content to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.depositphotos.com\/how-to-use-photography-to-influence-consumer-behavior.html\">create a good first impression<\/a> on your visitors and keep your followers interested in your profile. All in all, it helps to grow your following.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Key takeaway:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Having a cohesive Instagram feed is a proven way to grab your target audience&#8217;s attention, turn visitors into followers, and inspire travelers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lesson #2: Social proof builds loyalty and trust<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">With a choice overload on the market, brand loyalty and trust is what makes your company any different from other competitors that hope for the attention of your target audience. Moreover, travelers <a href=\"https:\/\/stackla.com\/resources\/reports\/bridging-the-gap-consumer-marketing-perspectives-on-content-in-the-digital-age\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rely on authentic social proof<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> for inspiration and validation when planning travel.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Travelers pay close attention to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust signals<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, so they watch travel vlogs, read customer reviews, and seek out personal recommendations before they book. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/digital\/social-media-and-travel-go-hand-in-hand-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">52% of social media users<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> draw travel inspiration directly from their friends&#8217; photos. Thus, travel companies need to use social proof on Instagram, and there are many ways to do it.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, Outdoor Research, a company that sells technical apparel and gear for outdoor sports, collaborates with niche influencers to provide social proof, and it gives wonderful results. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.talkable.com\/#case_studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">case study from Talkable<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, setting up a referral program has helped Outdoor Research achieve a 600% return on investment and a 17% advocacy rate. Here\u2019s how the company uses influencers\u2019 photos on Instagram:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-outdoorresearch.png\" alt=\"outdoor research Instagram feed\" width=\"742\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B48AGvVh_m3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Another great example of social proof comes from Airy Indonesia as the company uses Instagram Stories to share customer feedback with potential travelers. With over <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/\">500 million accounts<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> that use Instagram Stories daily, not only is it a great place to reach your target audience but it also helps to provide social proof without clogging the main feed up. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Airy Indonesia also adds room reviews to a separate Instagram Stories highlights album that appears right below the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\">bio section<\/a> and makes it easier for visitors and followers to read customer feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-airy-indonesia.jpg\" alt=\"Airy Indonesia Instagram story\" width=\"752\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/18057417139090029\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Knowing some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/04\/instagram-story-hacks\">Instagram Story hacks<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> for better engagement, the company writes the name of the room, adds a quote, and includes a clickable link that takes interested followers to the website page and tells more about the featured room. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And if you want to cause a buzz around your product and give your customers a solid reason to spread the word about your company on Instagram, it\u2019s important to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">referral rewards<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Here\u2019s how one travel blogger shares her thoughts on using Booking.com referral codes:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-referal-codes.png\" alt=\"travel marketing instagram post with referral codes in caption\" width=\"512\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beyondbabeesh\/p\/BsnxtIZFZAR\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since people use social media to share their customer experiences with other consumers, it doesn\u2019t take much time or effort for modern customers to do research before choosing your travel company. And if you want to stay ahead of your competitors, provide your Instagram visitors and followers with social proof to increase brand loyalty and trust. From publishing user-generated content to featuring customer feedback via Instagram Stories, there are many ways to share social proof on Instagram. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Key takeaway:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> When you share social proof on Instagram, you ease the worried mind of potential travelers that helps to build brand trust, add credibility for your business, and simplify customer\u2019s buying decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lesson #3: In-app shopping is flourishing<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The popularity of Instagram shopping is on the rise. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Business<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, 60% of Instagrammers discover new products or services on the platform and 130 million accounts tap on shopping posts to learn more about products every month. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since users are ready to buy products in-app, Instagram rolls out business-specific features like product tags and shoppable stickers, \u201cBook\u201d and \u201cReserve\u201d action buttons, and clickable Instagram Stories links to improve customer experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For travel companies, this also means that their potential customers are ready to book travel on Instagram, so it\u2019s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\">start selling in-app<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, and Ryanair is a great example of this strategy in action. In honor of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company offered a whole week of incredible deals, and it promoted its deals on Instagram:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-ryanair.png\" alt=\"Ryan Air Instagram bio\" width=\"743\" height=\"281\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ryanair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Not only did Ryanair create a brand hashtag and use its Instagram bio to inform visitors and followers about the time-limited deals, but it also wrote a series of Instagram posts that drove intrigue and engagement:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-ryanair_announcement.png\" alt=\"Ryan Air Instagram post\" width=\"745\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B5M-Dftqpz2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Instagram shopping is not only for brands that sell physical products; when done right, it also helps to sell travel through Instagram. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Key takeaway:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> With a variety of business-specific features on Instagram, it\u2019s easier for travelers to discover and book their travel experiences in-app. If you want to turn your Instagram followers into customers, optimize your Instagram account for shopping, improve the customer journey, and encourage urgent purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lesson #4: Excellent customer service is a must<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Over the last few years, customer service expectations have changed. The days when travelers would contact a traveler hotline are far behind us. Modern customers use social media platforms like Instagram to share their customer experiences and get their requests solved. One <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/data\/q3-2017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprout Social report<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> says that 46% of customers have used social media to connect with brands and 55% expect to get a resolution or response on social media.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you work in the travel industry, you should be ready to manage a barrage of satisfied and dissatisfied customers on Instagram. Let\u2019s take Skyscanner \u2019s story, for example. Customers often share their pain points in the comment section, so the company has to solve their requests quickly to meet their expectations and prove potential travelers that their company is worth choosing<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-skyscanner.png\" alt=\"skyskanner Instagram post\" width=\"794\" height=\"509\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bw9FSMODj-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But, if you realize that you can&#8217;t meet customer service expectations, it&#8217;s better to provide your visitors followers with an alternative way to contact your customer support team, like how Air France does below.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/travel-marketing-on-instagram-airfrance.png\" alt=\"Air France Instagram bio\" width=\"770\" height=\"243\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/airfrance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Because modern customers often turn to social media platforms to share their experiences with other people in order to help them make the right purchase choice, providing excellent customer support on Instagram isn\u2019t an option these days. Moreover, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/RightNow\/2011-customer-experience-impact-report\/5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73% of customers<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> say that friendly service is a deciding factor in \u201cfalling in love\u201d with a brand. In other words, when you listen to your customers and answer their questions, you stay ahead of your competitors and win more loyal customers.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Key takeaway:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> To increase customer satisfaction and give your customers a solid reason to choose your company over competitors, it\u2019s important to provide excellent customer support on Instagram: Read comments, analyze direct messages, and monitor brand mentions to solve customer requests fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Set your travel Instagram up for success<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Modern customers are fond of traveling and they often turn to Instagram to discover new destinations, draw inspiration for vacations, and buy or book travel. Since traveling is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.sellfy.com\/instagram-niches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most profitable Instagram niches<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, it\u2019s no wonder that travel companies want to make the most out of using Instagram marketing.
