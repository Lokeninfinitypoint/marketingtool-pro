First of all, when it&#8217;s delivered in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/23\/thank-you-page-examples\">thank you page<\/a> or thank you email, it confirms for them that their order is, indeed complete. Checkout processes are always more than one click, so this is important.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it is your chance to actually express gratitude. Not the generic &#8220;thanks for being a valued customer&#8221; but the actual gratitude you feel, as a small business, when someone supports you. And this can be expressed in the copy you use for your confirmation emails and pages, but also in thank you for your order cards that you may want to include in your packaging.<\/p>\n<p>There is an infinite number of ways to say thank you for your order, but here are your rules of thumb:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it short.<\/strong> Twitter length (360 characters) is best.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include a CTA. <\/strong>This is optional.
