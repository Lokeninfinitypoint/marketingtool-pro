Within the span of a year, generative AI went from a niche interest to a pop culture phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>It should come as little surprise that marketers are using AI in every facet possible, from content ideation to research and beyond. The growth and change of AI shows no signs of slowing down, so it goes without saying that marketing use cases for AI will shift significantly in the coming months and years as well.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why today, we\u2019re exploring the top AI marketing trends of 2024:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#ai-ad-targeting\">Further refinement of ad targeting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improved-ai-marketing-automation\">Improved AI marketing automation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#more-capable-ai-chatbots\">More capable chatbots<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#more-use-of-predictive-analytics\">More use of predictive analytics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improved-research-and-decision-making\">Improved research and decision-making<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#continued-adoption-voice-based-shopping\">Continued adoption of voice-based shopping<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#use-of-multimodal-ai\">More use of multimodal AI<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Top AI marketing trends for 2024<\/h2>\n<p>Get a deeper dive into each AI trend and find out what it means for your marketing strategy this year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-ad-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Further refinement of ad targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Many marketers are using AI for improved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/31\/facebook-audience-targeting\">ad targeting<\/a>. Artificial intelligence can parse through large sets of audience data, and then help you tweak your ad targeting and messaging. Expect to see this AI marketing trend continue and evolve in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>This could result in more accurate ads but also a higher bar for what constitutes a successful ad. For marketers, this means focusing more on quality and ensuring your ads aren\u2019t missing the mark.<\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Increased competitor and overall use of AI for ad targeting begs the question: will consumers become more ad savvy and scrutinous?<\/p>\n<p>While you don\u2019t have to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/30\/ai-impact-on-ppc\">AI for improved targeting<\/a> now, keep in mind consumers could become more scrutinous of ads and expect even more refined messaging. Track the performance of your ads even more closely and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/11\/copywriting-ab-tests\">A\/B test<\/a>\u00a0messaging until you feel it\u2019s as targeted as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Speaking of ads, want to make sure yours are hitting the mark? Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">free Google Ads Grader<\/a> for an instant audit of your account.<\/p>\n<div id=\"improved-ai-marketing-automation\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Improved AI marketing automation<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing automation is all the rage, from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/08\/write-emails-like-a-human\">automated email sends<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/programmatic-advertising\">programmatic advertising<\/a>. Expect to see this technology continue evolving and advancing. This could result in the ability to pivot quicker, run more micro-campaigns, feasibly deliver to smaller segments, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Increased use of AI-powered marketing automation could result in audience demands shifting. People may grow to expect more timely campaigns, more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">niche segmentation<\/a>, and content that\u2019s even more hyper-personalized.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt prompt subject line personalization\" width=\"936\" height=\"329\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71554\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization-480x169.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Factor the aforementioned audience demand shifts into your content ideation as you brainstorm campaigns in the coming quarters. Automation powered by AI could allow you to pepper in smaller campaigns, so think about any potential <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-pain-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pain points<\/a> or topics you could target with these size efforts. How could automating social post scheduling or email sends free you up to work on other efforts?<\/p>\n<div id=\"more-capable-ai-chatbots\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. More capable chatbots<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/13\/chatbot-examples\">Chatbots<\/a> are capable of so much more than acting as a stand-in lead capture form. (Although they\u2019re great at that, too.)<\/p>\n<p>Recent advances in AI are allowing chatbots to answer more nuanced customer questions, including those about products and services. This makes it possible for chatbots to guide visitors through your site, and ultimately through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>More and more companies will likely start adopting advanced chatbots that can answer more niche questions. If you\u2019re not already, now\u2019s a great time to implement your own advanced chatbot. This will help you stay ahead of the competition and give you a better chance at staying competitive.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg\" alt=\"brand messaging - example of brand messaging in live chat\" width=\"537\" height=\"634\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76903\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg 537w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-example-live-chat-480x567.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Think about your content strategy for your chatbot. Not only what your chatbot will say, but also what kind of content you have on your site that it can send to users when they ask certain questions.<\/p>\n<p>Check your chatbot logs as time goes on and see what kinds of questions people are asking, and whether they\u2019re getting the help they need. If there are clear gaps, write content that your chatbot can then guide people to, ensuring those knowledge gaps are filled and people\u2019s needs are met.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\uddd0 Are you using AI the right way?

More use of predictive analytics<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/07\/google-analytics-4-event-tracking\">Predictive analytics<\/a> allows marketers to analyze customer data to predict the market, as well as customer actions. While this technology isn\u2019t new, it\u2019s getting more capable each year.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely AI will continue expanding predictive capabilities, allowing for more accurate predictions, better product recommendations, and more. For example, advanced predictive analytics will allow companies to forecast sales, predict how pieces could perform based on select audiences and terms, and even which products might perform better in a campaign.<\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Rich, historical customer and site data are crucial for accurate predictive analytics. Set yourself up for success and make sure you\u2019re capturing the right data now, whether you\u2019re using predictive analytics or not. This way, you\u2019ll have all the historical data you need to hit the ground running with predictive analytics the moment you find the right solution for your organization.<\/p>\n<div id=\"improved-research-and-decision-making\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Improved research and decision-making<\/h3>\n<p>For smaller businesses, research is often difficult and time-consuming. This puts smaller businesses at a disadvantage when compared to larger organizations with entire teams dedicated to research. Fortunately, the days of manual research and hindered decision-making are behind us all.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd2b Psst. Speaking of research. Want to expedite your keyword research process? Make sure you check out our handy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">free keyword research tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Advanced AI is capable of assisting with numerous forms of marketing research, from answering quick questions about a content topic to quickly describing how various tools perform. This can help smaller companies expedite the research process, make more informed decisions, and even quickly vet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\">various tools<\/a> they\u2019re examining.<\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s a safe bet that AI will continue to advance in these capabilities in 2024. This will make it even more feasible for smaller companies to keep up with larger companies. This is great news for you, especially if you\u2019re running a lean team. But, this also means competition will become fiercer as time goes on, as it will be a truly level playing field.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not already familiar with AI tools, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\">ChatGPT<\/a> or Jasper, start learning them ASAP. See how you can use them to help streamline various marketing research processes to keep from falling behind in 2024. And of course, continue to focus on quality above all else, and fact-check anything you get from any AI tool!<\/p>\n<div id=\"continued-adoption-voice-based-shopping\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Continued adoption of voice-based shopping<\/h3>\n<p>As AI continues to advance, the capabilities of voice-based search will as well. Even in 2022, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/5406\/voice-commerce-in-the-united-states\/#editorsPicks\">27%<\/a> of US-based consumers used voice search to make payments. Gone are the days of only using voice to search for the answers to important questions, like, \u201cHow do I know when the cheese in the back of the fridge is bad?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The continued adoption of voice-based shopping and searching will likely force marketers to base much of their strategy around the voice-based experience. If 27% of US-based consumers used voice for payment two years ago, the number will likely go up and up. Before long, voice-based payment and shopping will be the expected norm.<\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Create content focused on even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">longer-tail keywords<\/a> that one would ask out loud in a voice search. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">Voice SEO<\/a> is already on the radar for some, but not all companies. Creating content that\u2019s tailored to the voice-search experience now will help set you up for success as AI allows for more and more refined voice-based shopping and searching.<\/p>\n<div id=\"use-of-multimodal-ai\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. More use of multimodal AI<\/h3>\n<p>Multimodal AI combines numerous inputs, including text and visuals, to deliver a more complete experience. This is opposed to other forms of AI that only pull from text or images or voice, rather than a combination. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/05\/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing\">Generative AI<\/a> is a prime example of multimodal AI, as many platforms are capable of creating content and visuals in one swoop.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets.webp\" alt=\"google ads ai automatically created assets example\" width=\"796\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78265\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets.webp 796w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets-480x362.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Automatically created assets is just one multimodal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/04\/google-ads-ai\">AI feature available in Google Ads<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As multimodal AI technology grows in capabilities and adoption, more and more companies will be capable of outputting higher volumes of copy and visuals. This technology will also allow companies to have even more refined keyword and ad targeting as well.<\/p>\n<p>The end result? Smaller companies that can compete with larger content teams.<\/p>\n<h4>What this means for you<\/h4>\n<p>Whether or not you\u2019re using multimodal AI, there\u2019s a good chance your competitors are. Don\u2019t hesitate to use generative AI to brainstorm content ideas and supply your team with jumping-off points. But, make sure you have a vetting process that prevents your team from publishing generic, AI-generated content.<\/p>\n<p>Again, focus on quality and what makes your company unique. This will allow you to stand out in a sea of companies using AI to generate copy and visuals.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay on top of these AI marketing trends<\/h2>\n<p>While AI is likely to evolve in capabilities and use cases in the coming years, in ways we can\u2019t even imagine, there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s here for good. Continue to stay on top of the latest AI marketing trends to ensure you\u2019re ready for everything coming your way. Keep up with the headlines, see what your competitors are up to, and stay in the loop as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond this, don\u2019t neglect the importance of traditional marketing techniques, either. No matter the direction AI takes, foundational marketing knowledge and a focus on quality will always be paramount to success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Need more 2024 marketing trends?
