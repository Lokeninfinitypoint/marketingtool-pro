The higher that number, the more people will see your content if you rank.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition\">Keyword difficulty<\/a> is an estimate of how hard it\u2019ll be to get your content on the front page of search results. That\u2019s important because even if people search for a term 10,000 times a month, no one will see your content if it isn\u2019t ranking.<\/p>\n<p>If your site is new or has a low domain rating (you can find that on tools like Ahrefs or Moz), then aim for keywords with a lower keyword difficulty and at least some traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - Ahrefs.\" width=\"937\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94212 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs-480x266.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nike has a pretty good domain rating.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Produce for the platform<\/h3>\n<p>A long-form article is great for your blog, but it won\u2019t work on most social channels. And of course, text doesn\u2019t play on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\">TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Know what works on each channel you plan to publish on and create content specific to each.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make it mobile-friendly<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/blog\/what-percentage-of-internet-traffic-is-mobile?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Well over half<\/a> of all internet traffic comes from mobile devices. So the content you publish needs to be easily viewable on small screens.<\/p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, this means utilizing a responsive web design that optimizes itself according to the device.<\/p>\n<p>But for content creators, it means things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing shorter paragraphs so people don\u2019t see a screen full of text.<\/li>\n<li>Breaking up content with bullet points, images, and subheads so it\u2019s more skimmable.<\/li>\n<li>Including graphics that make information easier to understand without a lot of copy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - Orthocarolina blog post.\" width=\"325\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94213 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp 325w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho-163x300.webp 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Short paragraphs, images, and internal links help break up walls of text on small screens.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Research your content competitors<\/h3>\n<p>Content competitors are the websites and organizations that publish content on the same topics as you. They may also be business competitors, but not always.<\/p>\n<p>Researching your content competitors will yield a ton of valuable insights for your own content strategy. To start, read through their blogs and social feeds. Note what types of content they publish, how often, their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand voice<\/a>, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Then, review these guides to learn many more ways to learn from your competitors online:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">9 Sneaky Ways to Spy on Your Competitors\u2019 Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-library\">How to Use the Google Ads Library to Spy on Competitors<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">How to Do Competitor Keyword Analysis in 5 Steps (+Free Template!)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f<strong> Want more?<\/strong> Download How to Spy on Your Competitors:<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors\/\"> 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6. Look for topics in forums<\/h3>\n<p>Online forums like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">Reddit<\/a> are gold mines of audience research. Find the subreddits your target audience hangs out in. Review them regularly to see what challenges perplex them, what questions they ask, and what insider terms they use.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - AMA on Reddit.\" width=\"937\" height=\"490\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94214 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA-480x251.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Winnipeg\/comments\/1dz4u6w\/ama_im_the_ceo_of_peg_city_car_coop_ask_me\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Ask-me-anything<\/em><\/a><em> (AMA) events are a great way to drum up questions and content ideas on Reddit.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. Use lead magnets<\/h3>\n<p>Ideally, you want to turn content viewers into leads. One proven way to do that is by using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnets<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A lead magnet is a free piece of valuable content or offer (like an ebook or template) that a business gives away in exchange for a person\u2019s contact information, usually an email address, to generate leads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - Quiz example.\" width=\"937\" height=\"509\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94215 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz-480x261.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Try adding lead magnets to a pop-up that triggers when someone scrolls partway down a blog post. Tie the offer into the topic if possible (like offering a yard maintenance calendar on a blog post about growing grass).<\/p>\n<h3>8. Repurpose content for more reach<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">Creating content<\/a> takes time. You can multiply the return on a piece of content by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-repurposing\"> repurposing it<\/a> for use on several channels.<\/p>\n<p>There are few limitations to how you do this. A single interview with an industry expert can become clips you share on social media, a long-form blog post, quotes for your next annual report, and fodder for getting featured in industry publications.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Mention your products thoughtfully<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing will lose trust faster than being overtly salesy when someone expects an unbiased answer to their question. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ever mention what you sell. You just have to be strategic in how you do it.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to include your product in a roundup of the best options in your category. It\u2019s also fine to share a screenshot of what you sell if it fits in the narrative of your post. Just don\u2019t promise a list of tips and make them all about your product.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Make the most of your content evergreen<\/h3>\n<p>In content marketing, evergreen content is material that remains valuable and relevant over time. It continues to attract traffic, engagement, and leads long after it\u2019s published.<\/p>\n<p>An example of an evergreen content post would be a guide to fixing a leaky faucet or creating a personal budgeting spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - blog post about budgeting.\" width=\"937\" height=\"588\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94217 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-budget-480x301.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vermontfederal.org\/blog\/7-steps-for-creating-a-healthy-personal-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>By contrast, time-sensitive content would be a news article about a one-time event in your industry or a list of timely trends.<\/p>\n<p>Both are useful in a content strategy, but evergreen content delivers the best return over its lifetime.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Use AI wisely<\/h3>\n<p>AI has advanced at a rapid rate, and it\u2019s now capable of spinning up entire blog posts and even videos in a matter of seconds. That challenge with letting it do so is that it can also do it for every one of your competitors just as easily. Which means your AI content will look an awful lot like theirs.<\/p>\n<p>To get the efficiency benefits of AI without churning out copycat content, think of it like an assistant and a creative sparring partner instead of a writer or videographer.<\/p>\n<p>Here are several ways you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\">use AI<\/a> to create better content faster:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summarize:<\/strong> Ask AI to provide key insights from a long video transcript or call recording.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Suggest:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\">Prompt your AI<\/a> to suggest alternative titles, captions, or a starter outline you can riff off of.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Scrutinize: <\/strong>Feed a piece of content to your AI tool and have it review for missing subtopics, logic gaps, or spelling errors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Survey:<\/strong> Give AI a large dataset and ask it to identify common themes or insights that can be turned into blog post topics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>12. Start optimizing for AI search engines<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"12\"><\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-search-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI is taking over search<\/a> in a big way. People are using platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/21\/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing\">ChatGPT<\/a>, Perplexity, and Gemini to find answers. And Google\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews-statistics\">AI Overviews<\/a> are showing up on more results pages.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, that means less traffic being referred to your website from traditional search engine results. On the other hand, there\u2019s a growing opportunity to generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">referral traffic directly from these AI platforms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Much of what you do for SEO will help you get cited by AI. So go all in optimizing for Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T signals<\/a>, target conversational queries, and try to earn more brand mentions on other websites.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, look at how each platform responds to your target keywords. Check how they autofill suggestions and take note of what related questions they suggest.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing - Perplexity reply.\" width=\"937\" height=\"422\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94218 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/content-marketing-wordstream-related-480x216.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Perplexity\u2019s related questions<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>13. Update old content<\/h3>\n<p>Over time, some of the assets you create will fall out of date, lose search rankings, and stop pulling in new visitors. They aren\u2019t dead; they\u2019re actually a shortcut to boosting traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Run a search on GA4 or your favorite SEO tool to find content that\u2019s no longer performing. If it\u2019s an evergreen post, look for ways to bring it back to life. Update links, include new data, and ID any informational gaps it\u2019s not currently addressing.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Use lots of original quotes and data<\/h3>\n<p>Original insights and data are a magic pill of success in content marketing.

Try these options instead:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interview internal and external experts for original insights and quotes.<\/li>\n<li>Post a quick poll on social media.<\/li>\n<li>Anonymize data about your customer base and share it.<\/li>\n<li>Run experiments that test ideas from industry experts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"best-tools-for-content-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h2>Best tools for content marketing<\/h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/06\/content-marketing-tools\">many tools<\/a> to help you come up with new ideas, create content, distribute it, and track your progress.

We&#8217;ve got answers!<\/p>\n<h3>Is it really worth doing content marketing in 2025?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, content marketing is still one of the most effective ways to grow a business in 2025. Trust is only becoming more important in the buying decision, and content helps you build it. Plus, content marketing is a great way to get found on more AI search results, so it\u2019ll remain relevant in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the key content marketing characteristics?<\/h3>\n<p>The four characteristics of content marketing are audience-focused, value-first, long-term, and relationship-driven. Together, these traits explain why it remains so effective in 2025. Content that solves real problems, builds trust over time, and strengthens customer relationships will consistently deliver valuable returns.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the three C\u2019s of content marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>The three C\u2019s of content marketing are creation, curation, and conversation. You create original content that showcases your expertise, curate relevant resources that add extra value for your audience, and spark conversations that build trust and lasting relationships.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the main goal of content marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>The main goal of content marketing is to attract, engage, and convert an audience by providing valuable, relevant information that builds trust and drives profitable customer action over time.<\/p>\n<h3>How is content marketing different from traditional advertising?<\/h3>\n<p>Content marketing differs from traditional advertising because it focuses on delivering helpful, relevant information that audiences seek out, while traditional advertising usually interrupts people with promotional messages. Instead of pushing products directly, content marketing builds long-term trust and relationships, making it less about quick sales and more about sustained customer loyalty.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I start content marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>You can start content marketing by first defining your target audience and goals, then building a strategy around the types of content that will serve them best (such as blogs, videos, emails, etc.). From there, research keywords, create a content calendar, and publish consistently, while promoting your work through the right channels and measuring results to refine your approach.<\/p>\n<h2>Grow with content marketing<\/h2>\n<p>There are dozens of types of content marketing and many ways to leverage each one. It\u2019s easy to get bogged down with the options.<\/p>\n<p>Our best advice is to start small by simply sharing your knowledge on the platforms with which you&#8217;re most comfortable. If you\u2019re a divorce lawyer who loves TikTok, post a few videos explaining the biggest challenges of navigating a legal separation.<\/p>\n<p>You can turn them into blog posts or Instagram Reels later.
