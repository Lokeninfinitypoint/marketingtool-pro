Monthly customer newsletters, daily blog RSS feeds, curated drip campaigns\u2026<\/p>\n<p>One thing you probably didn\u2019t think of is employee email signatures.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4ed201b5-5828-4c5e-a14f-cf3b0f322bf5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures1.png\" alt=\"Email signatures\" width=\"815\" height=\"445\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Image via <a href=\"https:\/\/emailsignaturerescue.com\/email-signatures\/industries\/corporate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Email Signature Rescue<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your employees engage with customers, vendors, friends, and family via email. With the right <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">call to action<\/a> in their email signature, any of those email recipients could turn into new website visitors, customers, or social media followers.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, optimizing your employee email signatures will never be as effective as your other email marketing efforts. You shouldn\u2019t expect to add these to your employee signatures and suddenly meet your sales goal for the year, but they will drive real incremental conversions for your business.<\/p>\n<p>And the best part? This is the rare kind of marketing tactic where you can truly set it and forget it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are seven ways you can get more out of your employee email signatures. Choose one, create a version for your company, and share it with your employees.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Drive Website Traffic<\/h2>\n<p>Promoting existing content in your email signature <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">drives more web traffic<\/a> and social shares. If you\u2019ve got the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/21\/landing-page-designs\">landing page<\/a> set up with an email newsletter signup form, it could drive more subscriptions, too.<\/p>\n<p>From <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">a high-converting case study<\/a> to an infographic that went viral on Twitter, choose content that actually delivers. Coordinate with your content team and review conversion data in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">Google Analytics<\/a> to discover what content performs especially well for your business. Then link to it in your signature.<\/p>\n<p>Pro tip: Don\u2019t just say \u201cRead our latest blog\/whitepaper\/ebook!\u201d Hyperlink intriguing anchor text that compels the reader to click, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesware.com\/blog\/email-signature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yesware<\/a> does in this example below:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3e74c33-0620-4976-ba20-a60d47023e4a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-cta-example-1.png\" alt=\"Email signatures call-to-action example\" width=\"504\" height=\"178\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Alternately, you might use a graphic to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/28\/content-advertising\">advertise the content<\/a>, as in this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/31054\/10-clever-ways-your-email-signature-can-support-your-marketing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dee26221-a3c3-47c3-ac26-555a534da624\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-cta-example-2.png\" alt=\"Email signatures free downloadable guide call to action\" width=\"450\" height=\"145\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>2. Increase Your Following<\/h2>\n<p>Want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/21\/instagram-marketing-tools\">grow your social media fanbase<\/a>? You\u2019ve got options.<\/p>\n<p>At a minimum, you should link to your main social media channels in your signature. People like to follow brands they work with and buy from. Link using small icons to your social media channels, rather than including long URLs. Icons are cleaner, instantly recognizable, and simply less exhausting to look at, as demonstrated in this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getmailbird.com\/10-examples-professional-email-signatures-businesses\/\">Mailbird<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"499acf97-4d0a-4fe5-82d1-b5f5654b239e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-cleaner-design.png\" alt=\"Email signatures cleaner design more info less space\" width=\"584\" height=\"247\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you desperately want follows, you could take a more aggressive route like Limehouse Creative did. There\u2019s a lot of information in their email signature below, but your eye is immediately drawn to the graphic, right? If social follows are most important to your marketing strategy, this is a great option. Otherwise, you might be better off using the banner to advertise a content piece or invite demo registrations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0aebf86-3331-4cb3-902a-781590696d09\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-social-media.png\" alt=\"Email signatures to drive Facebook likes social follows\" width=\"390\" height=\"291\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/small-bizsense.com\/10-examples-of-well-crafted-email-signatures-for-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmallBusinessSense<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>3. Generate Leads<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of demos, your email signature is a perfect opportunity for your salespeople to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/01\/lead-generation-ideas\">generate leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Just like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/16\/real-estate-marketing\">realtors<\/a>, salespeople know the power of faces, so good ones always include a headshot in their signature. The example also includes a \u201cRequest a demo\u201d link to make it easy for leads to connect with the sales rep. The only suggestion we have would be to highlight that anchor text in another color or bolded font.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f7553a04-6099-4e7f-b5ee-d362f7983e86\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-sales-rep-example.png\" alt=\"Email signatures sales rep example with call to action\" width=\"852\" height=\"200\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesware.com\/blog\/email-signature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yesware<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>4. Turn Leads into Customers<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got a thread going with a lead, the goal is to push them <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">further down the funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You might take a cue from our first tip, and link your salespeople\u2019s signatures to your top-performing case study. Or you could work with your CRM software to dynamically change your email signatures depending on a lead\u2019s status. For leads that suddenly went cold, or are simply lollygagging, adding a discount offer could be just the thing that wins them over. You can even reuse the banners from your display ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2235f848-847f-4eeb-b275-2a36252e92ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-special-offers.png\" alt=\"Email signatures special offers\" width=\"499\" height=\"331\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/professionals.wisestamp.com\/realtors\/resources\/your-secret-to-more-sales-is-your-email-signature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WiseStamp<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>5. Promote Upcoming Events<\/h2>\n<p>Does your company regularly attend trade shows? Drive traffic your way with a banner announcing your booth number that links to the event registration page. You can also hype upcoming product launch parties, local networking happy hours, webinars, and Facebook Live events. Just make sure you update your signature after the event has passed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0b74700-6416-4a89-b3b8-6540a2196366\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-promote-events.png\" alt=\"Email signatures promote events\" width=\"826\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Image via\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/examples-of-email-signatures-that-drive-conversions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>6.

Follow these best practices to set yourselves up for success.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make it Mandatory<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone likes to express their individuality, but your corporate email signature is not the place to do it. Tell employees to leave the artistry to their social media profiles.<\/p>\n<p>Having an unified look across all your employee signatures both elevates the professionalism of your brand and avoids the formatting issues, typos, and rogue color and font choices that can happen when you let employees take it into their own hands.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Provide a Template<\/h3>\n<p>Ideally, your IT team can code these across your employees\u2019 email settings. If that\u2019s not possible, supply employees with a plug-and-play template they can copy into the signature settings for your email provider. Clear, easy-to-follow instructions should accompany the template.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use UTM Tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Track your efforts by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/10-best-ways-use-utm-codes-conversion-tracking\/173841\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adding UTM codes<\/a>\u00a0to the links in your email signatures. You can check on your progress in Google Analytics under Acquisition &gt; Campaigns. This also allows you to test different CTAs or types of content over time, or even different placements within the signature (e.g. linking to content above or below your social icons).<\/p>\n<h3>4. Test the Design on Mobile<\/h3>\n<p>We live in a mobile-first world now. Make sure your email signature adheres to that worldview. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/guides\/email-marketing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nearly half of people<\/a> read their emails from a mobile device instead of their desktop computer, so test to make sure your design fits and looks good on different smartphones and tablet devices.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Follow Rules of Good Design<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t use too many colors or fonts, and make sure that what you do use complements each other. Consider using pipes or other dividers to break up text and make it readable.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have access to a designer, try out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/email-signature-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot&#8217;s email signature generator<\/a>. Fill out all your info, choose a design, and voila!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"72794ada-5d88-4a3d-bdc5-9879bddf3ffc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-signatures-hubspot-template-generator.png\" alt=\"Email signatures HubSpot email signature generator templates\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1204\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Signed, Sealed, Delivered<\/h2>\n<p>With exciting announcements like the most recent <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/07\/google-algorithm-update\">Google algorithm upgrade<\/a>, the latest Snapchat feature, or a new iPhone happening on a near-daily basis, it\u2019s easy for marketers to get shiny ball syndrome.
