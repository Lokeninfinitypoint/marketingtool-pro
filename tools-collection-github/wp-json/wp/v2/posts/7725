One of the most effective ways to win the hearts of new viewers on your channel is with a captivating trailer.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn how to make a great trailer for a powerful YouTube hook.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a YouTube channel trailer?<\/h2>\n<p>A YouTube channel trailer is a video designed to help viewers quickly learn about your channel. When enabled, the trailer is displayed at the top of your YouTube channel page and plays automatically for your non-subscribed visitors.<\/p>\n<p>The trailer is crucial because if you&#8217;re going to put in the effort to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promote your YouTube channel<\/a>, you&#8217;ll need a way to convert that traffic into subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you should include in your trailer in order to hook viewers in immediately:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A quick introduction of your business\u00a0and who your channel is\u00a0for\u00a0(bloggers, hikers, gamers, etc.).<\/li>\n<li>An overview of the type of video content you publish.<\/li>\n<li>A highlight reel of your video content.<\/li>\n<li>Your schedule for uploading videos.<\/li>\n<li>A compelling call to action (CTA) encouraging viewers to subscribe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s a super simple YouTube channel trailer template from Biteable:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-template-biteable-1.png\" alt=\"screenshot of youtube channel trailer template by biteable\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to create a YouTube channel trailer<\/h2>\n<p>So how can you create a YouTube channel trailer that covers all the bases above in an interesting way? Let&#8217;s dive in.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Step into your viewers&#8217;\u00a0shoes<\/h3>\n<p>To create an awesome YouTube channel trailer, you should assume that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about you or your brand and ask yourself the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does the viewer immediately want to know about my channel?<\/li>\n<li>What knowledge is most important to impart in the first few seconds?<\/li>\n<li>How do I want the viewer to <em><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">feel<\/a> <\/em>after watching my channel trailer?<\/li>\n<li>Why should they be compelled to return to my channel?<\/li>\n<li>What tone should I use\u2014playful, humorous, serious, informative?<\/li>\n<li>What color schemes and fonts are aligned with my brand?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Viewers\u00a0should be certain that they\u2019ve found the right channel for them in the first 5-10 seconds &#8211; just from the information you provide them within your video trailer.<\/p>\n<p>These questions are crucial to achieving your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/28\/facebook-video-marketing\">video marketing<\/a> goals, whether that&#8217;s to build a community or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/how-to-make-money-on-youtube\/\">make money on YouTube<\/a>.\u00a0When you understand what your audience wants\u2014and not what you <em>think<\/em>\u00a0they want\u2014you\u2019ll be able to serve up valuable content.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create a well-structured script<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to be speaking in your trailer, write a script or jot down some talking points for your video.<\/p>\n<p>Structure\u00a0your video from start to finish and put\u00a0a clear and compelling message in it. The more succinct and impactful your channel trailer, the more effectively it will work to get you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/14\/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube\">more views<\/a> and new subscribers on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>From the words and images appearing on the screen to the music and sounds that viewers hear, everything should clearly communicate your channel\u2019s message <em>and <\/em>match the way your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand looks and feels<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of an awesome (scripted) channel trailer:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bNk5lrcSwkk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Important Note: <\/strong>Using a script or outline for your trailer is important even if you&#8217;re not someone who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2.com\/categories\/social-media-mgmt#learn-more\">usually plans out their videos<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You have to cover a lot of material, and you only have a minute or so in which to do it. A script will help you avoid a lot of &#8220;<em>umms<\/em>&#8221; and make it possible for you to hit all your key points in the least amount of time possible.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use captions and clips<\/h3>\n<p>To make your trailer more appealing, combine short scenes, sounds, text (either music or voiceover, or both). Add a short title within the first screen or\u00a0list out key topics you&#8217;re covering in the video.<\/p>\n<p>Also, you may want to use captions for those watching the trailer with the sound off. Maybe they&#8217;re listening to music at the same time, or were put off when it started playing automatically.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a captioned YouTube channel trailer:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-what-you-will-share-1.png\" alt=\"youtube channel trailer screenshot with text overlay\" width=\"720\" height=\"398\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qT3huBQQabQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View channel trailer here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Include music and high-quality graphics<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing draws in your viewers more than animated graphics combined with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/18\/music-in-ads\">right music<\/a>. Great visuals will keep your viewers spellbound, and the music will set the tone and energy for your channel trailer.<\/p>\n<p>Just make sure that you only pick music and graphics that are consistent with your words, channel, and brand<strong>.<\/strong>\u00a0A cohesive brand image leads to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">increased brand awareness<\/a>, making your company and its product memorable and recognizable to viewers.<\/p>\n<p>There is plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-graphic-design-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">graphic design software<\/a> that makes it easy to keep your images consistent and high-quality.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Appealing to the senses in your video trailer can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">emotionally<\/a> move your viewers to subscribe.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While not a channel trailer, Asana shows a good example of unique illustrations:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-illustration-style-1.png\" alt=\"youtube channel trailer tips\u2014example of illustrative video\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jY0-gsNImlk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View video here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>According to expert video strategists, it&#8217;s important to keep the viewer\u2019s eyes moving so you can retain their attention on your video.<\/p>\n<p>This aspect is particularly important because, as you know, YouTube channel homepages often look quite &#8220;busy&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Everywhere you look there are buttons, playlists, <a href=\"https:\/\/instasize.com\/blog\/how-to-create-eye-catching-youtube-thumbnails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video thumbnails<\/a>, and even an option for visitors to leave your channel altogether!<\/p>\n<p>But, although fast-moving, dynamic footage has been shown to increase engagement, keep in mind that this type of content isn\u2019t ideal for <em>all <\/em>YouTube channels\u2014like a meditation channel, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>However, you <em>can <\/em>still use elements like text, visually appealing images, and short scenes to draw your viewer\u2019s immediate attention.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Keep it short<\/h3>\n<p>The entire point of a YouTube channel trailer is\u00a0to pitch great things about yourself, your brand, and your content\u00a0to new viewers in <strong>the quickest way possible<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So, unlike\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">explainer videos<\/a>\u00a0(which are great within your channel), the channel trailer itself should\u00a0instantly arrest the attention of your viewers and\u00a0in a few short seconds, convey all the information they need to decide whether or not yours is the right channel for them.<\/p>\n<p>After all, what are the odds that someone will sit through a five\u00a0or ten-minute video before deciding whether or not they are in the right place?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Although there isn&#8217;t a \u201cperfect\u201d length for a YouTube channel trailer, you should aim for about 30 to 90 seconds. <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This should be sufficient for you to tell new visitors who you are, what type of content to expect from your YouTube channel, and when you will be posting new uploads.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, when it comes to YouTube channel trailers, less is more.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Show highlights<\/h3>\n<p>As YouTube says, &#8220;Show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221;. In addition to sharing all the important information pertaining to your brand and channel, you can also show your audience a highlight reel that makes them want to view the videos in your channel.<\/p>\n<p>And make sure these are actual highlights from actual videos in your channel. This will save you from\u00a0<em>unsubscribes <\/em>down the line when it turns out that your videos weren&#8217;t at all what new subscribers expected.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried that you won&#8217;t have enough time to give your audience the information they need <em>as well as<\/em> show a highlight reel, don&#8217;t worry. You can do both at the same time. Will Smith\u2019s YouTube channel trailer is essentially one big highlight reel.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-will-smith-highlight-reel-1.png\" alt=\"youtube channel trailer tips\u2014example of trailer using highlight footage\" width=\"720\" height=\"430\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WFknCgyJOI4\">View video here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>As a small business, you\u2019re not going to have extreme highlights like this, but you can\u00a0use short scenes to<strong> show your audience the nature and tone of your videos.<\/strong> Are they funny, educational, serious, relaxing, entertaining, actionable?<\/p>\n<p>Highlights for your business might include are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bloopers and other funny clips<\/li>\n<li>Clips that show the interesting ways you\u2019ll provide information<\/li>\n<li>Clips of industry influencers you\u2019ll interview<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-highlight-clips-1.png\" alt=\"examples of highlight clips you can use for your youtube channel trailer\" width=\"720\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This will be easy to do if you have already published some videos on your channel.

Stockpile videos beforehand<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;re not going to have any highlights to show if you don&#8217;t already have videos ready. You don&#8217;t have to have them all published, but enough to support the claims in your trailer.<\/p>\n<p>In SearchLab&#8217;s YouTube channel homepage, you can gather right away from the video thumbnails that you&#8217;re going to learn local SEO and laugh.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-searchlab-greg-gifford-1.png\" alt=\"youtube channel homepage with thumbnails\" width=\"720\" height=\"365\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC3kf-yP3bwhI6YvFFeKfegA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SearchLab&#8217;s YouTube channel homepage<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Note also that video thumbnails are an excellent <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/10\/youtube-seo-tips\">YouTube SEO tactic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Take viewers on a journey<\/h3>\n<p>As humans, we tend to gravitate towards other people, and showcasing your unique personality in front of the camera enables you to deeper stronger connections with new audiences.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where storytelling comes in. The most successful channel trailers are those that take viewers on a journey.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Don&#8217;t simply\u00a0provide information to viewers; take them on a journey and\u00a0<em>show<\/em> your story. <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This means everything from the reason you started your channel to the topics your cover, and everything in between. Stories can be mesmerizing!<\/p>\n<p>Storytelling also comes with the following benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It<strong> hits the emotional quotient<\/strong>;<\/li>\n<li>It makes it easier for you to <strong>convey your personality<\/strong>;<\/li>\n<li>It k<strong>eeps your viewers engaged<\/strong> and eager for more;<\/li>\n<li>And, it also <strong>makes your content more memorable<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you tell personal stories in a fun, fresh, and relatable way, people feel like they know you, which ultimately leads to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/12\/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube\">more subscribers to your channel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a YouTube channel trailer that takes viewers on an exciting journey:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-channel-trailer-storytelling-foodtube-1.png\" alt=\"example of youtube channel trailer using storytelling\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Wqko7xVKW2s\">View trailer here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8.
