I even remember when it happened, in March 2014. I had just signed a job offer for after graduation and Spotify released premium pricing for students. It was beautifully serendipitous and we\u2019ve been in a committed, monthly-fee relationship everx since. In fact, now I pay for a family plan and have gotten all my family members (and maybe some roommates) hooked on it.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20ians20pizza.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students ian's pizza\" width=\"800\" height=\"593\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Moral of the story: if you market to college students early, they can become your most loyal customers.

The shiny-fruit company consistently gives discounts to college students, creating lifelong Mac users.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not completely convinced that college students are a valuable market, here are some stats before we dive in\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Why market to college students?<\/h2>\n<p>College students are a huge demographic in the US, consisting mostly of 18 to 24-year-olds. These young adults have spending power: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/articles\/marketing-to-college-students\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>15M group spends more than $200B annually<\/u><\/a>. Not only are they age-stable, but they also are geographically stagnant for 4-5 years. That means you have a lot of time to develop branding and marketing specific to this group to see what will really stick.<\/p>\n<p>While this is most likely already living in the back of your mind, Gen Z is the tech-native generation. They are constantly online (especially during quarantine), consuming content, shopping, and engaging with peers. And they\u2019re cleverer than previous generations when it comes to advertising: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/01\/11\/generation-z-avoids-advertising-uses-ad-blockers-and-skips-content.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>almost 70% of Gen Zers use ad blockers<\/u><\/a>.

Leverage trials and samples<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s just address the elephant in the room outright: college kids love free stuff. I can\u2019t tell you the number of events I attended in college because they offered free food. What better way to hook some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/18\/loyalty-marketing\">long-term loyal customers<\/a> than offering your product for free?<\/p>\n<p>There are a few ways you can actually get your free samples or trials <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\">in front of your audience<\/a>; try coordinating with residence life to have a move-in kit available for the fall semester or sponsored study break during midterms or finals. If you\u2019re a food service on Seamless, GrubHub, or DoorDash, you can offer a discount for first-time diners; once they get a taste, they\u2019ll keep coming back for more.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20grubhub.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students grubhub\" width=\"800\" height=\"417\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>2. Offer targeted discounts<\/h2>\n<p>Just like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/23\/personalized-video-marketing\">personalized<\/a> ads, discounts specific to your audience are a great way to engage them. Everyone wants to think that their school is the best\u2014what better way to reinforce that than advertising \u201cFor a limited time, Villanova students get free fries with every cheeseburger.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you want an easier, more direct way to get feet in the door (or online orders), offer discounts if a student provides their student ID at the time of purchase. You can often get those types of deals listed in a coupon catalog handed out in Student Unions or in Move-In Day packets. Free advertising for all!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20mac.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students mac\" width=\"800\" height=\"554\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>3. Write clever copy<\/h2>\n<p>Have you hung out with college kids recently? If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019re missing out. I truly learn new words every time I\u2019m around the youths. Since college came into existence, kids have been creating their own lingo for academia and partying (and I\u2019m really trying to make \u201cgroovy\u201d come back into style).<\/p>\n<p>While I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying *too* hard to speak their language, catching students\u2019 eyes with clever marketing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/12\/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy\">ad copy <\/a>is a must. Whatever you do, don\u2019t be lame. Not sure where to start? Here are some tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">writing creative copy<\/a> that may help.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Mind your social accounts<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/30\/social-media-advertising-tips\">social ads<\/a> before, you probably already know that it is a great way to reach Millennials and Zillennials. When it comes to marketing to college students, make sure you\u2019re leveraging those platforms; even if you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/01\/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses\">don\u2019t have the budget<\/a> to spend on ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>There are easy ways to engage college students on social media.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content<\/a>; encourage your customers to tag your products in their posts so you can easily re-post.<\/li>\n<li>Spend time liking and commenting on related posts; this will help the algorithms show your account to more potential customers.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">Announce new products<\/a> or releases on your social accounts; if you\u2019re a big, national brand, think about making an account specifically for the college crowd you\u2019re serving, e.g. \u201cVillanovaDominos\u201d or \u201cMaybellinePHL.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>5. Try out traditional tactics<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry about going old school when it comes to advertising. College kids are still pinning coupons to their fridge or digging them out when it\u2019s time to order food. Think about sponsoring on-campus events, or having an on-campus pop-up shop in the middle of the main through-way to get the most out of student foot traffic.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20coupons.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students coupons\" width=\"800\" height=\"389\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I can\u2019t tell you the number of coupons just like this that were stacked in my kitchen drawer in my college apartment. They came in handy when we didn\u2019t want to go grocery shopping or cook, but still needed to stick to a college kid budget!<\/p>\n<h2>6. Host a giveaway, raffle, or competition<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">build up your social following<\/a> or your email listserv, or simply get a lot of students engaged with your business, host a giveaway. You\u2019ll need to make it tempting enough for college students to actually give away their information and\/or money to win. That could be a Sonos speaker system to boost the music at parties, covering the cost of a parking pass on campus, offering a lifetime of free sides (french fries forever!), naming a product after them, the list goes on and on.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students205k.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students 5k\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can also pay into the competitive nature of college kids! Just like emphasizing exclusive discounts for colleges, if you have more than one university in your area, make a little friendly competition like this 5K did.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Engage student ambassadors<\/h2>\n<p>Pay attention to the students who are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal patrons of your business<\/a>. Whether that means engaging with them in your store or restaurant or keeping track of recurring orders online, make sure you\u2019re acknowledging their loyalty. Think of your student ambassadors as nano-influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Make some ambassador kits, including simple pieces of swag like a t-shirt, bottle opener, water bottle, etc. and arm them with materials to give away to their peers. This can work best if they get referral discounts themselves!<\/p>\n<p>While not college-student-specific, Aerie is great at leveraging user generated content on their social accounts. They are regularly #regram-ing content from their customers\u2014which just makes it easier to fill your social calendar!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20user20generated.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students ambassadors\" width=\"800\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>8. Consider social causes<\/h2>\n<p>I was in college during KONY 2012. What a movement. And let me tell you, everyone was talking about it. I mean professors, students, residential\u00a0life, school administrators, food service employees, and more. It was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/facebook-ads-boycott\">social justice<\/a> cause of the year.<\/p>\n<p>By nature, college students are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to save the world. And this generation in particular is invested in social justice. Reflect on an issue that affects the community your business is in. Not only will it make the world a better place to have another contribution to the plastic-free or BLM fight, but students will also be more inclined to give your brand a second look if their money is also going to a cause they believe in.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Look for college media sources<\/h2>\n<p>Meet college students where they are and with what they\u2019re consuming. Most likely, the students you\u2019re targeting have a student-lead newspaper, weekly newsletters, or even a popular online student forum or app. Reach out to those publications to sponsor a post or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">display ad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>SImilar to reaching out to student ambassadors, look for student-run social media accounts to offer sponsored posts. Most schools will have an instagram account for their mascots or an \u201coverheard at *school name*\u201d. ICYMI, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/22\/tiktok-ads\"><u>TikTok is taking over the world<\/u><\/a>; reach out to student organizations (believe me, the dance team definitely has a TikTok account)\u00a0and ask to be featured in a video.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20market20to20college20students20tiktok.png\" alt=\"how to market to college students media sources\" width=\"800\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>10. Influence their parents<\/h2>\n<p>In the instance that your price point is a little too steep for the average college kid, target their parents. The best time to do this? Move-in day and parents weekend. Yes, this gets a bit complicated during, say, a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/02\/marketing-during-covid-19\">pandemic scenario<\/a>. But it\u2019s not impossible! Do not underestimate the tenacity of college kids to bribe a buck out of their loving parents.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for ways to get to parents, think about care packages! Emphasize how your product will help their child slay their midterms, finals, job interviews, presentations, you name it. Or maybe it will help them stay healthy, or make their tiny college dorm feel like home (my mother bought me *many* <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bedbathandbeyond.com\/store\/product\/verilux-reg-happylight-lucent-trade-light-therapy-lamp\/5324719\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>happy lights<\/u><\/a> to make it through the winter).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve seen success marketing to college students, we want to see it!
