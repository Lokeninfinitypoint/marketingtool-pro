Put together a content strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Hoping a blog post will have people flocking to your site? That might\u2019ve worked years ago when the web wasn\u2019t saturated with content that\u2019s been done dozens of times over. But in 2025, posting and praying for traction is a waste of time.<\/p>\n<p>You need a plan that keeps your content strategic and different from everything else out there. Here are some ways you can do that.<\/p>\n<h4>Set goals that matter<\/h4>\n<p>Before you write, ask yourself: What\u2019s the point of this content? Are you trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/keyword-mapping\">rank for a valuable keyword<\/a> or educate potential customers?<\/p>\n<p>An auto body shop, for instance, might aim to attract local customers by ranking for \u201cbest collision repair near me,\u201d while an auto parts retailer might focus on detailed product guides that help people choose the right brake pads. Your goals should define your strategy.<\/p>\n<h4>Know your audience<\/h4>\n<p>Who\u2019s reading your content? And what gets the most engagement? Study <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-pain-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer pain points<\/a> and look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-trends-2025\">search trends<\/a>. See what your competitors\u2019 content might be missing, and address that in your own content.<\/p>\n<p>Use these questions to identify your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-audience\/\">target audience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s buying from you or working with you now?<\/li>\n<li>What are their shopping habits?<\/li>\n<li>What are they buying?<\/li>\n<li>What info are they using to make a buying decision?<\/li>\n<li>Where are they located?<\/li>\n<li>Where are they hanging out online?<\/li>\n<li>Where are they finding you?<\/li>\n<li>When do they interact with your business?<\/li>\n<li>When are they looking for you and your business?<\/li>\n<li>Why are they buying from you?<\/li>\n<li>Why are they buying from your competitors?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Need more help finding the right audience to target?<\/strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Address current industry issues and trends<\/h4>\n<p>There aren\u2019t many industries that are stuck in time. Keeping with the automotive theme, EVs are becoming more popular, and self-driving tech is evolving.<\/p>\n<p>Your content should reflect the trends. If you&#8217;re running a mechanic shop, you could write about how new EVs impact traditional maintenance. Stay ahead of the conversation, and you won\u2019t have to chase engagement.<\/p>\n<h4>Get your timing right<\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-plan\">content calendar<\/a> lays the foundation for your publishing schedule. No need to scramble for ideas, and you\u2019ve got topics lined up ahead of time. Examples for the mechanic shop:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seasonal content: Push winter tire guides in fall, not January.<\/li>\n<li>Local events: If your town has a big car show, create content around prepping a vehicle for display.<\/li>\n<li>Industry happenings: Cover major automotive recalls or tech breakthroughs as they happen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s what a content calendar can look like, <a href=\"https:\/\/kantree.io\/blog\/tips\/using-kantree-as-a-content-planning-solution-with-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">courtesy of Kantree<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-png.avif\" alt=\"example of content calendar\" width=\"1040\" height=\"625\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90760\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-png.avif 1040w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-300x180.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-1024x615.avif 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-768x462.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-980x589.avif 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/content-calendar-example-480x288.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"focus-on-quality-over-quantity\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Focus on quality over quantity<\/h3>\n<p>People don\u2019t care how much you post\u2013they only care about how good it is. So, if you\u2019re running a travel agency, don\u2019t pump out generic \u201cTop 10 Beaches in the Caribbean\u201d articles that a thousand other sites have already covered. Instead, create something that people can\u2019t find anywhere else.<\/p>\n<h4>Prioritize researched, in-depth content<\/h4>\n<p>Readers want insider knowledge, real experiences, and even some secrets.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that travel agency specializes in Jamaica. Instead of writing a listicle about the best things to do in Jamaica, they could cover topics like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hidden Waterfalls in Jamaica That Only Locals Know About<\/li>\n<li>How to Plan a Stress-Free Trip to Jamaica with Kids<\/li>\n<li>The Best Time to Visit Jamaica Based on What You Want to Experience<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Aim for evergreen content that will be relevant over time<\/h4>\n<p>A well-written post should be like a great Jamaican rum, getting better over time. Or is that only for wine?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/16\/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing\">Evergreen content<\/a> stays relevant long after you hit publish. A guide to all-inclusive resorts in Montego Bay can be timeless, although it may need some updates in the long run. A post about an upcoming festival, on the other hand, is probably only going to be useful leading up to the event.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on creating something that will still provide value next year and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"meet-the-users-intent\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Meet the user\u2019s intent<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re creating content without thinking about <em>why<\/em> someone is searching for the topic, you\u2019ll probably miss the mark.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif\" alt=\"different types of keyword intents\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90734\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/keyword-search-intent-1-300x192.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/keyword-search-intent-1-768x492.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/keyword-search-intent-1-480x308.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Take a real estate business in Tampa, FL, for example. If they want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-differentiate-content\">stand out<\/a>, they can\u2019t just write about homes for sale in Tampa and call it a day. You need to understand exactly what people are looking for and give it to them. And you have to do it better than anyone else if you want to stand out.<\/p>\n<h4>Research some keywords first<\/h4>\n<p>Figure out what your potential readers (and customers) are actually searching for. Tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> can help you identify those keywords.<\/p>\n<p>But intent matters too. Maybe even more than search volume.<\/p>\n<p>Take these keywords:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best neighborhoods in Tampa (850 searches\/month)<\/li>\n<li>Tampa homes with boat docks (10 searches\/month)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Which one\u2019s better? Sure, the first one gets more volume. But if you\u2019re targeting people who are ready to buy a waterfront home, that second one is what you want for leads.<\/p>\n<h4>Look at the search engine results<\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got a keyword in mind, Google it yourself and look at the results. What\u2019s ranking at the top? Blog posts? Video tours? Market reports?<\/p>\n<p>If listicles rank well, your deep-dive essay might not be the right format. If short, transactional pages are ranking, a 3,000-word guide probably won\u2019t cut it. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/04\/content-marketing-goal-alignment\">type of content<\/a> you create should match what users (and Google) expect.<\/p>\n<h4>Address the user\u2019s needs directly<\/h4>\n<p>Imagine a couple relocating from New York, searching for the best areas in Tampa for families. They probably don\u2019t want a basic list. They want information about schools, public transit, etc. Instead of covering the same neighborhoods everyone else has already talked about, go deeper:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which areas have the best schools?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s the average home price in each neighborhood?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s the vibe: quiet suburban or walkable city streets?<\/li>\n<li>What do actual residents say?<\/li>\n<li>What are the commute times to downtown?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"zig-when-everyone-else-zags\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Zig when everyone else zags<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a ton of cookie-cutter content out there. Not to mention a surge of AI-generated fluff.<\/p>\n<p>Search \u201cbest things to do in Jamaica,\u201d and you\u2019ll see the same recycled list\u2013Dunn\u2019s River Falls, Seven Mile Beach, etc. These are great spots, no doubt (I\u2019ve visited). But if everyone is writing about the same stuff, why would someone choose to read your content over the others?<\/p>\n<p>If you want to stand out, offer something different. Challenge the status quo and people will pay attention.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of writing another \u201cTop 10 Attractions in Jamaica\u201d article, try \u201c5 Hidden Gems in Jamaica You Won\u2019t Find on Tourist Maps.\u201d Highlight real insider locations, like a peacock farm or a squeezed juice shack with no website.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif\" alt=\"example of unique content idea for visiting jamaica\" width=\"1200\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90761\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-300x74.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1024x253.avif 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-768x190.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1080x267.avif 1080w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-980x243.avif 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-480x119.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bring a fresh angle or a perspective that only <em>you<\/em> can provide.

Make your content scannable and visually appealing<\/h3>\n<p>People like to skim and scan. They\u2019re looking for quick answers, takeaways, and visuals to illustrate concepts. If your content is a wall of words, it\u2019s overwhelming and not very inviting.<\/p>\n<p>To keep readers engaged, structure your content so they can find what they need fast. Here are a few tips to do that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use headings and subheadings:<\/strong> These guide the reader and make the content easy to skim. Not everyone will read your page from beginning to end.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use bullet points and numbered lists: <\/strong>These highlight bite-size bits of information and keep attention from drifting. They make step-by-step instructions clear.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep paragraphs short: <\/strong>If your paragraphs are longer than 3-4 lines, consider breaking them up. Nobody wants to sift through walls of text to find something.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Us humans, we\u2019re visual creatures. We process images <a href=\"https:\/\/medtechintelligence.com\/column\/the-power-of-visuals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60,000<\/a> times faster than text. So, if you\u2019re only using words, you\u2019re missing an opportunity to stand out.<\/p>\n<p>For example, this is an ad but still illustrates the point. The visual is easier to process than a bunch of text explaining how to wear a face mask properly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif\" alt=\"example of visually appealing yet informative ad\" width=\"664\" height=\"376\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90762\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/visually-appealing-ad-example-300x170.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/visually-appealing-ad-example-480x272.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Try these to make your content more appealing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Images: <\/strong>A well-placed photo or diagram can reinforce your point or provide more context to the topic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Infographics:<\/strong> If you\u2019ve got a bunch of data points to share, show them in a graphic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Videos:<\/strong> If a video can explain it better than text, use one. Plus, some people prefer video over other formats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"include-data-and-expert-insights\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Include data and expert insights<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone can just make a claim. But backing it up with cited facts and expert opinions will turn your content into a resource that people trust.<\/p>\n<p>Data gives your claims real weight. Instead of vague statements, say something concrete like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif\" alt=\"good vs boring claim in stand out content writing\" width=\"936\" height=\"229\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90741\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-claim-300x73.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-claim-768x188.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-claim-480x117.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The more specific you can get, the better. If you\u2019re writing about the best Tampa neighborhoods for first-time buyers, show stats about affordability.<\/p>\n<p>Know what makes your content even more credible? Expert opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Give readers insights they can\u2019t get from run-of-the-mill articles. If you\u2019re a real estate agent, ask a mortgage broker to help you out with some firsthand knowledge to make your content unique.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif\" alt=\"good vs boring statement in content writing\" width=\"936\" height=\"367\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90742\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-statement-300x118.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-statement-768x301.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/good-vs-boring-statement-480x188.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"tell-a-story\"><\/div>\n<h3>8.

Try different content formats<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re only publishing blog posts, you\u2019re leaving potential traffic and conversions on the table. People consume content in different ways\u2013some love reading an in-depth article, while others prefer a quick video.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to stand out, experiment with different formats and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">repurpose your content across multiple platforms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some topics work best in written form, while others need a visual touch. Mix up your content game with blog posts, videos, infographics, downloadable assets, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t just create once and move on, though. Smart marketers repurpose their content across different channels. You could\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn a blog post into a video script and post it on YouTube.<\/li>\n<li>Break down key points into LinkedIn posts.<\/li>\n<li>Convert original research into an infographic.<\/li>\n<li>Take highlights from an expert interview and create a podcast clip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not all content formats perform equally, though.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bloggers who produce strong results<\/a>, the most effective formats are roundups, infographics, and original research.
