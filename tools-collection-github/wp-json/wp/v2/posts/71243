Your FAQ page can include various questions, from nuts-and-bolts asks (like your store hours) to objections you often hear from prospects.<\/p>\n<p>In this example from Italian specialty grocer and restaurant Eataly, the page about online shopping answers many logistical questions folks might have about placing an order. The page covers straightforward questions about the ordering process, from how to cancel an order to where to track shipments.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-eataly-example.jpg\" alt=\"how to write a faq page - example faq page\" width=\"664\" height=\"451\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71257 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-eataly-example.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-eataly-example-480x326.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eataly.com\/us_en\/support\/faqs\/online-store-faqs\/shopping-at-eataly-com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For an example of frequently asked questions focused on customer objections, let\u2019s look at the cosmetic brand Fresh.

Creates a positive customer experience<\/h3>\n<p>A well-crafted FAQ page anticipates any needs or questions a prospect might have. It shows them that you\u2019re thinking about their journey and are clued into what they expect from a brand. It\u2019s one more way to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-communications\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve customer communications<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Frees up your sales team while moving prospects down the sales funnel<\/h3>\n<p>It also reduces the burden on your sales or customer service teams. When prospects can easily find your return policy on your FAQ page, they don\u2019t need to call your team to ask about it before making a purchase. This frees up your team to focus on the more obscure or in-depth questions\u2013ones that need greater attention and care.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Boosts SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Outside of the benefits to customers and your employees, an FAQ page also provides your brand with <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO benefits<\/a>. When written correctly, an FAQ page helps you rank for terms relevant to your business. The question-and-answer nature of the pages makes the content a great source of <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/google-ctr-in-2018-paid-organic-no-click-searches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">potential Google-featured snippet results<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-benefits.jpg\" alt=\"benefits of creating faq page on your website\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-benefits.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-benefits-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"howto\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>How to create an FAQ page<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Are you ready to build your own FAQ page? Follow these steps.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Start with a brainstorming session<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Ask your team to create a list of questions about your business and offerings. Get your salespeople or customer service team involved! These folks are on the front lines with customers every day, making them an incredible resource. What questions do they hear over and over from prospects and customers?<\/p>\n<p>You may also consider <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-customer-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surveying existing customers<\/a>. Ask what led them to choose your brand over competitors. Their feedback may help you generate questions to include on your FAQ page.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you run a restaurant and decide to survey some of your regulars. They share that they love the relationship you have with local farms. Armed with this knowledge, you can create a section of your FAQ page detailing your ingredient sources.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, check out the competition. Do other brands in your space already have FAQ pages? If so, use their questions as inspiration when you\u2019re coming up with a list of your own.<\/p>\n<p>You can also incorporate some <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local keyword research<\/a> here by identifying long-tail keyword phrases that potential customers are already searching for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-questions-search.jpg\" alt=\"faq page - people also ask screenshot\" width=\"996\" height=\"408\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71266 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-questions-search.jpg 996w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-questions-search-980x401.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-questions-search-480x197.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 996px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can use the People also ask snippet on Google to see what questions people are asking related to your business or industry.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\"><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f Free guide <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\">Download now &gt;&gt; <\/span><a data-sheets-formula-bar-text-link=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\" data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#1155cc;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline;font-family:''Arial'';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\">The Big, Easy Guide to Keyword Research<\/a><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\"><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Edit your questions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have a lengthy list of potential questions for your FAQ page, it\u2019s time to pare things down. Cross off more obscure questions. Think of ways to combine similar questions into one entry.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the first letter in FAQ stands for \u201cfrequently.\u201d You don\u2019t need to answer every conceivable question on your FAQ page. Keep it focused on the questions your team hears every week.<\/p>\n<p>The length and complexity of your list of questions should mirror the complexity of what you sell. A bakery doesn\u2019t need a 75-question FAQ page, but a consulting firm that services various industries might.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/find-questions-for-faq-page.jpg\" alt=\"faq page example - services faq page example\" width=\"664\" height=\"404\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71258 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/find-questions-for-faq-page.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/find-questions-for-faq-page-480x292.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This cloud accounting service distilled the top questions into a relatively short&#8211;yet still comprehensive&#8211;list.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Structure your question list<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to map out how your list will look on the page. When you think about organizing your list, keep your audience\u2019s needs top of mind.<\/p>\n<p>Start with those questions that are genuinely asked most frequently. The questions at the top of the page should appeal to the broadest swath of your audience. For a retailer, questions about business hours or shipping information, for example, will be relevant to any consumer.<\/p>\n<p>If your list is long, consider grouping it into categories for ease of scanning. A healthcare facility might create sections like \u201cscheduling and canceling appointments\u201d or \u201cinsurance and billing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-to-faq-page-group-questions.jpg\" alt=\"how to create a faq page - group questions faq page example\" width=\"664\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71259 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-to-faq-page-group-questions.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-to-faq-page-group-questions-480x268.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.onequince.com\/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This<\/a> online retailer grouped FAQs into sections you can jump to.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Design the FAQ page with SEO in mind<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know how you\u2019d like your page to be structured, it\u2019s time to design the page and incorporate the content with an eye toward SEO.<\/p>\n<p>This starts with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword research<\/a>. In recent years, Google and other search engines have moved toward semantic search. Essentially, their systems are more sophisticated today and can now understand phrases and sentences, rather than just individual words.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/what-is-semantic-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semantic search<\/a> is why you see the responses you want when you type something like, \u201cHow late is Whole Foods open?\u201d into Google.<\/p>\n<p>FAQ pages can use semantic search to their advantage. By incorporating keywords into your questions, your business is more likely to rank in relevant queries.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to the example from fresh above, you\u2019ll notice that each of the questions under their product information header includes their brand name in the question. It doesn\u2019t read, \u201cWhat is your position on animal testing?\u201d Instead, it says, \u201cWhat is fresh\u2019s position on animal testing?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-example-fresh.jpg\" alt=\"faq page example - questions for an faq page\" width=\"664\" height=\"327\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71265 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-example-fresh.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-example-fresh-480x236.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That is likely an intentional SEO-minded move. Including the brand name in the question means fresh\u2019s FAQ page is more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank as the first result on Google<\/a> when a consumer types \u201cdoes fresh use animal testing\u201d into the search engine.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Don\u2019t forget about the user experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You must consider SEO in designing your FAQ page, but you never want to forget your all-important human audience. Consider incorporating the following elements into your FAQ page to make it easier for consumers to navigate the page.<\/p>\n<p>Many FAQ pages allow visitors to click on a question and retract it once they\u2019re done reading the answer. Design elements like this help your audience quickly scan the complete list of questions on your page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-examples-user-experience.jpg\" alt=\"faq page example - strong faq page user experience example \" width=\"664\" height=\"401\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71260 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-examples-user-experience.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/faq-page-examples-user-experience-480x290.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.olivegarden.com\/faqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Also, include your FAQ link in the footer of your website.
