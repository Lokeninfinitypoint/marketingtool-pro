We have some advice and we\u2019re eager to share.<\/p>\n<h2>Best Email Send Time: General Advice<\/h2>\n<p>These general email send time tips are widely accepted by the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/targeted-email-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing<\/a> community. They are great when you\u2019re starting off, but <strong>be sure to<\/strong> <strong>read on and see why they won\u2019t always work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Daytime vs. Nighttime. <\/strong>While this one may be obvious, it\u2019s usually better to send out your email campaigns during the daytime. You know, when people are awake. Not asleep.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mad Mondays. <\/strong>The general consensus is that you should avoid sending out email blasts on Mondays. Why? People are already bummed out about the end of the weekend. They march into the office and are flooded with emails they\u2019ve collected over the past few days. What\u2019s the first thing they do? Delete those emails of course!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weekends. <\/strong>Historically, weekends are the days when folks are out running errands and going on adventures. Weekends tend to have low open rates, so most marketers avoid them like the plague.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Give Heads Up for An Event.<\/strong> While <a href=\"mailto:http:\/\/blog.getresponse.com\/optimizing-your-campaigns-best-days-to-send-emails.html\">23% of emails are opened within 60 minutes<\/a> after being sent, there are some lingerers who may not check out your email until a day or two later. To be safe, send out event-oriented emails 3-5 days prior to an event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fan Favorites: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. <\/strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday have traditionally been favorite days to send email campaigns, as email marketers seek to avoid the Monday angst and Friday\u2019s itchy-feet. <a href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/deliverability\/deliverability-research\/find-your-best-sending-time\">MailChimp confirms<\/a> that Tuesday and Thursday are the two most popular days to send <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/marketing-newsletters\">email newsletters<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-time-to-send-emails-1.jpg\" alt=\"best time to send emails\" width=\"943\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mid-Week, Mid-day:<\/strong> The tried-and-true traditional approach of sending out email campaigns in the middle of the week and in the middle of the day tends to do pretty well. General know-how suggests sending emails between 1-3pm (9-11am is recommended as well). It\u2019s safe. It\u2019s reliable. It\u2019s not a bad choice. Just remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mailchimp.com\/insights-from-mailchimps-send-time-optimization-system\/\">MailChimp suggests 2 pm<\/a> as the optimal send time based on their data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/when-to-send-email-campaigns1-1.jpg\" alt=\"when to send email campaigns\" width=\"943\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>That\u2019s the Advice. Now Ignore it.<\/h2>\n<p>The tips above are considered general best practice advice for email marketing. However, there are many, many, situations which quickly challenge the classical suggestions above.<\/p>\n<p>Just take a look at our own WordStream data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best Time to Send Emails: Thursday 8 <strong>\u2013<\/strong> 9 am<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most email marketing articles would claim that 8 am is too early to send an email newsletter, but it works great for WordStream blasts \u2013 <strong>we get over 25% open rates with this time<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Worst Time to Send Emails<\/strong>: <strong>Tuesday &amp; Wednesday 8 \u2013 10 am<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many would claim that Tuesday and Wednesday mornings should be great times to send emails, but we\u2019ve found that Tuesday mornings result in under 5% open rates, while Wednesday mornings have below 5% click to open ratios.<\/p>\n<p>Our WordStream data shows that the status just ain\u2019t always quo.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why these old classic tips don\u2019t mean squat in the end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beating the Rush.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So everyone agrees that Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the best days to send out an email campaign. Unless your competitors live north of Winterfell, they probably have heard this sage advice as well. This means that you\u2019re facing a ton of competition by sending out emails on the \u201crecommended\u201d days and times.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want your email newsletter to get lost in the hustle, swimming upstream may be your best bet. Although Mondays and Fridays are <em>generally<\/em> not recommended, who is to say they won\u2019t work for you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>It Depends on the Device. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Traditional \u201cbest time to send an email\u201d numbers are being thrown to the wind as user habits change across devices. The standard mid-week, mid-day makes perfect sense for desktop users who are opening emails at work. <strong>Mobile users, on the other hand, tend to be pretty active even late in the evening.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/when-to-send-email-newsletter-1.jpg\" alt=\"when to send email newsletter\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that although activity on mobile devices is plentiful on nights and weekends, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brafton.com\/news\/the-best-time-to-send-email-blasts-depends-on-the-device\">Brafton study shows<\/a> that 55% of consumers open emails on desktops, while only 25% open emails on mobile devices. However, this study was done in 2013, and with users growing more reliant on mobile devices each day, these number could easily change. I also suspect that as businesses learn to craft more mobile-friendly emails, we\u2019ll see greater email open rates on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Demographics: Know Your Audience<\/h2>\n<p>Understanding your demographics is the single most important thing you can do for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/11\/email-list-building\">email marketing success<\/a>.
