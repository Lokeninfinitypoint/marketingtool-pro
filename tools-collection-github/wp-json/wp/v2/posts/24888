If you&#8217;re not familiar with signaling, it refers to behavior whose primary purpose is to &#8220;signal&#8221; or convey something about ourselves to others \u2013 whether or not it&#8217;s true. Generally, what we&#8217;re trying to signal is status. Some people, such as economist Robin Hanson, believe signaling is responsible for a great deal, even most of what humans do. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.econtalk.org\/archives\/2008\/05\/hanson_on_signa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can hear him talk about it in this podcast<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of behavior that could be seen as signaling:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Education <\/strong>\u2013 Advanced degrees or degrees from more prestigious colleges don&#8217;t necessarily indicate more competence, but serve as a signal to hiring managers that you&#8217;re valuable, plus hiring you makes <em>them <\/em>look good. (&#8220;Most of our executive team went to Ivy League schools.&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Health Care<\/strong> \u2013 A lot of health care spending goes into procedures that don&#8217;t necessarily improve outcomes, but make people feel better, because at least we&#8217;re doing something. (&#8220;We&#8217;re doing everything we can.&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Looking Busy<\/strong> \u2013 Ever known someone whose desk was always a mess of papers and who always looked frazzled? You could argue that looking busy is a way of signaling that your role is important \u2013 and keeping the boss off your back.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Voting <\/strong>\u2013 Statistically, voting is as irrational as playing the lottery, but your peers shame you if you don&#8217;t.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One of the best examples I&#8217;ve heard is about dress code conventions in the programming industry. When you interview at a law firm, you have to wear a suit, but if you&#8217;re interviewing for a coding job, looking sloppy is a way of showing how serious you are, because you live in front of a computer and don&#8217;t give a crap how you look. I heard a story about a developer who was running late for an interview and freaking out because he couldn&#8217;t find his stained t-shirt with all the holes in it.<\/p>\n<p>Once you start to think about signaling, <strong>everything seems like signaling<\/strong> \u2013 what people wear, the music they listen to, the cars they drive, where they shop for groceries, where they live, the books they read, AND SO ON. It&#8217;s interesting to think about your own actions this way, too \u2013 as in, am I only going to this concert in order to say that I went? Would I want an iPhone if all my friends didn&#8217;t have one?<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing as Signaling<\/h2>\n<p>Andy didn&#8217;t use the word signaling, but what he was really saying is that many &#8220;Twitter gurus&#8221; use Twitter very transparently to signal to their followers stuff like &#8220;I find awesome articles and share them!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m generous with my knowledge!&#8221; &#8220;I am in demand on the conference circuit!&#8221; &#8220;My blog posts get lots of comments!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m insanely busy because everyone loves me so much!&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of a version of fishing for compliments, but instead of waiting around for someone else to do it,\u00a0you just compliment yourself. (And sure, we all do this now and then, but can&#8217;t you make it a little less obvious?)<\/p>\n<p>Really, though, it&#8217;s not just Twitter \u2013 <strong>marketing is all about signaling<\/strong>. Think about it: Everything we do as marketers is done in order to signal value to potential customers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SEO <\/strong>\u2013 Even SEO is signaling, because being on the first page of the Google results for a head terms tells people you&#8217;re important. People assume those links are more trustworthy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social Media<\/strong> \u2013 Social media might not always have clear ROI, but it&#8217;s important to make it appear that you&#8217;re available and &#8220;with it.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Web Design<\/strong> \u2013 The look of your website conveys a lot about your business. For example, many companies that sell software, especially hosted software, for SMBs adopt a very simplified &#8220;cute&#8221; look to their sites, because that says &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m unintimidating and easy to use and not crazy expensive!&#8221; Contrast this to a big enterprise B2B company like Oracle \u2013 its website is not cute.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blogging <\/strong>\u2013 A big part of the reasoning behind corporate blogging is to signal that you&#8217;re an authority (or &#8220;thought leader&#8221;)\u00a0in your industry and you know your stuff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that marketing is hollow \u2013 or rather, it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Ask yourself if the signal you&#8217;re sending with your business&#8217;s tweets, blog posts and other marketing materials is thinly veiled self-interest. Yes, all businesses act in self-interest ultimately, but the engagement shouldn&#8217;t feel cheap and cynical. I follow plenty of marketers on Twitter who, whether they&#8217;re signaling or not, give me something to laugh about or something to think about often enough that the signal is worth my time.<\/p>\n<h2>Web Marketing Highlights This Week<\/h2>\n<p>Dana Todd says &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/danatodd.wordpress.com\/2011\/02\/23\/news-seo-content-strategy-prime-opportunity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistency is the new authenticity<\/a>.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;if someone presents the same face often enough, it\u2019s perceived as authentic and &#8216;real&#8217; by audiences, even if it\u2019s a complete hoax.
