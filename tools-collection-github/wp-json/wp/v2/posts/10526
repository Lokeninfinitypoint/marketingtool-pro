Here are the best ways to use Google to get your name out there:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Create <em><strong>and verify<\/strong><\/em> your Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n<p>Your Google Business Profile (Google&#8217;s term for your Google listing) is what allows your business to show up in Google Maps results, the local section of Google Search results, and also\u2014when someone types in your business name <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(ideas for creative business names here!)<\/a> and location\u2014the right-side Knowledge Panel in Search results.

Get a website<\/h3>\n<p>A website is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/04\/marketing-collateral\">must-have piece of marketing collateral<\/a> no matter how old-fashioned your business or clients may be. Your website is the go-to for current and prospective customers. Even if they find you on social media or Google, they will want to go to your website and, like your Google listing, it serves to promote your business around the clock.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/websites-landing-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good business website<\/a> not only serves as a promotional tool in and of itself\u2014it tells the story of your business and what you offer, provides contact information, and reflects your brand\u2019s personality and distinguishing characteristics\u2014but it is also essential for measuring and improving the success of your other promotional tactics.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-get-a-website.png\" alt=\"website is one of the best ways to promote your business\" width=\"800\" height=\"780\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, when you run ads, you need landing pages, which live on your website. When you post helpful information on social media, it should link to its home on your website. With all of your marketing channels flowing into your website, you can use analytics to see which strategies are working best and get invaluable insights about your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are completely free solutions to get a website in place for your business, almost inevitably you will need to move to some form of a paid website if you are serious about promoting your business. Having your own domain name, a professional look and feel, and the ability to scale and add features as needed are all essential for growth.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Implement\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">search engine optimization<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing for you to promote your business; it\u2019s another thing for Google to promote your business. SEO is a set of practices that align your business with Google\u2019s ranking algorithm. But because this algorithm has evolved to use machine learning and user behavior to produce the most accurate and quality results for searchers, optimizing for search engines is really just optimizing for searchers\u2014particularly those searching for what you have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>SEO isn\u2019t just one tactic, but many tactics that collectively work together to improve your rank. Also, because Google has superb location-based results, you have just as much of a chance as big retailers to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">show up on the first page of Google<\/a>\u2014 without spending a dime! (With the exception of the costs to get a website, of course).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-seo.png\" alt=\"small businesses appearing on SERP - best way to promote your business\" width=\"800\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>SEO tactics to promote your business include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding relevant (industry- and location-based) keywords to specific places on your website.<\/li>\n<li>Producing original, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a> regularly, with tagged images.<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining high page load speeds and security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more SEO tips, check out this post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">The Top 10 Google Ranking Factors of 2020 (+How to Optimize for Them)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When your business is ranking high in results, Google is basically promoting your business for you\u2014and not just to anyone, but to the people searching for what you have to offer. Doesn&#8217;t get much better than that.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Create a business blog<\/h3>\n<p>We just touched on this in the previous strategy, but content is such an important driver of SEO that it really deserves its own category as a promotional strategy. A blog is not LiveJournal for businesses. Sure, you can create some posts about milestones and events, but a lucrative business blog is one that produces educational content, in your brand voice, around questions and terms your ideal customers are searching in Google.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-business-blog.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business-blog post\" width=\"800\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><em><\/em><\/div>\n<p>These questions and terms are called keywords, and the more content you produce targeting these keywords, the more opportunities you create for your business to show up in search engine results pages. Great blog posts can be any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How-tos and instructional posts<\/li>\n<li>Lists of strategies and resources (top 10, 5 best, 3 crucial, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Q&amp;A or interview writeup with an industry expert<\/li>\n<li>Thought leadership posts<\/li>\n<li>Example\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/26\/networking-email-subject-lines-templates\">template posts<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Guest posts<\/li>\n<li>Customer testimonials or case studies<\/li>\n<li>Seasonal posts\u00a0(such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/november-marketing-ideas\">this one<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For help finding keywords and creating SEO-friendly blog posts, check out these resources:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">What is SEO Content?

Share your content<\/h3>\n<p>A blog that shows your expertise, approachability, and genuine desire to help your audience is the perfect promotional tool for a business. So don\u2019t just publish posts\u2014promote them! On social media, via email newsletters, or even turn them into downloadable guides to help you collect leads. Better yet, if you produce content with shareability in mind, your blog posts will likely get noticed by other credible websites who will mention and link back to your site on their site or social media feeds\u2014promoting your business for you.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember that the more traffic you get to your site, the more important it is to make sure your content loads quickly. For large and\/or growing websites, a CDN can ensure your content gets delivered quickly.\u00a0 There are plenty of options out there\u2014for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/cms\/cdn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot has a CDN option<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; align-content: space-evenly; border-top: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px !important; padding-right: 10px;\">Brought to you by<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/WS-Logo-2023.webp\" alt=\"wordstream logo\" width=\"130\" height=\"auto\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">Ready to grow your business?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 70%; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Unlock the results you\u2019re looking for with technology-backed solutions designed for small businesses and agencies.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin: auto;\"><a style=\"padding: 10px 50px; border-radius: 24px; background-color: #0047ff; color: #f9f5ea; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.background='#0097ff'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.background='#0047ff'\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;itm_content=incontent_links_htmldesign\">Get your free demo<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6. Run Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>While SEO is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/18\/best-marketing-strategies\">best marketing strategies<\/a>, it is a long-term strategy that can take weeks, even months to start seeing results. For more immediate exposure, and if you have the budget, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/08\/should-i-use-adwords\">Google Ads is the way to go<\/a>. Google Ads ads show up at the very top of search engine results pages, above organic and local listings. And of the search engines available, Google is by far the most popular not only because they control the largest share of search engine traffic, but also because of its high level of flexibility, ad building features, and detailed performance metrics.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-google-ads.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business- google ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"466\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Though mastering Google Ads takes some time as well as plenty of trial and error, an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">optimized campaign<\/a> is far worth the investment. Advertising on Google can be done through text ads on the Search Network or branded banner ads on the<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\"> Display Network<\/a>.

These sites tend to be high-traffic, long-standing websites with high domain authority, so it\u2019s not uncommon for your profile page or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">business name<\/a> to show up on the first page of Google through one of these domains. Online listings do not take long to create and can help <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enhance your online presence<\/a>, promoting your business to nearby, high-intent customers.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-local-listings.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business- local listings on the SERP\" width=\"800\" height=\"639\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>7. Create listings on the major directories<\/h3>\n<p>Smaller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">directory sites<\/a> pull data from larger ones, which means that by creating listings on the major sites, you\u2019ll also likely begin showing up on smaller directories automatically. Below is a list of the major directories to start with. All of them are free, but often have paid options for advanced features.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google (see tactic #1)<\/li>\n<li>Yelp<\/li>\n<li>Facebook<\/li>\n<li>Applicable niche directories like TripAdvisor, Angie\u2019s List, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Better Business Bureau<\/li>\n<li>Glassdoor<\/li>\n<li>Foursquare (Even though it\u2019s dead as a social platform, its data is used by thousands of platforms.)<\/li>\n<li>Yellow\/White Pages<\/li>\n<li>Bing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a deeper dive, check out this post on the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 10 Free Local Listing Sites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Optimize your listings<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to create a listing, but it\u2019s another to optimize it. By filling out every field in your profiles, adding photos, and collecting reviews, you can improve the appeal of your business and rank above competitors in searches. It&#8217;s also important to make sure your information in all of your listings is\u00a0consistent with the information on your website. Inconsistencies can cause the Goog to raise an eyebrow about your trustworthiness.\u00a0Finally, be sure to monitor your listing and fix any inaccuracies, which can happen when listings are auto-populated. For more ways to optimize your listings, use the same post I linked to above (but I&#8217;ll link it <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> just because).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-complete-listing.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business-optimized google business listing\" width=\"800\" height=\"541\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Get online customer reviews<\/h3>\n<p>We just mentioned collecting reviews, but because reviews are so important for small and local businesses, they deserve their own section.<\/p>\n<p>Word of mouth is one of, perhaps the most, powerful way of promoting your business to the right people. Testimonials on your own website are great, but reviews on official platforms like Google, Facebook, and Yelp are even better.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-get-more-reviews.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business-google reviews\" width=\"800\" height=\"465\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These websites can increase your exposure, and because they have measures in place to prevent fake or spam reviews, people trust the reviews here more than anywhere else. Plus, reviews are a major ranking factor for local search results. To get reviews, check out these posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">How to Ask for Reviews (with Examples)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">Get More Google Reviews with These\u00a016 Tried and True Tactics<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>10. Monitor and respond to reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Many online directories allow anyone to add a listing, so even if you didn\u2019t list your business, it may still be on there, collecting reviews. Be sure to claim your listings wherever possible, and monitor these sites frequently. This way you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples\/\">respond to reviews<\/a>\u2014which is another great way to promote your business. Not only can you resolve (and even reverse) negative reviews, but the way you answer reviews (positive and negative) can reveal your brand\u2019s values and give potential customers an idea of what it\u2019s like to do business with you.<\/p>\n<div id=\"promote-business-on-social-media\">\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Want to keep the free leads flowing?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/div>\n<h2>How to promote your business on social media<\/h2>\n<p>Social media is another free way to get the word out about your small business.

Potential customers can check out you or your company before doing business with you to find out how many employees you have and to get more information on the background of the company personnel.<\/p>\n<p>You can also promote your business indirectly on LinkedIn by providing\u00a0perspectives in group discussions and\/or providing links to relevant content on your website. Just make sure you&#8217;re not always promoting your own content.<\/p>\n<h3>13.

You can also add videos to your blog posts which can enhance their SEO quality, such as with\u00a0this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/31\/negative-match-types\">WordStream post<\/a> below:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-youtube.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business-youtube video embedded in blog post\" width=\"800\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note also that videos tend to show up in results for very niche searches, sometimes at the very top, like this one:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-videos-niche.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business-how-to videos\" width=\"800\" height=\"942\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>14. Advertise on YouTube<\/h3>\n<p>As with the other paid strategies mentioned in this post, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/27\/youtube-advertising\">YouTube advertising<\/a> can be an investment that pays off if it&#8217;s done right. You can advertise on YouTube by creating video ads that play before videos in relevant categories, or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/13\/youtube-ad-placements\">through text ads<\/a> that appear in search results:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-youtube-advertising.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014youtube advertising\" width=\"800\" height=\"465\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>15. Engage your audience on Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>Despite being one of the more recently launched\u00a0social media platforms, Instagram is the third most popular platform out there. With its diverse\u00a0posting formats (permanent images, short-lived\u00a0Stories, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/22\/instagram-tv\">IGTV<\/a> series, live sessions, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/06\/instagram-story-highlights\">Story Highlights<\/a>, and more), there exists a variety of ways to use Instagram to engage your audience and promote your business. You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promote your sales and deals with hashtags to expand your reach.<\/li>\n<li>Run contests with a free or discounted product\/service to generate positive buzz (and obtain\u00a0a list of leads to reach out to).<\/li>\n<li>Offer advice and tutorials to stand out as a go-to resource.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more ways to promote your business on Instagram, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">11 Instagram marketing tips<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">16. Share on Twitter<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Twitter is another free channel that can be used to promote your business online\u2014mainly if your audience is comprised of 18-24 year-olds.\u00a0It tends to require a bit more activity to build an audience, but if you\u2019re consistently active, you can master the platform and experience its benefits.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promote your products or services<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-twitter.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014twitter\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Or simply invite nearby customers to stop in:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-twitter-bookshop.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business twitter post inviting customers to stop by\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>17. Give Pinterest a shot<\/h3>\n<p>While Pinterest is fundamentally focused on sharing photos, the fact that your photos can link back to your website creates an opportunity to promote your business and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">drive more traffic to your site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest is especially powerful for ecommerce businesses looking to reach a female audience (Pinterest users are <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/pinterest-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heavily skewed towards the female demographic<\/a>).\u00a0 If this fits your profile, you may want to think about getting active on the Pinterest network.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Try out TikTok<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok was only launched in 2016, but it has <a href=\"https:\/\/datareportal.com\/social-media-users?rq=tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already surpassed Twitter<\/a>, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Pinterest in active users. Its ease of use in creating compelling videos with special effects makes it a great video marketing platform\u2014and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">not just for Zillenials<\/a>. You can jump right on the platform to provide how-to, tutorial, or behind-the-scenes videos, but you may want to promote your new Tik Tok\u00a0channel\u00a0across other networks, as with the example below:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-tiktok.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014Tiktok video shared on facebook\" width=\"600\" height=\"766\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>19. Join online communities<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to get a leg up is to offer a hand up to others. Join communities and groups relevant to your business or industry on LinkedIn, Reddit, and Facebook, and offer people good advice and suggestions when they have problems or questions. (Make sure your own profile information points back to your business, of course.)<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-linkedin-groups.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014online communities like linkedin groups\" width=\"800\" height=\"754\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is a great way to build a genuine reputation and form\u00a0solid connections with people relevant to your work. What goes around generally comes around. And remember that while you\u2019re helping one person with their query, you\u2019re being observed by a thousand silent others who will see your name and what you\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Try an influencer marketing collaboration<\/h3>\n<p>Your business can be a part of communities both geographically-based and niche-focused, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/21\/social-media-influence\">influencers<\/a> are celebrities within your niche. They\u2019re not on the red carpet or hosting their own talk shows, but they are highly respected, wildly popular, and deeply trusted experts <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">in your niche<\/a>. Influencers have a large social media and\/or blog following, which means that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/19\/influencer-marketing-content-promotion\">getting mentioned or featured by one of these influencers<\/a> can promote your business to a massive, relevant audience.<\/p>\n<p>Influencer marketing is a careful strategy, however. Before reaching out to an influencer, take the time to familiarize with their accounts across all networks;\u00a0comment on, like, and share their content;\u00a0and be sure to approach them with a specific ask and something of equal value in exchange. For example, you might offer them a month of free classes in exchange for a review on their blog and mentions on social media. Or you might offer to write a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality<\/a> guest post on their blog that benefits their audience while also supplying a backlink to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an influencer in the automotive niche (David Patterson)\u00a0promoting a local auto shop:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-influencer-collaboration.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014instagram influencer collaboration\" width=\"800\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And here&#8217;s an example of an influencer in the home and parenting niche (Leticia Barr) promoting FabFitFun:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-influencer-collaboration-techsavvymama.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business influencer collaboration\" width=\"800\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>21. Invest in social media advertising<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/30\/social-media-advertising-tips\">Social media advertising <\/a>is among the most forward-thinking, highly-utilized, and profitable forms of digital advertising today. More than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/278414\/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users\/\">3.6 BILLION<\/a> people use it and it\u2019s constantly evolving to offer ease-of-use and exceptional value for your advertising dollar. When done right, paid social promotes your business to a highly targeted audience with these advantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Familiarity: M<\/strong>eet people on the channels they use most.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:<\/strong>\u00a0Advanced targeting ensures your ads are shown to only the most relevant audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Supporting content:<\/strong>\u00a0Your organic posts serve to support your sponsored posts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brand loyalty:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">Attracting more followers<\/a> to your accounts helps to build community and loyalty around your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Analytics<\/strong>: Know what\u2019s working so you can allot your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/28\/small-business-budget\">budget<\/a> accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"promote-business-in-community\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to promote your business in your community<\/h2>\n<p>For <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/24\/local-marketing-tips\">local businesses<\/a>, the community is a critical component of their success. Retailers and restaurants understand this implicitly, of course, and even those businesses focused more on the wider world still have a considerable attachment to the place or places in which they operate. That said, let&#8217;s talk about a few <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ways to market your small business<\/a> in your community.<\/p>\n<h3>22. Strive to get local press<\/h3>\n<p>For some reason, the idea of pitching your business happenings to the local press feels intimidating, but the truth is, local blogs, newspapers, online publications are always on the hunt for fresh content.<\/p>\n<p>Reach out to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/now-is-the-time-to-lean-into-local-news\/\">local news <\/a>sources and see if you can contribute an article\u2014whether it\u2019s a thought leadership piece, a list of resources, or a newsworthy update about your business. If your business\u2019s story is compelling enough, you might even be able to get someone else to publish a featured write-up.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-local-newspaper.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business local press\" width=\"788\" height=\"473\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can also ask to write about an event you are hosting in your community, or invite a local writer to attend for free in exchange for a recap.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a little more budget, you may even consider a public relations partner, firm, or app to get your stories published in multiple media sources. If your budget is a little bit lower, you can publish your own press releases through companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.prweb.com<\/a>. These press releases may get picked up by some media outlets and they can also help your search engine optimization by providing links back to your website.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">learn how to write a great press release here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>23. Form partnerships<\/h3>\n<p>Partnering with non-competitive businesses that serve the same clientele can be a great way to promote your business in your local network.\u00a0Once you have established a relationship, you can cross-promote each other\u2019s services through your email lists and in-store flyers or coupons, or by engaging them through social media.\u00a0Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative to maximize the promotional value of the partnership.<\/p>\n<h3>24. Network network network<\/h3>\n<p>Attending local networking events is a great way to increase your presence in your community. This works better for some types of businesses than others. If you provide services directly to other small businesses or consumers, then local networking is going to be far more rewarding than if you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">sell products online<\/a>, for example. However, every kind of networking helps, even if it\u2019s just to share ideas and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/25\/inspiring-instagram-accounts\">inspiration<\/a> with other business owners.<\/p>\n<p>Whether online or offline, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/01\/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses\">inexpensive marketing techniques<\/a> like these can get your business humming with the energy from new customers and clients.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do partake in networking (I&#8217;m not trying to tell you how to live your life, but you should), do not miss out on my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/26\/networking-email-subject-lines-templates\">nine networking email templates<\/a>, like the one below:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-network.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014networking email\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>25. Attend, host, or sponsor local events<\/h3>\n<p>Even in a world that is increasingly digital, attending, hosting, or sponsoring\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">events in your community<\/a>\u00a0is a great way to promote your business while strengthening your connection with local customers.<\/p>\n<p>You could run a class at your location, offer to teach a class at a school, library, or other local establishment, or even just host a fun <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/november-marketing-ideas\">seasonal<\/a> and\/or family-oriented event. Leverage the time you put into creating and teaching the class by having a friend take video of you teaching, then put that video on your website and on YouTube.<\/p>\n<h3>26. Try out direct mail<\/h3>\n<p>Despite the dominance of digital media today, sending postcards, flyers, letters, or other types of mail can still be a very effective way to promote your business to nearby customers. One of the biggest challenges with this promotional method is that you can\u2019t exactly target your mailings, so you\u2019ll need to print out and send a high volume of mail in order to get a response. The benefit is that if you get it right, promoting your business through the mail can help you get new customers with a very repeatable process.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-direct-mail.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014direct mail\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You could also send your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers<\/a> little gift packages during the holidays to keep them coming back and (most likely) promoting your business to their friends and family.<\/p>\n<h3>27. Advertise locally and offline<\/h3>\n<p>Newspapers, magazines, radio, and even television are some other traditional places for paying to promote your business.\u00a0If you are considering promoting your business through <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/what-is-print-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">print ads<\/a> or any of these offline strategies, the key is to make sure you are tracking everything so that you can know the effectiveness. For more local advertising tips, head here: <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Effective Local Advertising Ideas for Small Businesses<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"other-ways-to-promote-business\"><\/div>\n<h2>Other effective ways of promoting your business<\/h2>\n<p>These three promotional strategies are last but definitely\u00a0least\u2014they&#8217;re just a bit miscellaneous with regard to the way I grouped the strategies in this post.<\/p>\n<h3>28. Attend trade shows<\/h3>\n<p>If you are targeting a national audience and you want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/facebook-ecommerce-tips\">sell your products<\/a> to retailers, going to a big trade show might make sense. If you are unsure of how beneficial the trade show will be for you, and you have some time to figure it out, you might consider just attending as a visitor before investing the money in your own booth. If you have a good relationship with a company already planning on exhibiting at a trade show, they may let you \u201chang out\u201d in their booth for a portion of time, where you can observe and learn, and maybe even promote your business free of charge.<\/p>\n<h3>29. Run email marketing campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Email marketing has been around for ages, but the strategy has by no means become less effective over time. In fact, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/29\/email-marketing-statistics\">77%<\/a> of people prefer to get permission-based promotional messages via email versus other modes of communication. Email is a popular channel for consumers and businesses alike:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>People like to stay informed.<\/li>\n<li>People constantly check their email.<\/li>\n<li>Email offers detailed reporting.<\/li>\n<li>You can segment your lists for targeted, personalized emails.<\/li>\n<li>Email marketing generates a <a href=\"https:\/\/dma.org.uk\/uploads\/misc\/589c5b9eaaca9-marketer-email-tracking-report-2017_589c5b9eaabde.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30x<\/a>\u00a0average return on investment.<\/li>\n<li>Email marketing platforms offer flexibility, creativity, and most importantly, ease of use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-promote-business-email-marketing.png\" alt=\"best ways to promote your business\u2014email marketing\" width=\"800\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For more tips on using email marketing, check out my post on\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">How to Write Undelete-able Promotional Emails<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>30. Make advocates out of your employees<\/h3>\n<p>Good leadership and proper treatment of your employees will naturally turn them into advocates for your business.\u00a0Hold brainstorm sessions, encourage\u00a0employee blog post contributions, host fireside chats, get them involved in local events, run family and friend promotions\u2014value them and they will value the business they work for. You can then\u00a0encourage social media sharing and equip them with news and tools to effortlessly spread the word about your business.<\/p>\n<h2>How to advertise your business: The full list<\/h2>\n<p>There is a plethora of options when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">promoting your business<\/a>, no matter your budget.
