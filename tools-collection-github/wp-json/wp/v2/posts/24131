But here\u2019s a super-quick refresher on what you\u2019ll need to do in order to SEO your web content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword research<\/strong>: If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">generate traffic through search<\/a>, it\u2019s best to do keyword research <em>before<\/em> you start writing. This way, you can focus on keywords for which a certain amount of search volume already exists \u2013 in other words, write toward topics (or find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-niche-finder\">keyword niches<\/a>!) that people are already searching for information about.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keyword optimization<\/strong>: Know where and how to use keywords in your content for maximum searchability. (Learn more in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">complete guide to on-page SEO<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content organization<\/strong>: The content on your site should be organized in a logical way. This is not only good for SEO, it also helps visitors on your site find other related content easily. (The longer they stay on your site, the better.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content promotion<\/strong>: Increase visibility to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/29\/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor\">new content you create<\/a> by sharing it on social networks and building links to your content (both internally and from external sites).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A quick word on intentions<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that if <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">search engine traffic <\/a>is your <em>only<\/em> goal, your results will probably suffer. In order to please both the search engines (who will reward you with high rankings over time) and potential customers and return visitors, you need to offer value above and beyond search engine optimization. In other words, don\u2019t produce \u201cthin\u201d content that ranks and get clicks, but doesn\u2019t provide any additional value to the search engine user. Sites that promote \u201cthin,\u201d low-value content run the risk of being penalized by Google; they also tend to have high bounce rates and low conversion rates.<\/p>\n<div id=\"types\"><\/div>\n<h2>Types of SEO content<\/h2>\n<p>SEO content can include any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product pages<\/strong> \u2013 These are the bread and butter of any retail e-commerce site. A good product page can serve as both <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/what-is-seo\">SEO<\/a> content and a PPC landing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blog posts <\/strong>\u2013 A blog is one of the easiest ways to create a regular stream of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\">effective SEO content<\/a>. In general, blog posts are more engaging and more likely to attract links than product pages, so they can be a great way to build some authority for your site. Keep in mind that blogs are very flexible, and you can use them to host any of the below types of content in this list.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/examples-blog-post-template.png\" alt=\"examples blog post template\" width=\"400\" height=\"517\" class=\"size-full wp-image-53941 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/examples-blog-post-template.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/examples-blog-post-template-232x300.png 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">Head here for our free SEO-optimized blog post templates<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Articles <\/strong>\u2013 Think news article, interview, or feature piece. This is the main kind of content you\u2019ll find on most newspaper- or magazine-style websites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lists <\/strong>\u2013 A list is really just a kind of article, but framing it as a list (such as \u201c10 Ways to Lower Your Energy Bill\u201d or \u201c101 Things I Hate About Google\u201d) makes it easier to scan. These types of titles also seem to be more clickable when found in search results or in social media feeds. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/20\/social-signals-for-seo\">social signals do impact SEO<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Guides <\/strong>\u2013 A guide is a longer piece of content that explains in detail how to do something. (Guides are often broken up onto multiple web pages, though it\u2019s a best practice to allow users to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/16\/google-tests-infinite-scroll-devalues-pagination\">view long content as a single page<\/a> if they wish.) You can post a full guide on your website, or you can post a summary or excerpt, requiring visitors to fill out a registration form to read the full guide. This can be a good way to generate leads, but keep in mind that putting up a registration wall will likely reduce the amount of SEO traffic you can drive to that guide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Videos<\/strong> \u2013 In general there are fewer videos on the web than pages of text; consequently, it can be easier to rank on the first page for a competitive keyword by creating a video instead of an article. Depending on what type of site or business you run, videos can be a great way to attract and reach an audience. Consider creating video tutorials of how to use your products. Or illustrate a process that is related to your business \u2013 for example, a plumber could make a video showing how to unclog a sink. (A note on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/01\/seo-case-study\">SEO<\/a>: You might consider including a text transcript of your video. Here are some additional <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/11\/rank-on-google-with-video-content-part-two\">tips for optimizing videos<\/a>.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Infographics<\/strong> \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/26\/infographic-marketing-interview\">Infographics<\/a>, or large-format images that contain a lot of data (often in the form of graphs or charts) on a single subject, can rack up a lot of page views and links. However, because so much of the content is embedded in the image and therefore not readable as text by search engines, it\u2019s important to carefully optimize the rest of the page. You can use one of these five free <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/13\/infographic-templates\">infographic templates<\/a> to get started.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slideshows <\/strong>\u2013 A slideshow is a way to display a series of related images. Sometimes pictures are more important than text \u2013 say you\u2019re trying to show what all the stars wore to the Oscars. Here again, SEO of your title, captions, image file names and so on is important because there is less for the search engines to \u201cread.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Glossaries <\/strong>\u2013 I swear more people use Google to look up terms than they use a dictionary. (Do you even know where your dictionary is?) If you work in a specialized industry, a well built-out glossary can be a good way to capture some search traffic. Think cooking terms, medical terms, fashion terms, architectural terms \u2026<\/li>\n<li><strong>Directories <\/strong>\u2013 A directory is a useful taxonomy of links to sites or resources around a given topic. For example, a perfume blog might create a directory of places to buy perfume, from major department stores to independent shops around the country.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are just some of the basic types of SEO content, but don\u2019t let this list limit you \u2013 the possibilities are virtually endless.<\/p>\n<div id=\"strategy\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to Develop an SEO Content Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been producing content in a haphazard manner, hoping and praying that some of it eventually ranks, it\u2019s time to buckle down and commit to a more methodical SEO <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/04\/content-strategy-for-the-web\">content strategy for the web<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four steps to defining and refining your SEO <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/28\/content-strategy\">content strategy<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3>Define your goals<\/h3>\n<p>First, determine your goals as a website or business. Are you looking to drive sales through your website? Do you monetize your site via ads and therefore just want to increase traffic and return readership? Your goals will determine what types of content you should focus on.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate-product-pages-1.png\" alt=\"Slick, glossy online product page for razors\" width=\"677\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A great example of a minimal, yet sleek and elegant, product page<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re primarily trying to drive product sales, your primary focus should be attractive, informative product pages that are optimized for both search and conversions. Your secondary focus could be helpful blog content that illustrates when and how to use your products, linking to those pages where relevant (it\u2019s best if your blog is not entirely self-promotional, though).<\/p>\n<p>If your site operates on an advertising model and the goal is to attract new readers through search, you\u2019ll want to focus on rich content (such as long-form articles or video resources that are informative, entertaining or both) with \u201cstickiness\u201d (\u201csticky\u201d content keeps visitors on your site longer or encourages them to return).<\/p>\n<h3>Consider your audience<\/h3>\n<p>Know your audience \u2013 surveys and your analytics software can help you get a better picture of your typical visitor or client. Consider developing marketing personas, or characters that represent your ideal site visitors and customers. Then think about what kinds of content those personas would be looking for.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buyer-personas-demographics-2-1.png\" alt=\"Buyer personas concept \" width=\"670\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, if you operate a B2B website that targets C-level executives, you might want to create high-level white papers that can be downloaded and saved to read later.<\/p>\n<p>If your business targets teens and tweens, you might want to focus on frequent updates with less text and more images and video. You\u2019ll also want to be sure your site is optimized for mobile usage.<\/p>\n<h3>Create an editorial calendar<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have an idea of who you are targeting and why, you can start to build out an editorial calendar. An editorial calendar is a schedule that dictates when you will publish new content and what type of content it will be. This will help you stick to a regular schedule (it\u2019s especially important to create new content on a regular basis if you have a blog), as well as prevent you from scrambling to come up with a topic for new content at the last minute.<\/p>\n<p>A few tips for creating and adhering to an editorial calendar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use Outlook (or Google Calendar)<\/strong> \u2013 Share the editorial calendar with your whole marketing team. Set up reminders for authors so they get a notification when a deadline is coming up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consider creating ongoing features<\/strong> \u2013 For example, a food blog might do a meatless recipe every Monday. Many blogs do link roundups once per week (<a href=\"\/category\/wordstream-blog-tags\/online-marketing-blog-roundup\">including this one<\/a>). Create a category page for each ongoing feature, so visitors can find all of your Meatless Monday recipes or link roundups in one place.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give yourself plenty of lead time <\/strong>when producing more complicated types of content, such as videos and infographics. These often need multiple rounds of edits to perfect and can be more complicated to optimize for search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t plan too far out in advance <\/strong>\u2013 Calendars often get derailed after a month or two, due to changes in marketing goals, budgets, or staff, so don\u2019t try to plan out a schedule for the next year and risk wasting a lot of time and effort.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Analyze and re-assess<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, stay on top of your site\u2019s analytics. Regularly analyze your SEO content through both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\">content audits<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">SEO audits<\/a> (or even a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/24\/website-audit-checklist\">whole dang site audit<\/a>) to see what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. There are plenty of tools and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/31\/website-graders\">website graders<\/a> to help with this. Good measures of success and engagement include page views, links, comments (on blog posts and some other types of content), social shares (Facebook likes, tweets, etc.), and conversion rates. Your analysis should have two goals:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Study your successes so you can repeat those strategies<\/strong> \u2013 Look for patterns. Does your audience love videos? Then make more videos! Adjust your editorial calendar going forward so you can focus more time and effort on the content types that really resonate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Carve out time for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">updating and improving older SEO content<\/a><\/strong> \u2013 If you tried to optimize an article for a certain keyword, but it\u2019s getting more traffic for a different variation of that keyword, then go back in and re-optimize it for the new keyword. You might be able to significantly increase traffic by putting that keyword in the title, for example.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep your site in check:\u00a0<\/strong>It&#8217;s important to regularly assess your website, both as a whole and with individual pages, t make sure it&#8217;s optimized for Google and search engines.
