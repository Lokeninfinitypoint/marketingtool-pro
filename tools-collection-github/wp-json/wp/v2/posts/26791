On the other hand you might envision a content marketer as an artistically blessed writer whose eloquent way with words can talk her out of any dilemma.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4c32ce41-7a16-4cf6-a037-f7a0d2a7f693\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc.png\" alt=\"Content marketing for ppc\" width=\"449\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These stereotypes may or may not be true, but being one who wears both hats, I\u2019ve found that paid search marketers could truly benefit from putting on a content marketing hat from time to time. Check out the <strong>3 game-changing ways PPC marketers can benefit from thinking like content marketers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Headline Creation Requires Research &amp; a Spark of Creativity<\/h2>\n<p>What headlines received the highest clicks and engagement rates across all channels? This might sound like a common question <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/28\/free-content-marketing-tools\">for content marketers<\/a> to ask when evaluating their monthly performance, but it\u2019s also one that PPC marketers should be asking before drafting their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">ad text headlines<\/a>. The headline of an ad often the only thing a searcher reads, making it your one and only chance of gaining a website visitor and potential conversion. When you\u2019re sitting on a page next to your competitors who have a carefully crafted ad, yours needs to stand out. So what can be done?<\/p>\n<h3>Use your most engaging headlines on your website and social channels within your ads<\/h3>\n<p>Keep an eye on metrics like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">social shares<\/a>, traffic, clicks, and conversion rates on your business\u2019s blog and social networks. While the audiences may vary on each platform, the chances of seeing success with a headline that stood out against the pack are typically high. Steal from your other channels to create PPC ad headlines that are likely to see results.<\/p>\n<h3>Steal ideas from Buzzfeed<\/h3>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t wasted a good hour+ on Buzzfeed, whether it be taking a quiz to find out which Friends character you are or reading about 33 Insanely Clever Things Your Small Apartment Needs, then you\u2019re either really important or unfamiliar with the internet. The internet media company has become one of the most successful and well-known sources of daily distraction for employees struggling through their 9-5 workdays. Even though a lot of Buzzfeed\u2019s content might seem like a mindless distraction, they\u2019re doing something right with over 200 million monthly unique visitors. PPC marketers should steal ideas from Buzzfeed\u2019s trending blog titles and make them relevant to their industry to craft more clickable headlines.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"04d0ed90-6f92-44a7-9229-a709becdde74\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-buzzfeed.png\" width=\"219\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Use Buzzsumo to Find Engaging Headlines<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/06\/buzzsumo-for-content-marketing\">Buzzsumo<\/a> is the best side-kick for marketers searching for their next content idea. Whether it be a topic, keyword or website, you can type anything into the Buzzsumo search box and then filter by date to see which pieces of content received the highest amount of social shares over a given period of time. How is this helpful? Stealing the ideas from pieces of content that people were not only willing to click on, but willing to share across their social networks, proves that the headline is a true winner in the resonating category. PPC marketers can adapt these ideas for their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/21\/adwords-ads\">ad headlines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cfd40ab0-5bd3-4304-9a98-3a051a233c84\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-buzzsumo-1.png\" alt=\"buzzsumo for ppc\" width=\"1346\" height=\"528\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Combine BuzzFeed and Buzzsumo to 3X Your Ad CTR\u2019s<\/h3>\n<p>The ultimate hack is to combine the two. In the example below I typed \u201cbuzzfeed.com\u201d into my Buzzsumo search bar to land me with this insanely sharable article. I stole the idea of the article, but adapted it to my client\u2019s nutrition business to create this unicorn ad with a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/12\/ad-ctr\">click-worthy headline<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"43451844-2750-43c2-a896-f76cebd97d88\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-both.png\" width=\"1133\" height=\"477\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#2: Compelling Storytelling Is Critical<\/h2>\n<p>PPC marketers need to craft the entire search journey, from first query to last click, as a cohesive experience. If you\u2019re searching for a new pair of winter boots and you\u2019re directed to a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/02\/landing-page-tips-and-tricks\">landing page<\/a> selling jackets, then you\u2019re probably going to bounce back to Google, right? Relating keywords to ad text to landing page might seem like one of those <a href=\"\/learn\">101 best practices<\/a> that we all first learn when diving into the PPC space, but how many of you are actually ensuring your experience comes full-circle?<\/p>\n<p>All great content marketers have one thing in common: they\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/05\/business-storytelling\">incredible storytellers<\/a>. Stories have the power to shake us, make us move, and act, because our brains are drawn to them. As humans we love stories so much that we have to be trained to not fall for anecdotal evidence.<\/p>\n<p>What does this have to do with PPC? Everything. Your keywords, ads, and landing pages should tell a cohesive and engaging story. From the search query you can gain an understanding into what the searcher is looking for, then the ad can tell the story of how you will solve their problem, and finally the landing page gives you full range to engage your searcher with a moving conclusion that will (hopefully) drive them to act (i.e. convert).<\/p>\n<p>Check out the example below where I typed in the search \u201clearn how to code in Boston,\u201d I was then directed to the ad below reflecting the search query within the ad and providing me with some additional information of what I\u2019d find if I decided to click on the ad.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3180ab8-9423-46bf-aaca-92bda39c800a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-google.png\" width=\"637\" height=\"268\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was then directed to <a href=\"https:\/\/generalassemb.ly\/education\/web-development-immersive\">this extensive landing page<\/a>, which was clearly designed from a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/18\/curata-content-marketing\">content marketing mind-set<\/a>. Some elements PPC marketers should take note of include the storytelling components of a student\u2019s experiences and also hiring manager\u2019s perspective on the program.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5ba2fb93-c415-4f87-9e2d-015cc40457c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-general.png\" width=\"756\" height=\"826\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s even a section outlining the typical day in the life of a student.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d4d73792-58cb-4ac7-8062-f56fea366cf3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-for-ppc-student.png\" width=\"541\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>TAKEAWAY<\/strong>: Create a cohesive experience when crafting your keywords, ads, and landing pages, and visualize each stage of the search experience as a story where an engaging ending occurs on the landing page, which inspires the searcher to act (as in fill out your lead form or make a purchase).<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Brainstorming Should be a Continuous Process<\/h2>\n<p>We often gain inspiration from the most spontaneous places at the most unpredictable times.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing successful content marketers do regularly is brainstorm, whether it be in the shower before work, while running on the treadmill or during a fascinating conversation with a stranger at your neighborhood bar. When a good idea pops up they jot it down, create it, and bring it to life through a blog post, infographic, or e-book.<\/p>\n<p>PPC marketers should be doing the same. Whether it be an advanced remarketing tactic that a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/17\/retail-marketing\">retail company used<\/a> successfully on you or a set of keywords you just realized may be worth bidding on. These realizations and opportunities to expand what you\u2019re currently doing with your paid search campaigns shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. You should always be thinking of how to innovate further, do more, and be better with PPC because you don\u2019t want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/03\/small-business-ppc-management\">compete with your competitors<\/a>, you want to make it so there\u2019s no longer competition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PPC marketers should be putting on a content marketing hat from time to time.
