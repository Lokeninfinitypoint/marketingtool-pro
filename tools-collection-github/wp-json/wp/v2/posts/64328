Basically: keep disruptive, unskippable, unexpected, or obstructive ads out of your ad destinations.\u00a0 And if you have any currently running, you&#8217;ll want to remove those before October.<br \/>\n<a id=\"disapproval\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What happens if you violate the destination experience policy?<\/h2>\n<p>Just like with any policy violation, your ad will be disapproved\u2014meaning, it will be paused (or not allowed to go live in the first place), you\u2019ll be notified, and you won\u2019t be able to run the ad until you fix the disapproval. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">We cover Google Ads disapprovals here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can, however, appeal disapprovals. Because ads go through an algorithmic approval process, ads are more often than not disapproved when they haven\u2019t violated a policy. So if your ad is disapproved, you&#8217;ll see the option to submit the changed ad or dispute the decision, like with the example below:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-disapproval-appeal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"775\" height=\"275\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50903\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-disapproval-appeal.jpg 775w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-disapproval-appeal-480x170.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 775px, 100vw\" \/>Egregious violations, as well as repeated disapprovals (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/28\/google-ads-three-strikes-policy-program\">we cover the 3-strikes policy here<\/a>) can result in account suspension. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/7187501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here\u2019s what Google says about policy violation.<\/a><br \/>\n<a id=\"action\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What do you need to do?<\/h2>\n<p>This shouldn&#8217;t impact you if your ads go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">high-quality, trustworthy landing pages\u00a0<\/a>on your site and if your site is free of ads. But it&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry. Here are the two things you should do to ensure your ads don&#8217;t incur any disapprovals.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Get familiar with the Better Ads Standards<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterads.org\/standards\/\">Better Ads Standards<\/a> is a set of standards created by the Coalition for Better Ads, from surveying users on hundreds of ad experiences, to make sure your ads&#8217; destination landing page, apps, mobile sites, and videos are free of disruptive, unexpected, obnoxious or frustrating ads.<\/p>\n<p>The page itself defines <strong>18 specific experiences<\/strong> that fall below the Better Ads Standards, with an easy definition and GIF to help you understand each one. For example, video ads that auto-play with the sound on. Or large, sticky banner ads that take up more than 30% of the screen. My recap below will help you understand it all, but the page itself is, of course, the best resource with all of the details.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>It&#8217;s important to note that these are for <strong>secondary ads within a primary ad&#8217;s destination.<\/strong> So a nonskippable video ad on YouTube is not a disallowed experience. But if you have an ad that goes to a landing page that a user can&#8217;t view until they&#8217;ve watched 6 seconds of a video, then that is a disallowed experience.<\/p><\/div><\/div>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use the Ad Experience Report<\/h3>\n<p>Also as mentioned above, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/ad-experience-unverified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Ad Experience Report<\/a> is a tool that will find poor ad destination experiences on your site and recommend user-friendly alternatives. There are four <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webtools\/answer\/7072706#review_status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review statuses defined by Google<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not reviewed:<\/strong> Your site hasn&#8217;t been reviewed yet. All you can really do here is go through your ad experiences manually and fix any potential violations ahead of time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Passing:\u00a0<\/strong>Congrats! You have no obnoxious ad experiences on your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Failing: <\/strong>This means Google has found experiences that violate or fall below the Better Ads Standards. If this is the case, the site owner will get an email. Once you fix the issues, you can submit your site for a second review. If you don&#8217;t fix them within 30 days, Chrome will filter your ads until you do.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Review pending:\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>You&#8217;ll see this once you&#8217;ve re-submitted a failed site for review.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ad-experience-report.png\" alt=\"google ads experience report\" width=\"720\" height=\"386\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ad-experience-report.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ad-experience-report-480x257.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note that this report is part of Google Search Console, so you\u2019ll need to verify ownership of your site in order to access the report.<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9008080?hl=en\"> Here are Google\u2019s instructions to verify site ownership.<\/a><br \/>\n<a id=\"bas\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What are the Better Ads Standards?<\/h2>\n<p>As promised, here is an overview on the types of ad destination experiences you&#8217;ll want to remove from current ads and keep out of future campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>Destination requirements policy<\/h3>\n<p>First up, we have <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6368661?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctroubleshooter-destination-not-crawlable\">Google&#8217;s official Destination requirements<\/a>.
