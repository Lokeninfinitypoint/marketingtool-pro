Organic clicks are plummeting<\/h3>\n<p>The data makes it clear: A Semrush study of 10,000 informational keywords found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-generated summaries significantly reduced both organic and paid click-through rates<\/a>. Meanwhile, Moz\u2019s latest research suggests that AI Overviews could slash organic traffic by <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-are-they-affecting-your-search-results-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18% to 64%<\/a>, particularly for websites that provide straightforward informational content.<\/p>\n<p>This shift is particularly concerning for businesses that rely on organic traffic to generate leads and revenue. If users no longer have to click through to find the information they need, websites will see fewer visits, which will lead to massive losses in revenue.<\/p>\n<h4>How to adapt and maintain traffic<\/h4>\n<p>Rather than competing with AI-generated summaries, businesses should focus on creating content that AI can\u2019t easily replicate or condense. The key is to provide value beyond a quick answer by offering depth, originality, and real-world application.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create content with depth and complexity: <\/strong>AI excels at summarization but struggles with in-depth analysis. Publishing comprehensive, expert-backed content that explores topics from multiple angles will make your content harder to replace.\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Example<\/em><\/strong><em>: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-chrome-sale\">Google May Have to Sell Chrome: What You Need to Know<\/a>.

While an AI Overview might summarize the basic facts, it can\u2019t capture the nuance of potential market impacts and forward-looking insights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leverage original research and unique data: <\/strong>AI models pull information from existing sources, which means they cannot generate new data on their own.

Content summaries can misrepresent brands<\/h3>\n<p>AI-generated summaries pull information from multiple sources, often stripping away essential context or excluding critical details. This can result in misrepresentation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\">brand\u2019s messaging<\/a>, leading to confusion, diminished trust, and lost conversions. Unlike human-curated content, AI Overviews do not prioritize brand intent, which means that businesses risk losing control over how they are perceived in search results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s an example of how AI summaries can cause problems:<\/strong> In February 2025, Google&#8217;s AI chatbot, Gemini AI, falsely claimed in a Super Bowl ad that Gouda cheese accounts for &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2025\/02\/06\/business\/google-edited-super-bowl-ad-after-viewers-cited-by-gemini-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50-60%<\/a> of the world&#8217;s cheese consumption.&#8221; This faulty statistic sparked social media backlash and led Google to quietly edit the ad to remove the incorrect information. The incident underscored how AI-generated content can disseminate false information, potentially misleading audiences and harming brand credibility.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy.webp\" alt=\"google ai showing incorrect stat for gouda consumption\" width=\"1200\" height=\"889\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy-980x726.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy-480x356.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2025\/02\/06\/business\/google-edited-super-bowl-ad-after-viewers-cited-by-gemini-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h4>How to maintain control over your brand message<\/h4>\n<p>While businesses cannot directly control AI-generated summaries, they can take proactive steps to influence how AI interprets their content. The key is to structure content in a way that reinforces brand messaging and ensures that AI pulls the most relevant details.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure content with AI-friendly summaries: <\/strong>Since AI prioritizes content that is easy to extract and summarize, brands should create clearly defined sections that highlight key takeaways.\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cThink of AI Overviews like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-citations\">citations<\/a>: Write your content as if it&#8217;s the perfect key takeaway someone would highlight in an article. AI Overviews prioritize clear, helpful information, so focus on easy-to-understand definitions, examples, and explanations without burying them in long paragraphs or filler. Formatting matters too. Based on my experience, AI Overviews rely on header hierarchy to extract key information,\u201d said Rease Rios, Senior Content Marketing Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Postman<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-example-with-content-source.webp\" alt=\"ai overview example for how to clean a pool with content source example\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91580\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-example-with-content-source.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-example-with-content-source-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use structured data to reinforce key information: \u201c<\/strong>Formatting matters too.

Businesses can reduce the risk of AI misinterpretation by adding structured data that defines brand values, product benefits, and unique selling propositions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ensure brand values and USPs appear early in the content: <\/strong>AI often pulls information from the beginning of an article or webpage. Placing a company\u2019s mission, differentiators, and core value propositions within the first few sentences increases the chances that AI will include them in its summary.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Publish authoritative content across multiple trusted sources: <\/strong>Since AI gathers information from a variety of sources, businesses can reinforce their messaging by ensuring consistency across multiple platforms. Guest posts, PR mentions, and collaborations with authoritative industry websites can help shape the data AI pulls when generating summaries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <strong>Need help creating your unique value proposition?<\/strong>\u00a0Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"authority-signals-matter-more-than-ever\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Authority signals matter more than ever<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cAuthority matters because internet users get savvier every day,\u201d Rease said.<\/p>\n<p>Google recognizes that, so its AI Overviews tend to prioritize content from authoritative sources, making it significantly harder for smaller or newer websites to gain visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Since AI-generated summaries pull information from sources deemed trustworthy by Google, businesses without an established <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">online reputation<\/a> risk being overshadowed by industry giants.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s Search Quality Guidelines emphasize the importance of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (EEAT) in ranking content. AI Overviews follow these same principles, favoring information from well-recognized publishers, government websites, and established industry leaders.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/google-eeat.webp\" alt=\"definition of google e-eat\" width=\"918\" height=\"580\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90007\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/google-eeat.webp 918w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/google-eeat-480x303.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Studies by Ahrefs have also shown that <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/impact-of-links\/\">websites with a strong backlink profile\u2014particularly those with links from reputable domains\u2014are far more likely to appear in AI-curated search results<\/a>. This means that without a strong foundation of credibility and authority, smaller businesses may struggle to compete.<\/p>\n<h4>How to establish authority and improve AI visibility<\/h4>\n<p>For businesses looking to improve their chances of being featured in AI Overviews, the key is to build credibility through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/better-content-performance\">strategic content efforts<\/a> and high-quality backlinks. Here\u2019s how to do it effectively:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Secure backlinks from trusted industry websites: <\/strong>AI places a heavy emphasis on authority, and backlinks from reputable sources act as endorsements of a site\u2019s credibility. Focus on earning links from well-respected industry blogs, major publications, and educational institutions by publishing valuable content that others want to reference.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Publish thought leadership content featuring expert insights: <\/strong>AI Overviews favor content written by recognized experts in their fields. Businesses can increase their perceived authority by producing in-depth articles, whitepapers, and research-backed reports featuring insights from industry professionals. Including author bios that highlight credentials can further strengthen credibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Collaborate with established industry leaders: <\/strong>Partnering with recognized experts through guest posts, interviews, and co-authored content can enhance a brand\u2019s authority. Being cited or featured in reputable sources also increases the likelihood that AI will consider a website trustworthy enough to pull information from.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regularly update content with fresh data and authoritative references: <\/strong>AI favors content that is both relevant and well-supported by reliable sources. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-repurposing\">Regularly updating blog posts<\/a>, case studies, and research articles with the latest statistics, reports, and citations from trusted organizations ensures that content remains competitive in AI-driven search results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"long-tail-and-niche-keywords-are-growing-in-importance\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Long-tail and niche keywords are growing in importance<\/h3>\n<p>AI Overviews are optimized for broad, high-volume search queries but often struggle to provide relevant answers for specific, nuanced searches. This presents an opportunity for businesses to target long-tail and niche keywords, capturing high-intent traffic that AI may overlook.<\/p>\n<p>Because AI-generated summaries pull generalized information from authoritative sources, they tend to offer one-size-fits-all responses. However, when users search for highly specific queries, such as industry-specific recommendations or in-depth comparisons, AI often fails to deliver personalized insights.<\/p>\n<p>Postman is a great example: The company is shown twice in AI Overviews and once in the feature snippet for the keyword \u201csoap api.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/soap-api-ai-overview-example.webp\" alt=\"postman blog showing twice in ai overview for soap api search\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/soap-api-ai-overview-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/soap-api-ai-overview-example-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>How to capitalize on AI\u2019s weaknesses<\/h4>\n<p>To compete effectively, businesses should focus on keywords that require depth, expertise, and niche-specific knowledge. Here\u2019s how to identify and optimize for these opportunities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use keyword tools to find AI-resistant queries: <\/strong>AI struggles with highly detailed, less frequently searched queries. Tools like AlsoAsked, AnswerThePublic, and Google\u2019s \u2018People Also Ask\u2019 can reveal questions AI may not answer well, giving businesses the chance to create content that fills those gaps.

Visual and video content is gaining ground<\/h3>\n<p>As AI Overviews evolve, they increasingly prioritize video and visual content over traditional text-based answers. This shift gives an advantage to businesses investing in multimedia, particularly video tutorials, product demonstrations, and visually engaging content.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/video-marketing-statistics\/\"><strong>91%<\/strong><\/a><strong> of businesses say video marketing has increased their traffic<\/strong>, according to Wyzowl\u2019s Video Marketing Report.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.godatafeed.com\/blog\/google-ai-overview-prefers-video\"><strong>Google\u2019s AI favors video-based tutorials<\/strong><\/a><strong> and product demos<\/strong> because they provide a more engaging and practical way to answer user queries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With AI Overviews now embedding video content directly in search results, businesses that leverage multimedia effectively can gain an edge over competitors relying solely on written content.<\/p>\n<h4>How to optimize for AI-driven video search<\/h4>\n<p>To increase visibility in AI-powered search, brands must ensure their video content is both high-quality and optimized for discovery. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create video content designed for search: <\/strong>Videos should target specific search queries, with keyword-rich titles, detailed descriptions, and timestamps that help Google understand their content. AI favors well-structured videos that clearly answer user intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-video-example.png\" alt=\"ai overview example with video result and format\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-video-example.png 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-video-example-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Embed videos in blog posts and landing pages: <\/strong>Businesses should integrate videos into existing web pages rather than rely on video content alone. Relevant tutorials or demonstrations can boost on-page engagement and improve rankings in AI-driven search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leverage YouTube SEO to drive traffic: <\/strong>Since Google prioritizes YouTube content in AI Overviews, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/youtube-seo\">optimizing for YouTube search is crucial<\/a>. This includes writing detailed descriptions, adding relevant tags, and using engaging thumbnails to improve click-through rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-to-future-proof-your-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h2>Strategies to future-proof your SEO approach<\/h2>\n<p>As AI Overviews continue to reshape search results, businesses must adapt their <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2025-local-seo-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO strategies<\/a> to stay competitive. The key is to create content that AI struggles to replicate, optimize for structured visibility, and build brand authority across multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<div id=\"develop-ai-resistant-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Develop &#8220;AI-resistant&#8221; content<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;The best way to make your content AI-resistant isn\u2019t to fight the algorithm. It\u2019s to be irreplaceable. That means leaning into your brand voice and using authentic storytelling. When your content has personality and a perspective that AI can\u2019t replicate, it naturally stands out. The content game is still about quality,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/oskarduberg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oskar Duberg<\/a>, a freelance content specialist.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;AI-generated content is elevator music. Bland, forgettable, and very easy to tune out. To really stand out, your content needs a pulse. A beat. That means authentic storytelling, a clear perspective, and insights that come from personal experience, not just data,\u201d Oskar said.<\/p>\n<p>AI is excellent at summarizing widely available information, but it struggles with content that requires original thought, deep storytelling, and expert analysis<strong>.<\/strong> To ensure your content remains valuable and difficult for AI to replace, focus on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Publishing proprietary research that AI cannot replicate: <\/strong>Conduct original studies, run surveys, and publish unique data that adds fresh insights to your industry. AI cannot generate or summarize data that does not already exist.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interviewing industry experts for firsthand insights: <\/strong>AI pulls from existing sources, but expert interviews introduce fresh perspectives and nuanced opinions that AI cannot fabricate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/industry-expert-healthcare-example.webp\" alt=\"healthcare expert interviewed for hospital blog on eldest daughter syndrome\" width=\"1086\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/industry-expert-healthcare-example.webp 1086w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/industry-expert-healthcare-example-980x812.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/industry-expert-healthcare-example-480x398.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1086px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating in-depth product comparisons that require subjective judgment<\/strong>: AI can summarize feature lists, but it struggles with subjective opinions, detailed comparisons, and personal recommendations that involve human decision-making.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Writing case studies with real-world applications: <\/strong>AI cannot replicate real customer experiences, success stories, or business challenges. Detailed case studies with tangible results make your content irreplaceable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By focusing on unique, high-value content that AI cannot easily summarize, businesses can safeguard their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-trends-and-predictions-rest-of-2025\">SEO performance<\/a> despite AI-driven changes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"optimize-for-snippet-worthy-formatting\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Optimize for &#8220;snippet-worthy&#8221; formatting<\/h3>\n<p>AI Overviews are drawn to well-structured content that&#8217;s easy to extract and display. If you want to increase your chances of showing up in AI-generated search results, optimizing for featured snippets and AI-friendly formatting is essential.<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie Yoder, Director of Content at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rebrandly.com\/\">Rebrandly<\/a>, puts it best: \u201cTo make your content AI-friendly, use clear headers (H2, H3) with relevant keywords. AI scans these headings to get a sense of your content, so optimized headers are key to boosting visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Bullet points and numbered lists are also crucial because AI prefers concise, scannable information, and lists make it easier for the algorithm to pull your key takeaways. Lastly, structuring your content in a Q&amp;A or FAQ format is a game-changer. AI loves pulling from Q&amp;A sections, so answering common industry questions increases your odds of getting featured in snippets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp\" alt=\"ai overview example with faq content structure\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/ai-overview-faq-content-example-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By following these best practices, you&#8217;re not just improving your AI visibility; you\u2019re also ensuring your content stands out in organic search.<\/p>\n<div id=\"strengthen-brand-authority\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Strengthen brand authority<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;With AI prioritizing trusted sources, building authority across multiple platforms is more critical than ever. Google\u2019s AI is more likely to reference brands that have a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-presence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strong digital presence<\/a> and recognized expertise,\u201d Stephanie said<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To establish authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Earn mentions in high-authority industry publications: <\/strong>AI Overviews rely on information from trusted sources. Getting featured in top-tier publications and respected industry blogs improves credibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Publish content on third-party platforms like LinkedIn and Medium: <\/strong>AI pulls from multiple sources, not just your website. Expanding your content distribution to high-authority platforms increases visibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Actively engage in digital PR and guest posting: <\/strong>AI favors well-known thought leaders. Writing guest posts, contributing to industry discussions, and securing media coverage strengthen brand recognition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/urgent-care-press-example.webp\" alt=\"this urgent care clinic was featured in the local news\" width=\"936\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/urgent-care-press-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/urgent-care-press-example-480x297.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like to think of AI Overviews as being cited as a source.
