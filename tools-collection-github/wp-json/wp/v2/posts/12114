Although mastering the entirety of agency sales takes practice and experience, understanding how to properly articulate the value you will bring to a potential client in a written proposal is something that can be templatized and adjusted to fit each new prospect\u2019s specific needs.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-business-proposals-writing.png\" alt=\"person writing a winning business proposal\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Having an organized format for writing proposals will help you get right to the point and effectively convey the value you are offering so that you can create proposals to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/16\/get-more-clients\">win new business<\/a> without reinventing the wheel. In this post, I will walk you through my step-by-step process for writing client proposals in order to give you a template for organizing your thoughts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a business proposal?<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A business proposal is a formal document that encapsulates the full scope of the project your prospective client needs done. It encapsulates the entire project so that the client can make an informed decision to choose you. Business proposals:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Make crystal clear the process, timeline, and price so you have clear expectations set.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Tie the components of the project back to the client&#8217;s goals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Show the value of the work you will be doing (i.e. that it&#8217;s worth the price).<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Give you the opportunity to demonstrate the very same thoroughness and personalization the client can expect to see throughout the project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business proposals keep you on track while also giving the client visibility into the project.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Essential information you need to\u00a0write your business proposal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Regardless of how the prospect found you, you should have an introductory phone call <\/strong>to better acquaint yourself with them and understand what they are looking to achieve from paid advertising prior to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/07\/proposal-generator\">drafting the\u00a0proposal<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You need to gather\u00a0all of the information available to you\u00a0so you can make accurate estimates, identify the context for presenting the scope of work, and be sure that you address the challenges, goals, and desired results of the project.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here is a list of what kinds of information you should gather from an introductory phone call or meeting:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Overall goal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This may seem like common sense, but there are tons of folks out there who want to run paid marketing programs without a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/02\/ppc-guide-for-beginners-2\">clearly defined goal<\/a>. I try to ask this question in a number of ways in order to really get to what the prospect is looking for. Having a clear understanding between you and the prospect about what they want will help you manage expectations as well as define goals and benchmarks with them down the road. This can also help you disqualify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/02\/customer-health-scoring\">potentially risky clients<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Potential budget<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is a massive factor for anyone in the agency space, as a client\u2019s ability to spend money on ads also dictates their ability to pay you. You will want to understand how much they are willing to spend on ads and whether that figure is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/05\/maximize-agency-profitability\">scalable over time<\/a>. Some agencies have fixed pricing models, whereas many independent contractors will be flexible in their pricing. Either way, this is an opportunity to gauge the prospect\u2019s long-term potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Industry<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When I conduct introductory phone calls with prospects, I take into consideration what type of industry they are operating within. This plays a huge factor in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/05\/best-ad-platform\">which channels I will decide<\/a> to build my strategy on as well as the level of difficulty the audience will be to market to. Some prospects may want to spend thousands of dollars per month, but if the niche they\u2019re attempting to advertise to has limited or ambiguous search queries or characteristics that aren\u2019t easily identifiable within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/22\/combine-ppc-with-social-media\">paid social<\/a>, then the project is going to be much more difficult and have a lower probability of success. This should also pertain to the prospect\u2019s offer\u2014what they plan to promote via paid channels. If the offer has a complicated conversion path or high level of friction, this may cause issues down the road for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-winning-business-proposals-data-dashboard.png\" alt=\"data dashboard used to gain industry insights for business proposal\" width=\"800\" height=\"427\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Marketing operations support<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Personally, I like to gather insight into the sophistication of their marketing operations. This includes everything from web development, automation, lead scoring, and inevitably how many members they have on the team. Having an efficient system that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/21\/facebook-funnel\">nurtures and funnels leads<\/a> appropriately is important to me when determining the scalability and general \u201chealth\u201d of a prospect. What I mean by \u201chealth\u201d is whether systems are put in place that allow me to succeed with them. Many of these can be put together over time, but I typically want some type of structure to be in place before I get started. Additional details in this regard are design and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/effective-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> support, as well as access to analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Sales support<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For many B2B prospects, the product or service that they offer inevitably has to be sold by an account representative or someone internally via a phone call or meeting. Understanding the prospect\u2019s sales cycle, sales funnel, and whether they have business development or sales associates is very important in regards to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">prospect quality.<\/a> A strong sales team is your best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to write a business proposal that will win over your prospect<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve gathered all the information you need for a prospect, you\u2019re ready to start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/19\/using-proposals-as-a-sales-tool\">drafting your proposal<\/a>. Here are the six steps to producing a proposal that wins over your prospects.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #1: Set the main objectives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To start my proposals, I begin with a section that outlines the primary objectives that the prospect and myself are looking to achieve. I will typically include three overarching objectives for this section with short and long-term cadences. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/winning20business20proposal20objectives.png\" alt=\"winning business proposal example of objectives\" width=\"800\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This section acts as somewhat of a summary of my strategy that will be included in more detail in the subsequent parts of the proposal. These objectives are the end result of my determination on what the general strategy will be and how the clients goals will be achieved. I will include short and long-term objectives in this section as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/25\/adwords-experts-4\">success over time <\/a>will provide more opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #2: Outline the project scope and key tasks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this section, I break down the details of my strategy into their respective parts. There are several steps to getting a prospect started with paid advertising that need to be addressed early on. These include: account\/channel access, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">account build-out and structure<\/a>, tracking for conversions, as well as tracking for the purpose of creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/17\/remarketing-audiences\">remarketing audiences<\/a>. Outside of these tasks, I will include more information on what we plan to do after the initial setup. This will include targeting strategies, promotional strategies, and the baseline costs. I will go into detail about how I plan to pace the proposed budget number and what that will entail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In some cases, additional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a> or other documents may be linked within here to give more transparency on the details of the strategy. I also make it clear how performance will be reported and the cadence of check-in meetings. Overall, the structure of this section appears similar to this:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-winning-business-proposal-scope-example.png\" alt=\"example of scope section of a winning business proposal\" width=\"800\" height=\"956\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #3: List the requirements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The third section that I separate from the project scope and tasks is what I call the \u201crequirements\u201d section. This page includes all of the access and additional reports or support (design, etc.) that I will need from the client. This makes it clear what the client has to do in order for us to begin working together. This section is important because being straightforward about what you will need access to and why will prevent many future headaches you may face.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-winning-business-proposal-requirements-section.png\" alt=\"requirements section of a business proposal example\" width=\"720\" height=\"670\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I generally include three major requirements in this section:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Access to the ad accounts<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Access to Google Analytics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Access to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/12\/google-tag-manager\">Google Tag Manager<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This ensures that I have the tools I need in order to set up conversion tracking and place any pixels necessary. With Google Analytics access, this allows me to create goals related directly to the channel-specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/31\/increase-conversions\">conversions<\/a> and, therefore, have an additional layer data and truth in my reporting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #4: Define the timeline<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In some instances, I will include a section that outlines the timeline of events in order to launch proposed campaigns. This, again, allows the client to understand what needs to be done on both of our ends in order to get everything kicked off. Many prospects that you will connect with are very eager and (sometimes impatient) to get started. This section makes it clear what needs to be done, when it will be done, and when everything will be launched. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/winning20business20proposal20task20due20date.png\" alt=\"task and due date chart in a business proposal example\" width=\"800\" height=\"261\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #5: Discuss the pricing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This section is dedicated solely to how the client will be charged, including an explanation of your rate and when you send invoices. It\u2019s important to place this section towards the end of your proposal because you want to show the prospect all of the value you have to offer them prior to the quote, thus justifying the cost of your services. You provide more detail by adding multiple layers of services and what they cost respectively. In my experience, the more transparent the better. I typically organize this section as a table:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/winning20business20proposal20stage20and20retainer.png\" alt=\"stage and retainer portion of a business proposal example\" width=\"800\" height=\"210\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #6: Follow up<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After you complete your proposal and send it over to the prospective client, it\u2019s critical to have a plan to follow up with the individual or team. I suggest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/08\/client-meetings\">setting up a call or meeting<\/a>\u00a0to go over the proposal with them and answer any questions they may have about it. Sending them the proposal in written form and then going over it with them in person is much better than doing one or the other in my opinion. My reasoning for this is that it allows the prospect to read your proposal and digest the information on their own. With time in between the proposal being sent and your follow-up call, they have time to think about what they have read. Once you have the call with them and review it together, you can alleviate any apprehensions they may have or explain things a little better for them.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/winning20business20proposal20signature.png\" alt=\"signature portion of a business proposal example\" width=\"800\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This may seem contrary to some sales beliefs about limiting time. Many would advise you to present the proposal in person all at once. I\u2019m against this strategy for the primary reason that these proposals typically have a great deal of information in them. I want the prospect to know exactly what they\u2019re getting into and what the engagement will entail. Putting pressure on a prospect to make a decision on a phone call or in a meeting doesn\u2019t benefit either party in the long run. I want the proposal to sell itself and then offer to provide any clarity afterward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Final tips for writing a great business proposal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Last but not least, I have two important suggestions for presenting the best proposal:<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Keep your account audit separate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In some instances, once you complete the pre-proposal information,\u00a0may get access to pre-existing accounts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/06\/ppc-account-audit\">to audit them<\/a>. I would suggest keeping your account audit and proposal separate from each other. Having them together may result in information overload for the prospect. Have your audit separate with concise notes, takeaways, and solutions. Use the primary courses of action from the audit and integrate it within your proposal. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-business-proposal-audit-notes.png\" alt=\"audit notes portion of a business proposal example\" width=\"720\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Keep your contract separate too<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One clear distinction I want to make is that in my process, I do not\u00a0draft the\u00a0proposal and contract together. The proposal\u00a0should act as an extension of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">sales process<\/a>. It&#8217;s a statement of work in addition to an outline of strategy and how you are planning to achieve the client\u2019s objectives. The contract comes after the proposal is accepted and pertains to the legal details regarding compensation, non-competition, and other details agreed upon in the proposal. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You are now equipped to write winning business proposals<\/h2>\n<p>With the steps and tips I&#8217;ve provided in this post, you now have what it takes to write business proposals that turn prospective clients into paying clients. There was a lot to cover, so let&#8217;s finish off with a recap:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before writing the proposal, gather\u00a0your information:<\/strong>\u00a0The prospect&#8217;s key objectives, goals, challenges, budget, industry, resources, and more.
