The commitment &amp; consistency bias<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/tactics.convertize.com\/definitions\/commitment-and-consistency\">commitment and consistency bias<\/a> says that we have the tendency to act in line with our previous behaviors and expressions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-commitment-and-consistenc-bias.png\" alt=\"marketing psychology - commitment and consistency bias\" width=\"477\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61419\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon has a few manifestations that can work to your advantage in marketing.<\/p>\n<h4>Create a lead nurture funnel<\/h4>\n<p>Once we heed a small request, we are more likely to comply with similar ones that follow. This is the concept behind the marketing funnel! At the top of the funnel are small requests for your audience, which gradually get bigger as the prospect moves <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">downward to the bottom<\/a>.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel-commitment.png\" alt=\"marketing funnel commitment levels\" width=\"720\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel-commitment.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel-commitment-480x342.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nFor example, you ask readers to read your content, then you ask them to give their email in exchange for a free guide, then you ask them to attend an event or webinar, and then you invite them to a free trial or consult.<\/p>\n<p>Since your audience is subconsciously inclined to keep their behaviors consistent, they are more likely to continue pursuing and engaging with the content and offers from the business they first started with. Plus, compared to their first action (reading a blog post), a free trial is a big jump, but compared to the previous action (attending a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/03\/marketing-webinars\">webinar<\/a>), it\u2019s not as drastic.<\/p>\n<h4>Have progress markers for tasks<\/h4>\n<p>Another form of the commitment bias is the sunk cost fallacy\u2014the need to follow through with something once we\u2019ve invested time and\/or money into it. For example, Yelp lets you draft <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a> without creating an account. When you begin writing, Yelp uses fun cues like \u201cDon&#8217;t leave us hanging &#8211; what else you got?\u201d to encourage you to complete the review.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-yelp-3-1.png\" alt=\"how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions\u2014yelp review process\" width=\"800\" height=\"548\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then, once you finish the review, they ask you to create an account\u2014without which you can\u2019t post your review.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-yelp-2-1.png\" alt=\"how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions\u2014yelp encouraging signup to publish review\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now you don&#8217;t <em>have<\/em> to create an account and post the review, but more likely than not, you\u2019ve put in the effort to write it, so you want to make the time you spent worth it. You\u2019re not going to abandon the process now, are you?<\/p>\n<h4>Break your content up into digestible tidbits<\/h4>\n<p>You can also leverage the commitment and consistency bias to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/commitment-consistency-ux\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase engagement with your content<\/a>\u2014particularly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content <\/a>over 5,000 words.

Instead of asking readers to commit to reading the whole piece, it start with the bite and the snack upfront. The bite is the overall verdict. The snack is a visual of the pros and cons of the product. And then the meal is the detailed review.<\/p>\n<p>If the reader has engaged with the smaller, more digestible pieces of information at the beginning, they will be more likely to perform the larger request: to read the full piece. Should they choose not to read it, they can at least get the key takeaways at the top and obtain value from the content.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-bite-snack-meal.png\" alt=\"marketing psychology - bite snack meal approach\" width=\"431\" height=\"667\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59696\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Speak to your audience&#8217;s self-perception<\/h4>\n<p>I highly doubt this was done intentionally, but the call to action button below is a great example of the C&amp;C bias in copywriting.

The paradox of choice<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re at the supermarket and you want to buy some tea. As you approach the aisle, the rainbow of packaging looks great. But as you start browsing, you start feeling not-so-great. There&#8217;s black tea. Green tea. White. Red. Regular tea, decaf, or herbal. Fruit tea. Zingers. Loose leaf. Probiotic. Sleep-enhancing. Memory boosting. And that&#8217;s just for one brand. Overwhelmed, you abort the mission altogether.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the paradox of choice!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice.png\" alt=\"marketing psychology - the paradox of choice\" width=\"600\" height=\"665\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice-480x532.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The paradox of choice says that as the number of options to choose from increases, the more stressed we feel about making a decision and the more likely we are to not make one at all. We also are more likely to have doubts about whether the decision we made was the right one. Here are some ways to remove analysis paralysis for your audience.<\/p>\n<h4>Keep varieties and options to a minimum<\/h4>\n<p>In an experiment by Sheena Iyengar, when a supermarket made six types of jam available for tasing, it attracted 40% of shoppers, 30% of whom bought jam. But when this was repeated with 24 types of jam, it attracted 60% of shoppers and resulted in only 3% of purchases. If you want to increase your conversion rates, consider decreasing the options available to your audience. Perhaps offer a sale on a select number of products, or reduce your five pricing packages down to three.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam.png\" alt=\"psychology in marketing - paradox of choice\" width=\"720\" height=\"446\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam-480x297.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<article><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yourmarketingrules.com\/the-paradox-of-choice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/article>\n<h4>Limit the number of items in your main navigation menu<\/h4>\n<p>While a big part of marketing is to go against the norm so you can stand out, there are still many areas where this could work against you. For example, you might see that a competitor has just five items in their website&#8217;s navigation bar. So maybe you think to have 10 in yours so prospects can see that you have more to offer. The truth is, websites should only have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/blog\/fixing-website-navigation-bar\/#:~:text=A%20good%20rule%20of%20thumb,likely%20to%20leave%20your%20website.\">3-6 items in their navigation bar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Too many options to choose from, and the visitor becomes confused on what to do or where to go.

Even though it&#8217;s &#8220;your job&#8221; to serve them and their job to pay you, the extra effort you make to meet their needs inspires the extra effort they&#8217;ll make to write you a review\u2014or even through a little something extra in their cart or to their order.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community.png\" alt=\"most popular social media platforms - linkedin post example\" width=\"400\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54135\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community-182x300.png 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Provide free (valuable) information and education<\/h4>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing<\/a> and SEO in a nutshell.

Display ads give your business exposure. Mere exposure!<br \/>\nThe more exposure to your business, the more familiar your audience becomes with it, and the more familiar it becomes with it, the more they will trust, engage with, and prefer it over competitors. Combine this with the commitment and consistency effect you\u2019ve got yourself some loyal customers.<br \/>\nThis is why brand awareness is so important. Indeed, display ads can improve click-through and conversion rates on all your other ads and campaigns. Hence the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/14\/view-through-conversions\">view-through conversion metric<\/a>.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"ad types for each stage of the marketing funnel\" width=\"600\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61426 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-funnel-480x385.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Use retargeting ads to increase CTR<\/h4>\n<p>But click-through rates aren&#8217;t low for all display ads.

An appropriate <a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/record\/1990-00422-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">delay between exposures<\/a> gives them time to settle in so the repetitions are more effective.<\/p>\n<h4>Send the same message across all channels<\/h4>\n<p>You can also repeat your messaging and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">unique value proposition<\/a> (USP) across your brand assets, including your website, blog posts, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletters<\/a>, ads, and other touchpoints.

You can share the same content more than once\u2014just make sure you allow enough time in between postings.<\/p>\n<h4>Have a brand style<\/h4>\n<p>While brand awareness measures how many people know about your brand, brand recognition measures how quickly a person can associate a piece of content they see or hear with your brand.<br \/>\nTo build brand recognition, you should have an appealing, eye-catching logo as well as a brand style guide.

Similarly, setting high standards for your employees with enthusiasm can have the same effect.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect.png\" alt=\"marketing psychology - the pgymalion effect\" width=\"573\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59677\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect.png 573w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect-480x398.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 573px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Unify your team and improve the customer experience<\/h4>\n<p>This is why identifying the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/11\/core-values\">core values<\/a> for your brand\u2014and keeping those top-of-mind with your team\u2014is so important. This gives individuals a clear set of expectations and qualities to strive for and incorporate into everything they do. The more positive feedback they receive, the more and more they will truly exemplify those values. This not only makes for a unified team, but also makes for a consistent and extraordinary customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, expectations can shape reality.<\/p>\n<h4>Create a positive feedback loop with your customers<\/h4>\n<p>You can also apply this tactic directly to your audience. By conveying that a higher level of performance is attainable, a better version of themselves is on the horizon, or that they can become the best in their field, you encourage them to act in a way that aligns with those beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>These actions might start out by downloading your content or<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\"> following you on social media<\/a>. The more confidence they have that they can achieve their goal with your help, and that they\u2019re already on the way to doing it, the more likely they are to be a customer. Even better, as they achieve their goals over time, they can become <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Hold your team to high standards and show your customers that they are capable of achieving their goals, and success will flow from there.<\/p>\n<h2>Psychology and marketing: use them together!<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, psychology and marketing go hand-in-hand naturally, but there are ways to use psychology intentionally to improve your marketing results. Just remember, focus on building great products and earning the trust of your audience through responsible marketing strategies. It\u2019s a combination proven to work better in the long term.<\/p>\n<p>To recap, here are the marketing psychology strategies to influence buyer decisions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a
