Apparel<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8ebbf11-eada-4935-9981-261046f34951\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-apparel.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Apparel\" width=\"803\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>With limited traditional retail options available, this season\u2019s fashion is exclusively online. We have seen CTRs and CVRs rise as CPCs fall below their normal levels since the early days of the pandemic. Performance first spiked in April and is\u00a0still carrying that momentum into May.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Beauty &amp; Personal Care<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f6f2953-68d9-4154-b7d0-9dab573a136e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-beauty-personal.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Beauty &amp; Personal\" width=\"802\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In quarantine, the truth has become clear: We don\u2019t all just wake up like this. With barbers, salons, and beauticians closed across the county, many of us had to take our personal care into our own hands and in April we saw conversion rates spike for beauty and grooming products. In May, as these local services began to open their doors, behaviors shifted again. Many shopping campaigns saw lower conversion rates and higher CPAs, but those were largely offset by a surge in online bookings for the hair and nail services we\u2019ve all missed.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Hobbies &amp; Leisure<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c3f1b160-0079-4b93-846f-be2fc48c1b5f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-hobbies-leisure.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Hobbies &amp; Leisure\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Puzzle, games, knitting, and paint\u2014as we all spent our months indoors at home, we\u2019ve had the unexpected opportunity to reinvest in our hobbies with our free time. This extra free time was a nice windfall for these advertisers who saw pretty stable performance throughout the past few months.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Arts &amp; Entertainment<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9cf5fb36-e28d-4bc0-b20f-2f8e56240914\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-arts-entertainment.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Arts &amp; Entertainment\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Live entertainment and cultural attractions felt the brunt of the lockdown almost immediately, and these advertisers saw challenges early in April. Luckily, as these attractions reopen, their ads are quick to rebound to the attention of stir-crazy searchers.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Computers &amp; Electronics<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"90ef2e93-3ac7-4d7d-ae72-993668be96f5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-computers-electronics.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Computers &amp; Electronics\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As economic stimulus checks rolled out to consumers throughout April and May, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klaviyo.com\/blog\/stimulus-spending-patterns-coronavirus\">spending on big-ticket electronics quickly rose as well<\/a>. The SERP met the demands of this extra search interest without much noticeable change in CPC or CPA. Technology advertisers on Bing continued to reap the benefits of their unique audience and saw considerably better performance than on Google Ads.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Occasions &amp; Gifts<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1019689d-95e7-492f-84bb-5cd664db6bea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-occasions.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Occasions &amp; Gifts\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Lockdown or not\u2014birthdays, anniversaries, Easter, Mother\u2019s Day, and graduations still all happened over the past few months. This year\u2019s celebrations were different, but the sentiment still rings the same. Online advertisers saw lower costs but were still able to convert their customers. Subscription boxes and delivered gift box sales soared in place of traditionally bought gifts.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Health<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba6cb9e2-b15e-4a69-a2cb-ff1c4529c596\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-health.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Health\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>People are focusing on health more than ever, particularly as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/30\/covid-19-google-search-trends\">coronavirus became the most popular search query on Google in April<\/a>. With higher search volume and lower CPCs on Google, health and medical advertisers were able to find plenty of new customers and convert them inexpensively.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Real Estate<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"507e4593-c98e-452b-bdf5-e0473817a79b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-real-estate.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Real Estate\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Real estate had to overcome the challenge of stopping showings and open houses during the pandemic but rose to the occasion to sell more online. Appointments are nearly a must for buyers these days, and real estate agents have become more trusted advisors and concierges to home buyers. The recently reduced CPCs have helped real estate advertisers keep costs low while they connect buyers and sellers online.<\/p>\n<h2>10 industries with mixed PPC performance during COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>Some industries are reacting to new challenges and shifts on the SERP and have the potential to either sink or swim in the current state.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Retail<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"de9dca79-81fa-458a-8fd7-0126a5280572\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-retail.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Retail\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>We have seen shopping traffic increase by 40% throughout April, which offers plenty of opportunity for retailers. However, online shoppers can be notoriously fickle and hard to convert. When your competitors&#8217; products are only a few clicks away, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">write compelling product descriptions<\/a> and think of how to convert your customers off the SERP with remarketing and social ads.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Food &amp; Groceries<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cc1a7059-201e-4c0a-a8eb-9b404af9b8d9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-food-groceries.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Food &amp; Groceries\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s true that food and grocery spending is nearly at an all-time high, but online advertisers have a new challenge to deal with this surge of traffic. As online grocery delivery grows from a luxury to a near necessity for many looking to avoid a crowded grocery, many of these new searchers are more skeptical to give up their old habits and are researching other alternatives. Compounded with increasing CPCs and large services like Instacart upping their advertising budget, many online groceries aren\u2019t getting the bumper results they\u2019d expect.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Dining &amp; Nightlife<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dbc45138-36f5-471b-9f99-7bfe5dc6c19a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-dining-nightlife.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Dining &amp; Nightlife\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Conversely, restaurant spending is at an all-time low with dine-in options eliminated throughout most of the country. Take-out may be an option for some restaurants, but with many places closed or with limited hours or menu, more people are turning to search for their local eateries. Restaurants who have advertised throughout this period are seeing good CTRs and low CPCs and CPAs. Restaurants can also benefit from extended free trials and waved order fees from popular platforms like Toast and Square through <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.withgoogle.com\/offers#!\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google for Small Business\u2019s partner program.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Home &amp; Garden<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c790e7be-e331-4ae2-af26-9c38ebcf5480\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-home-garden.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Home &amp; Garden\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Many home and garden advertisers saw an uptick in conversions and conversion rate in April as the pandemic kept people home and jumpstarted their home improvement projects and their PPC ads saw a nice increase in conversion rate at a cheaper CPC and CPA. But as stay-at-home orders are lifted, that performance uptick is beginning to disappear. It\u2019s uncertain if this better performance will be temporary or continue in the coming months.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Sports &amp; Fitness<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dc2fcb85-ae66-440a-ae8f-7781e646addb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-sports-fitness.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Sports &amp; Fitness\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sports and fitness advertising looks a lot different without organized sports or gyms. In late March and April, as advertisers pulled budget, CPCs fell rapidly alongside search conversion rates. As governments begin to lay out their plans for the future of gyms, studios, and sports, optimism is growing and ad CTRs and conversion rates are back on the rise.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Vehicles<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c7259a4d-ff37-42f6-b184-28ff38626e48\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-vehicles.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Vehicles\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The auto industry was riddled with supply line and import issues since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The added economic decline and reduced mobility hurt demand as well. Still, there is need and demand on the SERP and with closed showrooms, online vehicle searches have risen. Advertisers have noticed a healthy increase to their CTR with lower CPCs as large OEMs cut their ad budget. Search preferences are changing today, with more searchers beginning to consider preowned cars over new models<\/p>\n<h3>7. Legal &amp; Government<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7150b2cd-6c05-46d4-bef1-6e5c073672ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-legal.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Legal &amp; Government\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Legal PPC advertising remains mostly stable during COVID-19, albeit one of the most expensive verticals. Some practices are shifting focus as there have been fewer person injury and criminal cases with many safe at home, but there\u2019s been an increased demand for more general counsel and civil cases, such as divorce, wills, and business contingencies drawn.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Business &amp; Industrial<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"12d74e62-9ff0-462d-9d53-4f945a51bf7b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-benchmarks-covid-19-updated-business-industrial.png\" alt=\"updated Google Ads benchmarks during COVID-19 for Business &amp; Industrial\" width=\"803\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From the surface, B2B advertisers are seeing some healthy results\u2014a growth in CTR, and modest declines in CPC and CPA. Under that optimism, there\u2019s still some reluctance for advertisers to increase budgets without knowing what tomorrow will hold. Many businesses are also more scrutinous of taking on a new partner or vendor as well and conversion rates are falling slightly as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/08\/attribution-models\">prospects may take longer to purchase and need to interact with your brand more before deciding to convert.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>9.

Conversion rates have fallen nearly 30% since March, and that trend doesn\u2019t seem to be letting up. Many larger advertisers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/20\/when-to-ramp-up-ad-spend-during-covid-19\">ramping up their marketing budgets<\/a> now, which is beginning to drive CPCs up for smaller advertisers.<\/p>\n<h3>2.

On the SERP, performance KPIs don\u2019t seem too bad, but that\u2019s largely due to very conservative campaign targets and budgets. It\u2019ll be interesting to watch how marketers react as restrictions are lifted and the industry slowly ramps back up.<\/p>\n<h2>What do these benchmarks mean?<\/h2>\n<p>These benchmarks can help you see how you\u2019re performing compared to your competitors, especially over time.

Smart advertisers can react to these shifting norms and adjust their PPC accounts to stay agile.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overall, CTRs are up nearly universally across Google and Bing.<\/strong> That\u2019s likely because advertisers have been able to quickly adjust their PPC ads and campaigns to provide a more relevant ad that speaks to searcher\u2019s needs in the pandemic, whereas you can\u2019t as readily shift your SEO listings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Although CVR is falling in many industries, CPC is mostly falling hand-in-hand at the same time.<\/strong> This could be largely attributed to Google\u2019s (and Bing\u2019s) Smart Bidding doing its job and adjusting advertiser\u2019s bids in real-time as it sees the performance of their ads rapidly shift across segments. This has helped keep many advertiser\u2019s ROIs stable or even growing, despite having a lower budget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So stay safe and practice social distancing. While you\u2019re stuck inside, keep an eye on your PPC accounts and the WordStream blog. We\u2019ll be posting regularly with new data and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/25\/covid-19-facebook-advertising\">strategies<\/a> to best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/02\/marketing-during-covid-19\">adjust your campaigns and copy<\/a> in these rapidly changing times.
