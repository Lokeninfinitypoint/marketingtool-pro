As far as I\u2019m concerned, this will be a MUST DO for all e-commerce websites that are advertising with Google.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve recently had the opportunity to try out the new dynamic remarketing ads, and in this post, I\u2019ll explain how they work, why they\u2019re better than traditional remarketing, and why you should care.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Remarketing: The Old Way<\/h2>\n<p>For any e-commerce website, it is becoming more and more important to have a Google Merchant Account set up. Merchant accounts are becoming extremely valuable within Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords), as they feed your PLAs (Product Listing Ads, soon to be replaced with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/14\/google-shopping-ads\">Google Shopping Campaigns<\/a>), <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/22\/adwords-product-extensions-guide\">Product Extensions<\/a>, and now your remarketing efforts. As most of you know, remarketing is important because not all potential customers that come to your site purchase right away. You need to continue to influence them not only through Google search and from your website, but also across Google\u2019s display network, as people spend <strong>95% of their time<\/strong> away from Google.<\/p>\n<p>Most people I\u2019ve worked with have <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/19\/google-adwords-remarketing-cheatsheet\">remarketing set up<\/a>, but it is generally too simplistic, in that it catches \u2018All Visitors\u2019 to their website, and serves them one generic message. Those that I\u2019ve spoken with that are ahead of the curve, are segmenting visitors to their site, and remarketing to those that have \u2018Abandoned the Shopping Cart\u2019 or \u2018Visited A Product Page.\u2019 If you\u2019ve gotten this far, <strong>bravo, you are doing a much better job than most of your competitors<\/strong>. However, this strategy has always been a HUGE undertaking. What if you have 50,000 products? Are you going to create 50,000 audience segments, and 50,000 unique image ads?<\/p>\n<h2>How Dynamic Remarketing Is Different<\/h2>\n<p>I know the biggest pain point in my remarketing efforts has always been getting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/12\/creating-adwords-image-ads\">image ads<\/a> generated for all of the products for sale. With Google\u2019s new Dynamic Remarketing feature (still in beta), <strong>Google will dynamically create ads for you that include your price, image, and text of your choice, all based on the behavior of your website visitors<\/strong>. Pretty sick, huh? No more dealing with creative, and more importantly, you can reach your customers with laser-focused messaging based on the products or content they were interested in when they visited your site.<\/p>\n<p>If you were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shoeme.ca\/\">ShoeMe.Ca<\/a>, an e-commerce shoe site, and your potential customer looked at a specific pair of Converse sneakers, wouldn\u2019t it be best to serve an ad with the image and price of the Men\u2019s White Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars he was viewing, and throw in a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/21\/google-adwords-offer-extensions\">free shipping offer<\/a> to entice him to come back? Or maybe cross-sell him with a pair of High Tops in case they are going for the Lil Wayne look? It\u2019s all going to be possible through Google real soon, and you will see solid gains in performance for your e-commerce website.<\/p>\n<h2>How Dynamic Remarketing Works<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n<p>You will be required to set up a customized Remarketing Tag on your site that will pull down Product Identification numbers from your merchant feed and pass them on to Google. Google will then match these Product IDs to your Google Merchant Center feed and use those characteristics to power your \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/23\/set-up-dynamic-remarketing-ads\">Dynamic Display Ads<\/a>.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>To get you started, there is some remarketing tagging you&#8217;ll place on your site. The implementation does take some coding knowledge, but if you are running an e-commerce website, you likely have a developer who is more than qualified to work with the JavaScript requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Once the coding is implemented properly, you\u2019ll need to get things set up in Google Ads. Just like any remarketing campaign, you\u2019ll need to set up some audiences to target. To do this, navigate to your Shared Library, Audiences, and then select \u2018Remarketing list\u2019 from the \u2018New audience\u2019 dropdown as seen below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dynamic-remarketing-audiences-1.png\" alt=\"Dynamic Remarketing Audience\" width=\"624\" height=\"235\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From there, create a \u2018List Definition,\u2019 meaning select who you want to contain in the audience. In the example below, I\u2019ve selected \u2018pagetype equals product.\u2019 This means I\u2019ll be cookie-ing those that have visited any page on my site that contains \u2018product\u2019 in the URL string. I\u2019ve then chosen a \u2018Membership duration\u2019 of 15 days. This basically means the number of days a visitor\u2019s cookie will stay on my remarketing list.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-dynamic-remarketing-list-1.png\" alt=\"Google Dynamic Remarketing List\" width=\"498\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can then assign the audiences to the ad groups you think will work best.<\/p>\n<p>Within ShoeMe\u2019s account, you&#8217;ll see four ad groups:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Product Viewers<\/strong>: Matches dynamically generated ads based on specific <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product pages<\/a> visited by the user.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shopping Cart Abandoners<\/strong>: Dynamically generates ads based on product pages visited by users who added items to their cart, but did not make a purchase, reducing money lost to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">shopping cart abandonment<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Buyers 3-60 Days<\/strong>: Targets users who made a purchase in the last 2 months for the purpose of strategically upselling related products.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Non-Product Viewers<\/strong>: Targets users who have been to a page on the site other than a product page, and generates ads based on the content of the pages that the user has been to.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I would encourage you to <strong>bid more aggressively for Shopping Cart Abandoners and for Product Viewers<\/strong> (who are further down the buying cycle). I tiered the bidding below with highest bid for Shopping Cart Abandoners, and lowest bid for Non Product Viewers (visited homepage, blog, etc.)<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dynamic-remarketing-campaign-1.png\" alt=\"Dynamic Remarketing Campaign\" width=\"625\" height=\"471\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Creating Your Dynamic Remarketing Ads<\/h2>\n<p>After assigning the appropriate audiences to each ad group, you\u2019ll need to set up your ads. <strong>This is the cool part.<\/strong> The \u2018Display ad builder\u2019 will soon have a dynamic ad option as seen below, with each banner size offering over 15 dynamic ads formats to choose from.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dynamic-remarketing-ad-builder-1.png\" alt=\"Dynamic Remarketing Ad Preview\" width=\"625\" height=\"230\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the ad seen here, your potential customer would have likely viewed these products, and is now being served the same product again, or a different style. They can then click on that specific product within the ad and be will be directed to that specific product page. <strong>How\u2019s that for qualifying your clicks?<\/strong> The ads will also rotate products, and generally be much more dynamic than static image ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dynamic-remarketing-ad-example-1.png\" alt=\"AdWords Dynamic Remarketing\" width=\"624\" height=\"88\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Why Dynamic Remarketing Is So Awesome<\/h2>\n<p>There are companies out there that offer similar remarketing options, but now <strong>you can do it all yourself within Google Ads\u00a0<\/strong>without any additional fee on top of your clicks. You\u2019ll have much better control on your remarketing efforts, and I\u2019m suspecting huge returns. ShoeMe.ca knows that <strong>50%<\/strong> <strong>of its business comes from returning visitors<\/strong>. Of these returning visitors, the average order value is <strong>$6<\/strong> <strong>higher than new visitors<\/strong>, and the average conversion rate is <strong>30%<\/strong> <strong>higher<\/strong>! Reengagement is a <strong>data-proven<\/strong> key to their business, and the dynamic remarketing is reengagement on steroids.<\/p>\n<p>Dynamic remarketing will be a key factor to any e-commerce website\u2019s future success, and if you don\u2019t get in the game, you will fall behind.<\/p>\n<p>Get the step-by-step guide to setting up <a
