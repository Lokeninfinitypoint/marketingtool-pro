As the user base expands, there are more opportunities for industry niches, rising star influencers, and must-follow business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>But that also means more engaging content competes for attention from users and LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm. Of course, you\u2019ll need to be on top of things like content quality and publishing frequency.

So, posting at the right times means a better chance your content gets in front of more people.<\/p>\n<p>When you sign into your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/linkedin-company-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn page<\/a>, your feed is automatically sorted by \u201ctop\u201d posts, as opposed to a chronological order of the most recent.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn users <em>can<\/em> switch manually to the most recent if they choose to do that. But they\u2019d have to do it every single time they log in. That\u2019s because the platform wants to serve the posts identified as \u201ctop\u201d by the algorithm first. Since most people won\u2019t go through that trouble, \u201ctop\u201d posts are seen the most.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my view, as an example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-png.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on LinkedIn - screenshot from LinkedIn account.\" width=\"774\" height=\"880\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90013 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-png.webp 774w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-480x546.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The top post is liked by Allen Finn, a marketer who previously wrote for the WordStream blog and regularly posts on LinkedIn (also relevant here is the fact that I\u2019m married to him).<\/p>\n<p>The actual content is shared by Emily Kramer, who runs the educational newsletter and advising program for marketers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mkt1.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MKT1<\/a>. She also has nearly 35,000 followers on LinkedIn, where she regularly shares this type of deep-diving, insightful content.<\/p>\n<p>My experience with LinkedIn here tells us a lot about how the algorithm works. For example, the LinkedIn algorithm prioritizes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accounts that you regularly interact with or are closely connected with: <\/strong>This includes accounts you engage with and follow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Accounts that other profiles comparable to yours interact with: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/linkedin-profile-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Profiles<\/a> comparable to yours may have the same industry experience, similar companies, close job titles, or even matching keywords in your bios.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Posts with high engagement, especially in the form of substantive comments: <\/strong>The key word here is substantive. Those posts asking for a single emoji \u201cvote\u201d? LinkedIn is ruling these out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Posts with high-quality content: <\/strong>This means no spam or spam-like text or images, no clickbait with a million lines of only one or two words to entice a \u201csee more\u201d click.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering what spam is, here\u2019s how LinkedIn detects it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-png.webp\" alt=\"Best time to post on LinkedIn - LinkedIn's process chart for detecting spam.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90015 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-980x569.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>According to <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/blog\/engineering\/trust-and-safety\/viral-spam-content-detection-at-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>LinkedIn<\/em><\/a><em>, this is the model for spam detection.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So what does this have to do with the timing of your LinkedIn posts, you might be wondering?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is all about engagement. The faster you can get engagement on a post, the more likely the algorithm will prioritize your post for more users. Then, the flywheel kicks in because more people will engage with your post, and the algorithm will show it to even more people.<\/p>\n<p>So, timing your post for the most early engagement is key to getting more overall engagement.

This is closely followed by Wednesday and Tuesday, which isn\u2019t a surprise if you take a look at the best days by industry. Many of them include one or both days.<\/p>\n<p>In mid-2024, the social media management platform <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin\/#The_best_time_to_post_on_LinkedIn_by_day_of_the_week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a> analyzed 1 million social media posts and determined that posts on Tuesday received the most engagement. This tracks with the data from multiple studies that point toward Tuesday as a peak day for most industries. At the same time, Thursday appears regularly, too.<\/p>\n<p>Our take: <strong>Keep prioritizing posts on both Tuesdays and Thursdays<\/strong>. If you\u2019re able to share quality content multiple times a week, that will be better for growing your following and generating engagement, anyway.<\/p>\n<div id=\"worst-days-to-post-on-linkedin\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are the worst days to post on LinkedIn?<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn has over <a href=\"https:\/\/news.linkedin.com\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1 billion users<\/a>, with more than 250 million of these individuals in the United States. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/50-linkedin-statistics-every-professional-should-ti9ue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top industries<\/a> on the platform include technology, financial services, and higher education. These are industries with Monday-to-Friday job schedules, most often with typical office hours.<\/p>\n<p>With this majority in mind, it\u2019s no wonder that the slow days on LinkedIn are Saturday and Sunday. Buffer\u2019s research backs that up, noting a considerable drop in engagement for any posts on those days.<\/p>\n<p>While some influencers on the platform maintain their activity level every day, the data suggests that it isn\u2019t moving the needle for brand accounts.

Unfortunately, LinkedIn won\u2019t add in the time for each post. But you can export the data and add this yourself to identify patterns (specifically, the times that posts tend to perform well and the times when they don\u2019t).<\/li>\n<li>Use this data to inform your posting schedule, and keep checking on it to refine your plan and grow your account.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>TL;DR: When to post on LinkedIn<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, the best times to post on LinkedIn are Tuesdays and Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. in your local time zone.
