To be frank, a holiday marketing plan that doesn\u2019t include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/09\/google-ads-networks\">Google Ads<\/a> is an <strong>incomplete<\/strong> holiday marketing plan. Meeting prospects in the search results\u2014both with text ads <em>and<\/em> Shopping ads\u2014is absolutely essential. Elsewhere, using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">display ads<\/a> to stay top-of-mind is an effective tactic as well. With that, let\u2019s get into some tips.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Attract more clicks with Merchant Promotions<\/h3>\n<p>Merchant Promotions is a free feature that enables Google Shopping advertisers to make their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">Shopping ads<\/a> more compelling by adding special offers like discounted prices, free gifts, and shipping benefits. Once you\u2019ve submitted a product data feed in Google Merchant Center and it\u2019s gotten a thumbs up, you can start creating promotions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e6189656-2910-406d-80d9-48d0ee6a5141\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-tips-merchant-promotions.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-google-merchant-promotions\" width=\"674\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two ways you can take advantage of Merchant Promotions: by using the promotions tool or by uploading a designated promotions feed. Whereas the promotions tool\u2014found by selecting <strong>Merchant Promotions<\/strong> from the left-hand menu and then selecting <strong>Promotions<\/strong>\u2014allows you to create specific offers for individual products, a promotions feed allows you to bulk upload a high volume of promotions at one time.<\/p>\n<p>Although you can never go wrong with a discounted price or free shipping, I think a particularly good offer for the holiday season is a gift card. Why? Because it allows shoppers to show their loved ones that they\u2019re thoughtful while <em>also<\/em> giving them a little bit of insurance.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>New to Google Shopping? We&#8217;ve got you covered. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our free guide to building successful\u00a0campaigns<\/a> and start winning new customers today!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Inspire urgency with text ad customizers<\/h3>\n<p>For those of you running standard search campaigns in addition to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Shopping campaigns<\/a>, text ad customizers allow you to automatically optimize your ad copy in real time based on query, location, device, time of day, or day of the week. Once you\u2019ve uploaded an ad customizer data file to your Google Ads account, you can start tailoring your messaging to create the most relevant and enticing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/10\/holiday-ppc-advertising-lead-gen\">holiday PPC ads<\/a> possible.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ebac3aaf-e67b-40f8-9e06-3df236126d54\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-tips-ad-customizers.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-inspire-urgency\" width=\"800\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-adwords-if-functions-text-ads-268411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Engine Land<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although ad customizers are useful in general and allow you to optimize in myriad different ways, in the context of holiday marketing ideas we\u2019re primarily interested in using them to <strong>create a sense of urgency<\/strong> among your prospects.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re using text ads to promote your extended Black Friday sale, you could use an ad customizer to tell shoppers how much time they have left. Whereas someone shopping the night before Thanksgiving would see \u201cOnly 48 Hours Left!\u201d in your headline, someone shopping the night <em>of<\/em> Thanksgiving would see \u201cOnly 24 Hours Left!\u201d In effect, you can take advantage of ad customizers to create a countdown to the end of your sale.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Tame competitive keywords with audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For an ecommerce business, a key part of preparing for the holidays is compiling lists of seasonally relevant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keywords<\/a>: \u201cblack friday deals,\u201d \u201choliday season sales,\u201d and so on. Because the shoppers behind these keywords are obviously commercially motivated, getting your products and offers in front of them is incredibly valuable.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial to keep in mind, however, that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition\">competition<\/a> for these keywords is <em>intense<\/em>. If you bid on them without any additional filters, your campaign budgets will dry up in no time. That\u2019s why we recommend layering your expensive keywords with <strong>audience targeting<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c8480eba-6000-4a0f-b157-d0520df7f5d2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-google-ads-customer-match.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-customer-match-effectiveness\" width=\"749\" height=\"479\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Although the keyword remains the primary tool for targeting relevant shoppers with search campaigns, Google has gradually built a strong suite of audience targeting solutions over the years. Take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/02\/adwords-customer-match-setup\">Customer Match<\/a>, for example\u2014a tool that allows you to target past customers who\u2019ve voluntarily given you their contact information.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Save last-minute shoppers with local inventory ads<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This holiday <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/18\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\">e-commerce marketing<\/a> tip is specifically for retailers who own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/24\/local-marketing-tips\">brick-and-mortar stores<\/a> in addition to managing their ecommerce presence. As many of you likely know from your personal lives, a lot of people procrastinate when it comes to buying gifts for their friends and family. In fact, some are <em>so<\/em> late to the party that they don\u2019t start looking until <em>after<\/em> your shipping cut-off\u2014the last day people can buy from your online store and get their orders in time for the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>Good news: Your business can save the day for these last-minute holiday shoppers. With a local inventory ad (LIA), you can advertise your brick-and-mortar store to nearby shoppers who are looking for a product you sell. As you can see below, users who click on your LIA are taken to a Google-hosted page known as <strong>your local storefront<\/strong>. Here, they\u2019ll learn when your store is open, how much you have in stock, how much they\u2019ll have to spend, and more.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"36447c42-d6ee-47b8-88c9-a040345b4148\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-local-inventory-ads.jpg\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-google-local-inventory-ads\" width=\"716\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/3057972?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Important note: <\/strong>As effective as local inventory ads can be near the end of the holiday season, they <em>do<\/em> require a bit of extra leg work.

Save last-minute shoppers with electronic gift cards<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you <em>don\u2019t<\/em> have a brick-and-mortar presence, you can still save the day for your procrastination-prone prospects. Once your shipping cut-off has passed, we recommend ramping up your offers for electronic gift cards. True\u2014most people (for the sake of showing their loved ones how thoughtful and punctual they are) would prefer to buy a tangible product. Nonetheless, when the clock is ticking and placing a traditional order is out of the question, shoppers will be grateful for the option of buying a gift card.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2a87086a-0efb-485b-a77f-31af36940638\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-tips-google-shopping-gift-card-promotion.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-gift-card-merchant-promotion\" width=\"700\" height=\"469\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Best of all: <\/strong>Turning up the volume on electronic gift cards doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop promoting actual products. Remember those Merchant Promotions we talked about earlier? One type of promotion you can run is tacking a gift card on top of orders over a certain dollar amount. That way, you can entice last-minute shoppers by offering them an easy solution while <em>simultaneously<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/06\/how-to-market-a-product\">marketing a relevant product<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6.

As effective as that tactic can be, you may find that you want (or need) to avoid pricey keywords altogether. This is where our final Google Ads tip comes into play: Connect with your prospects on the Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Display Network<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Despite the relative lack of commercial intent found on the display network, there are two key tactics you can use to drive value out of your display ads this holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>First up: <strong>custom intent audiences<\/strong>. With one of these, you can give Google a collection of keywords and website URLs related to the offer you want to promote with your display ads. Then, Google will create an audience of users actively looking to make a purchase related to those keywords and URLs and serve them your ads. Generally, this is more effective than using one of the in-market audiences Google provides.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b15d05d1-1431-494d-a64b-3c2222171a82\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-custom-intent-audiences.jpg\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-display-network-custom-intent-audience\" width=\"759\" height=\"698\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second: <strong>responsive display ads<\/strong>. With this ad type, Google takes your marketing assets\u2014images, videos, logos, headlines, copy, etc.\u2014and dynamically creates display ads that fit the various pages and devices they\u2019re showing on. What a lot of advertisers don\u2019t realize is that you can add promotional text to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/23\/responsive-display-ads\">responsive display ads<\/a>. If you\u2019re using the display network to remarket to your holiday season prospects, sweeten the deal with a promotion like free shipping or a discounted price!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important note:<\/strong> If you\u2019re going to run holiday season display ads, get your creative assets ready to go as soon as possible!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Holiday marketing tips for Facebook &amp; Instagram Ads<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wrapping up the Google Ads portion of our holiday marketing guide with tips for the display network provides the perfect segue to our next section: Facebook and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As crucial as it is to capitalize on the high commercial intent behind holiday season search queries, it\u2019s important to remember that <strong>your prospects don\u2019t stop using social media in November and December<\/strong>. In fact, many shoppers see Facebook and Instagram as sources of <em>inspiration<\/em> for gifts they can buy for their loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s get into some more tips for increasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/09\/instagram-sales\">holiday sales on Instagram<\/a> and Facebook.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">7. Appease the algorithm by slowly upping your budget<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019ll often hear Facebook marketers refer to \u201cthe learning phase\u201d\u2014the process of Facebook\u2019s algorithm experimenting with the delivery of your ads to determine what works best according to your objective. Generally speaking, each ad set needs to drive about 50 conversions in order to complete the learning phase.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/112167992830700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Facebook<\/a>, the learning phase resets every time you make a \u201csignificant edit\u201d to your ad set\u2014and that includes changes to your budget. In order to keep up with your competitors during the holiday season, you\u2019ll most certainly have to increase your ad sets\u2019 budgets. However, if you abruptly make these changes all at once, all of your ads sets will re-enter the learning phase\u2014thus diminishing your performance at a time when you need performance to be better than ever.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a775af09-d93a-4cf8-bc8c-f3328342b747\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-facebook-budget.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-facebook-ad-set-budget\" width=\"453\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you do: <strong>Increase your ad sets\u2019 budgets little by little over time<\/strong>.

Fill your funnel with audience list building<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The holiday season is a time to make sales\u2014<strong>not<\/strong> a time to build brand awareness.

That way, when the time comes to make sales, you\u2019ll have pools of relevant users who\u2019ve already demonstrated an interest in your business.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"905edb9a-13c8-4fce-9ee2-09c76ce602c9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-custom-audience-sources.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-facebook-custom-audience-sources\" width=\"555\" height=\"236\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Some of the options you\u2019ll have for audiences down the line.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Examples are useful here. Let\u2019s say you plan on using the holiday season to promote a big discount on your signature custom phone cases. A month or two before your sale starts, you could run a video views campaign in which you share time lapse videos of the creation process. Alternatively, you could run a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/facebook-lead-ads\">lead generation<\/a> campaign in which you target users who may be interested in your email newsletter.

A great way to score some (relatively) easy wins and drive additional ROI from your inevitably higher budget is to target users who bought products from your store during <em>last year\u2019s<\/em> holiday season.

Using those past customers as a seed audience, Facebook will generate a group of new users who behave similarly. This enables you to reach new shoppers while feeling confident they\u2019ll convert!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Holiday marketing tips for your website<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our final three holiday marketing tips all involve optimizations you can make on your own ecommerce website. As crucial as it is to build robust audiences and create amazing ads, you still need to invest some time in making sure you\u2019re giving your site visitors the best experience possible. After all, the holiday season can be an enormously stressful time; few people will have the time or patience to put up with a sub-par <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/25\/ecommerce-user-experience\">user experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">11. Generate hype by getting the word out early<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the weeks leading up to your holiday season sales, get your site visitors\u2019 mouths watering by letting them know what\u2019s to come! The best thing about this tactic is that it doesn\u2019t need to be strenuous; something as simple as a countdown to the start of your sales should be enough to get prospective shoppers excited.<\/p>\n<p>Although your homepage is certainly a strong (and high-traffic) place to start, don\u2019t make it the <em>only<\/em> site of hype generation. If someone is perusing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product page<\/a> or finalizing a purchase, why not let them know that they can come back in a couple weeks and enjoy your lowest prices of the year? By planting that seed in your site visitors\u2019 heads, you give yourself a better chance of winning their wallets when the time comes for them to hunt for deals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bd9d3a59-69a8-4b07-879b-427a95a31b48\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-generate-hype.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-generate-hype-on-website\" width=\"632\" height=\"303\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>What better place to promote upcoming sales?<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to go the extra mile, you can include a blurb about your upcoming holiday season sales in the confirmation emails you send to people who\u2019ve just placed orders on your site: <em>\u201cThank you for your order! Come back on Nov. 22 for our best deals of the year.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Who could resist an offer like <em>that<\/em>?<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">12. Own organic search by creating gift-specific pages<\/h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/?geo=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a>, the search queries \u201cgifts for mom\u201d and \u201cgifts for dad\u201d peak in the middle of December. \u201cGifts for her\u201d and \u201cgifts for him\u201d <em>also<\/em> spike around this time, though not to the extent that they do at the beginning of February. Evidently, holiday shoppers don\u2019t always head to Google with a specific product or brand in mind; often, they\u2019re hunting for gifts for specific <em>people<\/em> in their lives.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8deb774-c600-4b03-93bb-e0b6b922abb4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-google-trends.png\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-google-trends-chart\" width=\"764\" height=\"222\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interest in \u201cgifts for mom\u201d throughout the year.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From an SEO perspective, this presents (nice, Conor) an amazing opportunity\u2014an opportunity that only the most prepared ecommerce businesses will be able to capitalize on. By creating new, dedicated pages on your site that are optimized for keywords like \u201cgifts for mom\u201d and \u201cgifts for him,\u201d you improve your chances of ranking highly in the organic search results and getting your products in front of eager shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this an important holiday marketing tip? Because when a search query triggers both paid and organic results, the user is more likely to browse the latter than the former. To truly step up your marketing during the holiday season, you need to think about both parts of the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>For more guidance, we recommend checking out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">beginner\u2019s guide to SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">13. Cross-sell like crazy with relevant pop-ups<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We made it! We\u2019ve got one last holiday marketing tip for all you online retailers out there: Use the power of pop-ups to cross-sell your site visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve never worked with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/pop-ups-vs-chatbots\">pop-ups<\/a> in your professional life, you\u2019re most certainly familiar with them in your personal life: They\u2019re the (sometimes annoying) windows that suddenly pop up on your screen while you\u2019re looking at a web page.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"52a259f9-61d8-4099-b710-a47567f9a1b9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-ideas-ecommerce-pop-up.jpg\" alt=\"holiday-marketing-tips-cross-sell-with-pop-ups\" width=\"778\" height=\"431\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I describe pop-ups as <em>sometimes<\/em> annoying for a reason: Pop-ups don\u2019t need to be annoying! In fact, when they\u2019re used thoughtfully and <strong>with the experience of the user in mind<\/strong>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sumo.com\/stories\/pop-up-statistics\">they can actually be helpful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of ecommerce holiday marketing, you can use pop-ups to advertise related products to your site visitors. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a cartoonist and you use your website to sell prints and merchandise. If one of your loyal readers is perusing the product page for one of your prints, you can use a pop-up to advertise a t-shirt that features the same strip. Because the product you\u2019re using a pop-up to advertise is <em>relevant<\/em>, your disruption of the user experience isn\u2019t all that disruptive.<\/p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget to send a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/29\/holiday-customer-appreciation-letter\">friendly holiday greeting email<\/a> to your customers!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s not too early: Start putting these holiday marketing tips to use!<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although, as I said before, the holiday season is a stressful time for pretty much everyone, it\u2019s particularly intense for ecommerce businesses. True\u2014it gives you a tremendous amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a> to convert into sales. But it <em>also<\/em> gives you a tremendous amount of competition to keep up with.<\/p>\n<p>Though we don\u2019t have all the answers, we hope you\u2019ll put some of these holiday marketing tips to good use.
