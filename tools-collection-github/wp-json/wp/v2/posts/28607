Put simply, the way you structure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-not-working\">Google Ads<\/a> account allows you to control how you want your ads to be triggered and when and where you want them to appear. Not having a well-structured account is like attempting to drive a car that\u2019s not properly built&#8211;accidents are bound to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that having a well-structured account will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that the searches triggering your ads are relevant to your audience.<\/li>\n<li>Result in better Quality Scores, which, in turn, brings better results and lower prices. Quality score is essentially the scale of how much Google likes you (and trust me, you want Google to love you!).<\/li>\n<li>Keep you organized and able to optimize. If your account is a mess, then you\u2019re likely to get lost in the mess, your results will plummet (or never arrive), and optimizing to get better results will be out of the question.

Luckily, there are a few different methods that work well:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Based on the structure of your website:<\/strong>\u00a0How is your website structured? Do you have different tabs or pages for different products or offerings? Do you value different product pages over others? If your website is well-structured (which it should be), then it makes sense to structure your Google Ads account in a similar fashion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>By products\/services offered: <\/strong>This is likely the same as the structure of your website, but think about your different services or products offered and structure your account in a similar fashion. For example, let\u2019s say you sell tennis gear; you would want to create a campaign for tennis rackets, tennis balls, tennis clothing, etc. Then, under the tennis rackets campaign, you might create separate ad groups for the brands you sell or perhaps for the size or gender the racket is for. Take a look at your various offerings and decide which ones are most valuable. Is there a very large demand for tennis bags online? Then you might want to run a campaign for tennis bags with a higher budget. Spend some time mapping out your products and deciding how you want to divvy up your budget between campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Based on locations: <\/strong>Is location important to your business? Maybe you\u2019re a law office that has <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/opening-new-location-7-ways-promote-it\/\">multiple locations<\/a> across New England, or perhaps you sell development courses in major cities ranging from London to Tokyo. If location targeting is important, then structure it based on this. For example, create a London campaign to sell your development course to only those in a particular radius of the city.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, there are many other tactics to structuring your account, but it\u2019s all about taking the time to come up with a rational structure that will be easy to manage, track, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/ppc-performance\">optimize<\/a> to get the best results over time. So take the time to ponder various structuring techniques, and decide on the one that works best for your business. Once you\u2019ve decided, I\u2019d recommend actually mapping out the structure on a piece of paper or in an Excel doc to get a full visual of the campaigns and ad groups you\u2019ll be creating. Now, onto a couple more Google Ads account structure tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perform regular audits: <\/strong>Like with anything in small business marketing, you need to check in on your Google Ads performance regularly. When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/15\/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid\">audit your Google Ads account<\/a> on a scheduled basis, you\u2019re able to find areas for optimization before they turn into headaches.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be wary of auto-apply recommendations: <\/strong>Advice from Google Ads is like advice from a stranger\u2014take it with a grain of salt. Google\u2019s auto-applied ads and other optimization recommendations can be helpful at times where you\u2019re short of ideas, but at the end of the day, you will know what\u2019s best for your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"campaigns\">\n<h2>The campaign level<\/h2>\n<p>In general, a marketing campaign can mean anything, but in Google Ads, the term \u201ccampaign\u201d is the bucket that houses your ad groups. You&#8217;ll set your budget, targeting, the type of ad you want to run, and more at the campaign level. As mentioned above, you can only have one ad <em>type<\/em> per campaign, but you&#8217;ll have multiple ad <em>groups<\/em> per campaign and multiple campaigns per account.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the different campaign types in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>Here are the seven different campaign types in Google Ads to be aware of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Search: <\/strong>Text ads that appear on Google Search<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong> Display:<\/strong> Image ads that appear on websites in the Google Display Network<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong> Shopping: <\/strong>Product ads on Google Search and the Shopping tab<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong> Video: <\/strong>Animated ads on YouTube and the Display Network<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong> Demand Gen:<\/strong> Immersive ads that appear on multiple Google networks<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong> App: <\/strong>Ads for your app across multiple Google networks<span>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance Max: <\/strong>Ads created from various assets shown across all of Google\u2019s eligible networks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-run-google-ads-google-ads-campaign-types.webp\" alt=\"how to run google ads - google ads campaign types options screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90243 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-run-google-ads-google-ads-campaign-types.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-run-google-ads-google-ads-campaign-types-480x255.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Another note: <\/strong>For this post, our anatomy will follow that of an advertiser using Search, Display, and\/or Video campaigns.

Different campaign types can help you hit different<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\"> PPC metrics<\/a>, so it\u2019s in your best interest to try at least one or two when starting out.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you may want to run a search campaign to catch folks while they&#8217;re searching on Google, as well as a display campaign for when they&#8217;re browsing other sites across the web. Some campaigns are industry-specific and may not be needed, like Shopping (for ecommerce businesses) or App campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg\" alt=\"google ads account structure - example account layout\" width=\"935\" height=\"558\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94410 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-example-480x286.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How many campaigns should I have?<\/h3>\n<p>This will all depend on your business size, business model, budget, and more. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer when it comes to what campaign types you should have or how many of them, but it\u2019s a best practice to keep it as manageable as possible.<\/p>\n<p>So, for example, if you\u2019re a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/19\/google-ads-for-small-businesses\">small business running Google Ads<\/a> and don\u2019t have the overall budget or bandwidth to realistically stretch across 10 or 20 campaigns, it\u2019s better to start small with one or two for effective advertising rather than be overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you might not always have all your campaigns running at once. You might have seasonal offers, for example, or campaigns that you only run when you have the inventory or budget.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the best Google Ads campaign structure?<\/h3>\n<p>This is all going to depend on your business size, type, model, and more. There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all formula, but there are some options to consider. Similar to how you&#8217;d approach your overall account structure, take a look at how you group your offerings on your website to inspire your campaign makeup. What do you have unique pages for? Which pages are most popular or of the highest value? If your website is well-structured, you might want to adopt the same system for your campaigns. For <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/franchise-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-location businesses<\/a>, it might make sense to run campaigns by location since location targeting is set at the campaign level.<\/p>\n<h3>Campaign-level settings<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to play around with at the campaign level, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Campaign name:<\/strong> Similar to account name, this is how you\u2019ll refer to your campaign and has no impact on performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Status:<\/strong> Paused, enabled, or removed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion goal:<\/strong> What you want your campaign to achieve in relation to your conversion actions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Budget:<\/strong> Roughly how much your campaign will spend per day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid strategy:<\/strong> How aggressively you want to bid, based on your goals.

Plus, they often work synergistically. For example, display campaigns can build brand awareness and improve your search ad performance. Of course, some campaign types are industry-specific and may not apply to your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep them organized. <\/strong>Break out your campaigns so they map to your business <span>goals<\/span>, such as by product or service type, conversion action type, sales funnel stages, or locations. And establish a naming convention that makes sense to anyone managing the account.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Separate out branded campaigns. <\/strong>These campaigns behave and perform differently from <span>non-branded<\/span> campaigns, so it\u2019ll be best to budget for, strategize, and report on these separately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 <\/strong><strong>Is your Google Ads account structure in need of a refresh?<\/strong> Find out, and get an instant account report, using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ad-groups\"><\/div>\n<h2>The ad group level<\/h2>\n<p>Going down one tier under campaigns, we have ad groups. Each ad group contains a group of related keywords, their associated ads, and a landing page. One sidenote, though, for PMax campaigns, these are known as asset groups.<\/p>\n<h3>I only want to create one ad&#8211;why do I need an ad group?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice when creating an ad that you\u2019re prompted to create an ad group. This is a required part of the process, even if you just want one ad. But as we\u2019ll talk about later, it\u2019s best to<strong> have at least two different versions of your ad<\/strong> so you can test and see what performs best.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, you won\u2019t have just one ad in your Google Ads account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s an example to explain why: <\/strong>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a home service business and you want to advertise two main offers: installations and repairs. Installations are of higher value to you than repairs, so you separate these into two different campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>That way, you can allocate more budget toward installations (because, as we just learned, budget is set at the campaign level, not the ad level). But you have different types of installations, like windows, gutters, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You want to keep the same location, network, and device targeting for each of these offers\u2014so it works to keep them in the same campaign\u2014but the targeted keywords and ad copy for your window installation ad will, of course, be totally different from your gutter installation ad.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for your different types of repairs. So, you\u2019ll want to have a separate ad group for each type of installation. Not only will this keep your account organized, but it will also keep your costs low.<\/p>\n<h3>How do thematic ad groups lower my ad costs?<\/h3>\n<p>The higher your Quality Score, the lower your cost per click, and you achieve high Quality Scores by keeping your ads and landing pages super relevant to their keywords. So, if you put all of your installation ads in one ad group, you\u2019ll have window installation ads connected to gutter installation keywords\u2014not very relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you can only have one landing page per ad group, so you\u2019d need to make it general enough to cover everything\u2014once again, not very relevant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you separate your ad groups out, you can ensure tight alignment between your keywords, ad, and landing page for a better play in the Google Ads auction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg\" alt=\"google ads cost - google ads auction formula\" width=\"935\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How many ad groups should I have per campaign?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>You should have no more than roughly 7-10 ad groups per campaign. <\/strong>You\u2019ll most likely need even less than that. The more centralized to your main goals or offerings, the better. If you have a ton of ad groups, that\u2019s a sign you need another campaign!<\/p>\n<h3>How many keywords should I have per ad group?<\/h3>\n<p>You should have only one keyword theme per ad group (as we established), so you may only need to start with 10-20 keywords max. With all the keyword matching updates, we don\u2019t need as many as we once did, so stick to your core terms and avoid muddying up the waters with a ton of variations.<\/p>\n<h3>How many ads should I have per ad group?<\/h3>\n<p>You should aim to have two or three ads per ad group. This is a little confusing since responsive search ads themselves rotate through different copy combinations within the same ad, but you should still always be testing more than one overall approach or tone at a time, such as an RSA with a set of positively-framed headlines and descriptions vs one with those that are negatively framed.<\/p>\n<p>Note that<strong> you can only have three enabled RSAs per ad group<\/strong>, or otherwise you\u2019ll get a flag that looks like this when you try to create another ad:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg\" alt=\"google ads account structure flag\" width=\"505\" height=\"210\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94405 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg 505w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag-480x200.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Ad group-level settings<\/h3>\n<p>Here is a quick preview of what you can adjust at the ad group level:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ad group name:<\/strong> Same as campaign and account levels, name your ad groups what would make the most sense to you.
