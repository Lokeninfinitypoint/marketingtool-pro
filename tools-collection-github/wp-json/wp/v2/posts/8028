If you want more customers, better performance, and higher revenue, you need to have a purpose driven culture of engaged employees. And this cannot happen without established core values.

The sales team has a different mindset from the web team. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/19\/content-marketing-skills\">Content marketers<\/a> have a different focus from<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/16\/product-marketing\"> product marketers<\/a>. But like a human being, separate systems are needed in order for the whole to operate properly.<\/p>\n<p>Core values are department-agnostic, serving as the common thread that brings everyone together to create one collective \u201cus.\u201d Unified operation translates into output that is greater than the sum of its parts.<\/p>\n<h3>Make better decisions<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses are run by great minds that <em>don\u2019t always<\/em> think alike\u2014<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/28\/diversity-in-marketing\">diversity<\/a> of perspectives is important.

Your company core values guide the way each person can carry out their role. Consistent, meaningful behavior between employees and with customers, partners, and vendors speaks volumes to the integrity of your brand and its overall reputation.<\/p>\n<h3>Become resilient<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s workforce is more transient than ever.\u00a0But when a company hires, fires, and operates according to a steadfast set of core values, it is prepared to withstand changes in staff, losses in leadership, or even entire reorgs.<\/p>\n<h2>How to establish your company core values<\/h2>\n<p>Core values should be a mix of those that describe your company as it is now as well as what it strives to be. They should celebrate but also motivate; evoke pride but also inspire action.<\/p>\n<p>In a former job, I once was tasked with establishing the company&#8217;s core values. I&#8217;m going to go over a high-level view of the six steps I took to do this, which you can adapt accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Note: For a smaller company, a full team meeting might be all it takes!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Consult your employees<\/h3>\n<p>Send out a survey to your employees and ask questions about what\u2019s important to them, what they prioritize when interacting with customers, what they like about working for the company, and what they\u2019d like to see more of.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t explicitly state that you\u2019re trying to determine core values. Leave it open-ended so you can pick up on patterns and translate them into core values that use the language of your employees.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Ask your customers<\/h3>\n<p>Talk or send out a poll to your customers, asking them for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a> like what stands out to them about your business, why they choose your business, and what keeps them coming back. Read <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a> and see if there are any common themes.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Look back on key events<\/h3>\n<p>Think about memorable experiences in your company\u2019s past\u2014positive and negative. What actions were taken (or not taken) that made them memorable? Use this information to collect anecdotal clues about your inherent core values.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Map it out and whittle\u00a0it down<\/h3>\n<p>Compile all of this information in one place and see what kinds of patterns you can pick up on. Whittle it down into a list of ten or so values that reflect the input. You can then have a meeting with select team members to come up with the three to\u00a0five core values that make the most sense.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Describe them using your brand voice<\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to use your marketers and content writers. Core values can get pretty redundant and generic. Come up with unique names and [short] descriptions for those core values that match your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>. Feel free to make up words and get playful here.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Make em known!<\/h3>\n<p>Display your core values in a location in your office where employees can see them every day. Start off <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/07\/marketing-meetings\">meetings<\/a> with a core values slide and give employees an opportunity to recognize team members who have demonstrated them (that&#8217;s what we do!). Instate a company-wide core values award every month, where anyone can nominate anyone (we do that too!).<\/p>\n<p>And of course, put them on your about us or careers page to attract employees and customers who share your values. Or write a blog post like Flywheel did<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/flywheel-company-core-values-blog-post-1.png\" alt=\"flywheel blog post about their own company core values\" width=\"594\" height=\"399\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/getflywheel.com\/layout\/life-at-flywheel\/flywheel-values\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Company core values examples<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m going to provide a master core values list at the end of this post to help give you a starting point, but first, I want to provide some real company core values examples so you can have an idea of what other companies are doing.<\/p>\n<h3>1. The simple approach\u2014Beiersdorf<\/h3>\n<p>The Beiersdorf core values page is clean and simple. (Look, they\u2019re already demonstrating one of their core values.) While their values are generic, they are placed on a page with a video and related links that provide further reinforcement.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-beiersdorf-values-1.png\" alt=\"example of simple company core values by beiersdorf\" width=\"720\" height=\"605\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.beiersdorf.com\/about-us\/our-profile\/our-core-values\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. The branded approach\u2014Cogolabs<\/h3>\n<p>What I like about this page is the personalization they\u2019ve applied to their core values. You have a lot of freedom with your core values: you can make up names (CogoStars, Cogonauts), be a bit bragadocious, and go beyond the typical three to five.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, some of the uncommon ones like \u201cobsessive\u201d are more memorable and also compel you to read on to see what they mean.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-cogo-1.png\" alt=\"example of branded company core values by cogo labs\" width=\"720\" height=\"1038\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cogolabs.com\/culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cObsessive: We are tenacious in pursuit of our goals, and believe that success in life is proportional to the effort we put ini\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>3. The employee quote approach\u2014Outback Team Building<\/h3>\n<p>Outback\u2019s company core values take a unique approach by describing their core values through quotes by employees of varying points of the hierarchy<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-outback-1.png\" alt=\"employee quote-based company core values by outback team building\" width=\"720\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.outbackteambuilding.com\/about\/join-our-team\/#core-values\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in perpetual pursuit of new, innovative, outside-the-box ways to consistently improve ourselves, our products, and everything we do.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. The punny approach\u2014Flockjay<\/h3>\n<p>Flockjay\u2019s core values stand out to me with their unique word choice. Like Cogo Labs, they add color with their brand voice and use appropriate bird puns. But phrases like \u201cinvest in each other,\u201d \u201cwhole selves,\u201d \u201cbig bets,\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s do this by\u201d give them an authentic feel.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-flockjay-1.png\" alt=\"punny company core values example by flockjay\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/flockjay.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we flock together, we fly farther and faster than we can alone We support, celebrate, and in est in each other, working together to create an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their whole selves to work each day.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>5. The famous quote approach\u2014Grimm Bissel<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re a team of one or three. Maybe you\u2019re just starting out and don\u2019t have a wealth of employees and experiences that lead to clear core values and related links. There\u2019s nothing wrong with keeping it short and sweet with famous quotes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-grimm-bissell-1-1.png\" alt=\"example of famous quote-based company values by grimm bissell\" width=\"720\" height=\"422\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/grimmbissell.nm.com\/Our-Core-Values.15.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Commitment is an act, not a word -Jean Paul Sarte<\/p>\n<h3>6. The oath approach\u2014Zappos<\/h3>\n<p>The Zappos has a whopping 10 company core values and is compiled into a comprehensive \u201cOath of Employment.\u201d Each value comes with its own description, set of questions to ask yourself, sample behaviors, and video! I know that actions speak louder than words, but this page itself is an action. A company that makes this much effort to explain their core values is really serious about them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-zappos-1.png\" alt=\"example of more than 10 company core values by zappos\" width=\"720\" height=\"274\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zapposinsights.com\/about\/core-values\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Deliver WOW Through Service&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>7. The Keap approach<\/h3>\n<p>So Keap&#8217;s core values page isn&#8217;t anything revolutionary. But I have this on my list because a company&#8217;s core values aren&#8217;t really the photos you see of teams doing community service or receiving &#8220;Best Places to Work&#8221; awards. These outward-facing materials\u00a0are a manifestation of the mundane, day-to-day activities between employees that would be impossible to capture (and frankly, too boring to share) on social media.<\/p>\n<p>And Keaps&#8217; values statement says it all:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-examples-keap-values-statement-1.png\" alt=\"keap company core values example\" width=\"717\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Our values are an everyday process where leaders and Keapers through word and deed show that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We genuinely care<\/li>\n<li>We own it<\/li>\n<li>We learn always<\/li>\n<li>We build trust<\/li>\n<li>We check ego<\/li>\n<li>We dream big<\/li>\n<li>We win together&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>8. The acronym approach\u2014G2<\/h3>\n<p>Bonus points if your acronym is a core valuesy word, like G2&#8217;s &#8220;PEAK&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-core-values-fond-example-1.png\" alt=\"fond's company core values in acronym style\" width=\"695\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fond.co\/blog\/g2-core-values\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;<\/strong>G2 Core Values:<\/p>\n<p><strong>P<\/strong>erformance<br \/>\n<strong>E<\/strong>ntrepreneurial Spirit<br \/>\n<strong>A<\/strong>uthenticity<br \/>\n<strong>K<\/strong>indness&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Establish your company core values for customer, team, and revenue growth<\/h2>\n<p>With the information, steps, and examples above, you should now have a clear understanding of the importance of core values and a clear path for developing yours.
