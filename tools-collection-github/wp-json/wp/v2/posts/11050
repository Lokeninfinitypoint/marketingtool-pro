As both marketing and COVID-19 trends collide, PPC is becoming more important than ever in most companies&#8217; marketing strategies, while at the same time most marketing budgets are being reduced to lower than ever\u2014at least for now. What this means is, it\u2019s time to rethink how you manage your Google Ads during this \u201cnew normal\u201d period.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/optimize20google20ads20covid20trends.jpg\" alt=\"optimize google ads covid trends\" width=\"848\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Check out\u00a0our latest\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/06\/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">COVID-19 trend data here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The first and most urgent thing to do is to reduce costs while keeping your campaigns performing. So in this post, I\u2019m going to cover four ways to\u00a0optimize your Google Ads performance while on a reduced budget. They are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Get\u00a0rid of vanity metrics.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create an \u201cImpression to Conversion\u201d (ITC) column.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Add\u00a0more exact keywords (and pause\u00a0your phrase match).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use\u00a0In-Market Segments in Google Analytics.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There\u2019s also an important bonus tip at the end that you won\u2019t want to miss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to optimize your Google Ads account on a tight budget<\/h2>\n<p>For each of the below optimizations, I&#8217;ll explain how to do them and tie each one back to how it can either stretch your existing budget further, improve your ads&#8217; performance, or lower your costs.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. <span lang=\"EN\">Get rid of distracting vanity metrics<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Cutting down on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/29\/ppc-budget\">PPC budgets<\/a> for financial reasons means you have to make the most out of every minute and dollar you <em>do<\/em> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/26\/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit\">spend<\/a>. You need this efficiency in order to get through such a period and eventually get your budgets back to what they used to be. To be as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/30\/cost-effective-ad-types\">cost-effective<\/a> as possible, you need to be more focused, so here\u2019s what you need to do:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Get rid of data columns that you don\u2019t use on a daily basis, and\/or that do not bring you any added value in your day-to-day optimizations.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We all like to set up our own columns sets with different variations of data by which we want to track and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/ppc-performance\">optimize our campaigns<\/a>, but sometimes, having too much data in front of our eyes distracts us from the data that is really important, that we might be missing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, you might want to consider getting rid of columns such as \u201cSearch Imp. share,\u201d as on a tight budget, there\u2019s not much you can do about the fact that your competitors might still be bidding much higher than you. Instead, focus on the metrics you can actually influence, like your CTR, for example. Writing some new and improved ads with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/12\/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy\">compelling ad copy<\/a> can help <strong>raise your CTR without raising bids<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimizations20Search20impr.20share.png\" alt=\"google ads optimizations Search impr. share\" width=\"800\" height=\"381\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\">Set your columns to show only the essentials and put all of your focus on those, to make sure you\u2019re not missing out on anything you can change and optimize by yourself.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Are there opportunities for you to optimize your Google Ads account?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. <span lang=\"EN\">Create an \u201cImpression to Conversion\u201d (ITC) column<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After getting rid of those unnecessary columns, the next step in optimizing Google Ads performance on a reduced budget is to create new columns that will help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/24\/analyzing-google-adwords-ads\">analyze data faster<\/a>. This way, you can fully optimize your search campaigns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One such column is ITC, or Impression to Conversion. This is a custom column you create that will make your optimization much easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong><em><span lang=\"EN\">ITC % = Conversions\/Impressions<\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s how to create the ITC column in Google Ads:<\/span><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">In your Google Ads account, click \u201cColumns\u201d in the upper ribbon of the dashboard. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Now, click \u201cModify columns\u201d and go to the very bottom of the screen and click \u201cCustom columns.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20custom20columns.png\" alt=\"google ads optimization custom columns\" width=\"800\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">Now simply add the calculation of conversions\/impressions, as in the image below:<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20conversions3Aimpressions.png\" alt=\"google ads optimization conversions\/impressions\" width=\"800\" height=\"549\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You\u2019re done. All that\u2019s left to do is add the column to your dashboard and save.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">But why would we want to add another data set after I just advised you to drop some?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Well, the answer is simple: ITC helps us know the full performance of our ads in one simple column. Usually, we will measure an ad\u2019s click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) separately, in two different columns. But some ads with a high CVR will have a low CTR, and others will have a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/26\/high-ctr-benefits\"> high CTR <\/a>but a low CVR. So, should you keep the ones with high CVR,\u00a0or the ones with high CTR? What\u2019s the best prioritization when optimizing your Google Ads?<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">ITC helps you to quickly identify which ads in your Google Ads campaign are truly performing the best.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now you\u2019ll be even more focused and more quickly able to make decisions for your Google Ads performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. <span lang=\"EN\">Add more exact keywords (and pause your phrase match)\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The third strategy for optimizing your Google Ads performance on a reduced budget is adding more exact keywords. This is actually something you should always aim to do with your paid search campaigns, <strong>but when reducing your budget, you should spend most of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/16\/spend-less-time-in-google-ads\">PPC account management time<\/a> doing this.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But there\u2019s an important principle to it. Not only should you add more exact keywords, but you should <strong>also look for longer search terms to add<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a>). Longer exact match keywords:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Have a lower competition rate<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Allow you to bid lower<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Enable you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">write better and more accurate ads<\/a> (and if you\u2019re not familiar with the term <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/18\/underused-ppc-strategies\">SKAGs<\/a>, now would be a great time for that).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20long20tail20keywords20graph.jpg\" alt=\"google ads optimization long tail keywords graph\" width=\"798\" height=\"594\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Learn more about long-tail keywords <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/long-tail-keywords\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">How long should the exact match keywords be?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This can definitely vary between different advertisers, but for most, keywords that contain between 2-5 words should be the sweet spot. One-word keywords will probably be expensive and have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">low conversion rates<\/a>; and keywords with more than five words are likely to have a low search volume and may hardly get any traffic at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, let\u2019s say you want to run a Google Ad for hiking shoes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The keyword<strong><span lang=\"EN\"> [shoes]<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> will be too broadly targeted and expensive.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The keyword<strong><span lang=\"EN\"> [hiking shoes] <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">is a bit better. Now, your hiking shoes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/14\/ppc-landing-page-experience\">ad and landing page will be more closely related<\/a>, and you won\u2019t be competing against advertisers who use [shoes], \u201cshoes\u201d or +shoes as a keyword..<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">But let\u2019s go longer, with\u00a0<strong><span lang=\"EN\">[hiking shoes online]<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">,<strong> [red hiking shoes online]<\/strong>, and <strong>[online sale on hiking shoes]<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that\u2019s better. Imagine an ad group called \u201chiking shoes online\u201d that contains these keywords and displays a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/14\/ppc-landing-page-experience\">perfectly matching ad and landing page<\/a>. Such ad groups allow you to write more accurate and better-targeted ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Better targeting\u00a0means a higher CTR (and ITC), which means a higher quality score, which means lower bids.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is exactly why I started off by saying this is something you should always aim towards, but especially when lowering your Google Ads budget. With high budgets, you might want to go broader to gain more brand awareness or more conversions, even at a higher price. When lowering your budgets, you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">get the most conversions<\/a> at the lowest price possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Where to find the right keywords to add<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019ll start by telling you where <em>not<\/em> to find them: the Google Keyword Planner tool. There are two reasons for that:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The Google Keyword Planner tool is the most commonly used keyword research tool, which also means that most of your competitors are probably using it as well, which results in all of you competing for the same keywords.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The Google Keyword Planner will also list a lot of irrelevant keywords (or not the most relevant, depending on your search settings), which can defocus you or cost you a lot of time filtering the results manually. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The good news is, there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">great free keyword research tools<\/a> out there. Here are two of my personal favorites:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ubersuggest:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\">Ubersuggest is\u00a0will find very accurate search terms, along with very powerful data like volume, CPC, and trend.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20ubersuggest.png\" alt=\"google ads optimization ubersuggest\" width=\"800\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google Search Console:<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">Explore your Google search console account to find keywords that are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">driving traffic to your site<\/a>, and then add them to your search campaigns.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You may be thinking that it seems useless to pay for keywords that are already driving organic traffic to your site, but hear me out. It\u2019s basically the same argument as using your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\">brand name as a keyword<\/a> (which you should also definitely do). Adding more keywords to your campaigns\u2014even the ones that are already getting you organic traffic\u2014will allow you to get even more traffic out of them, and give you better control over what parts of your site visitors see and what messaging they encounter.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ultimately, more relevant traffic and better messaging\u00a0means more conversions.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But actually, that\u2019s not even the most beautiful part of it. Using the Search Console, you can find search terms that your site appears for in search results, but at a very low position and with no traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20search20console.png\" alt=\"google ads optimization search console\" width=\"800\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">These are definitely search terms you&#8217;ll\u00a0want to have in your campaigns as an exact match, which leads us to the next and final tip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb0 Want more Google Ads budgeting tips? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Free download <\/strong>&gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLDigestibleAdBudgets.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_GoogleAdsBudgetsGuide_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The Easy Guide to Google Ads Budgets<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. <span lang=\"EN\">Dive deep into Google Analytics with In-Market Segments<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let me start by saying that if your Google Ads account is not linked to your Google Analytics account, by all means, stop reading this post and go do that (but don\u2019t forget to come back)!\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/06\/link-adwords-to-analytics-guide\">Connecting your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts<\/a> is very simple and an absolute must!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Okay, so now that you\u2019ve connected the two accounts, let\u2019s talk about how you can use Google Analytics for more than just the typical metrics like bounce rate and time on site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In your Google Analytics account, click the \u201cAudience\u201d tab, and then \u201cIn-Market Segments.\u201d There, you\u2019ll find golden data. <strong>Google has segmented your site&#8217;s visitors according to what they are in the market for<\/strong><strong><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The numbers in the image below are hidden, but this tab will show you the exact results for each audience <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">segment<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimization20in20market20segments.png\" alt=\"google ads optimization in market segments\" width=\"800\" height=\"292\" \/><\/div>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">What can you do with In-Market Segments?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Create a goal out of the conversion you\u2019re aiming to achieve with your Google Ads campaigns, and then add it to this report. Now, look for the audiences that have the highest conversion rates. Did you find them? Great! Now, go to your Google Ads account and add these audiences to your campaigns (in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/02\/google-adwords-audience-tab-guide\">\u201cAudience\u201d tab<\/a>), and grant them a higher bid adjustment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, you might see that people in the market for \u201cFinancial Services\u201d are converting at a much higher rate than the overall conversion rate. So, add this audience to your campaigns, and give it a higher bid adjustment, let\u2019s say +20%. Now, Google will add 20% to your bids if it recognizes that the user is a part of this audience.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"EN\">In-Market Segments helps you to make sure you bid higher for audiences that are more likely to convert.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Even If you\u2019re using CPA bidding, you would still want to add these audiences. It never harms to gain more data, and you might find out there are some audiences you would want to focus on, or some that you might want to exclude.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20optimizations20on20a20tight20budget20in20market20segment.jpg\" alt=\"google ads optimizations on a tight budget in market segments\" width=\"614\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>From our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/17\/google-analytics-audience-reports\">using Google Analytics to find bigger and better audiences<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now, take everything you did with in market audiences and do the same with demographics and affinity categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Bonus tip: refine your search strategy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">During economic downturns like these, when most digital marketers have to cut down on ad spend, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/08\/seo-during-covid-19\">having a solid search strategy is more important than ever<\/a>, and for one simple reason:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Almost everyone\u2019s needs have changed<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> in the past few months, and <strong>they are looking for solutions<\/strong> to handle their own new normals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By adapting your\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/07\/18\/diversify-search-strategy-ppc\">search strategy<\/a>, you can be there when your ideal customers are searching\u00a0with intent, with exactly what they are searching for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Save time and money with these Google Ads optimizations<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re dealing with reduced bandwidth, a lower budget, or\u00a0just looking for ways to get more out of your ad spend, these tips will help you to lower your Google Ads costs while maintaining top performance.
