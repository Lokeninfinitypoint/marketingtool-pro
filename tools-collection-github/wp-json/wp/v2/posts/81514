And the time has finally come\u2014Google began phasing out third-party cookies for Chrome users in January of this year.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge: third-party cookies are what much of paid media relies on for performance tracking and targeting.

As mentioned, in January of 2024, Google began phasing out third-party cookies for Chrome users with the plan to retire all third-party cookies by the end of the year. So far, it\u2019s only impacting a small number of users, about 1%, but the plan for Google (and most other platforms) is to work away from third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out.webp\" alt=\"google third-party cookie phase out timeline\" width=\"936\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out-480x195.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you want to know more about the timeline for the third-party cookies phase-out, you can read <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/privacy-sandbox\/3pcd\/prepare\/prepare-for-phaseout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"why-is-google-getting-rid-of-cookies\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why is Google getting rid of cookies?<\/h2>\n<p>Google is going cookieless to address privacy concerns from users who want to limit how they\u2019re tracked online, what information is collected about them, and how their information is used.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe continue to invest in features that protect your data and provide more control over how it\u2019s used.

Review existing cookies to know what will be removed<\/h3>\n<p>Not all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/30\/cookie-consent-banner-examples\">cookies<\/a> that are added to your sites function the same way. Some will be fine and can stay, and others will be ignored\/removed moving forward. The good news is that you and\/or your developer can audit your existing cookies to find out which ones will cause issues and need your attention and which ones you can leave alone.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/chrome-third-party-cookies.webp\" alt=\"google third-party cookies allowed\" width=\"936\" height=\"571\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/chrome-third-party-cookies.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/chrome-third-party-cookies-480x293.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To start the audit process, follow the steps in <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/privacy-sandbox\/3pcd\/prepare\/audit-cookies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article<\/a>. There\u2019s even a YouTube video to walk you through it. There are a couple of options you can use. First would be through Chrome Developer Tools.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/checking-third-party-cookies.webp\" alt=\"Google developer tools to check existing third-party cookies\" width=\"936\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81601\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/checking-third-party-cookies.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/checking-third-party-cookies-480x258.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The second is with a custom Chrome Extension Google created called the <a href=\"https:\/\/chromewebstore.google.com\/detail\/privacy-sandbox-analysis\/ehbnpceebmgpanbbfckhoefhdibijkef?pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Either of these routes will help you identify which of your cookies need to be addressed and which will be compliant with the phase-out.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Take action for all third-party cookies based on platform<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google is only making the change to ignore third-party cookies. It\u2019s not providing solutions for the platforms using them.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the text Google provides for next steps:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/third-party-removal-recommendation-from-google.webp\" alt=\"third-party cookie removal recommendation from google\" width=\"936\" height=\"194\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/third-party-removal-recommendation-from-google.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/third-party-removal-recommendation-from-google-480x99.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, it\u2019s up to your platforms themselves to find solutions to the cookie phase-out. Depending on which ad platforms you use, you can conduct some quick searches to see what they suggest you do to help avoid tracking breakdowns, but on the whole, there are really two large shifts that most platforms are suggesting advertisers embrace and a few tactics to employ them, which we&#8217;ll cover next.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Embrace first-party data<\/h3>\n<p>The first large shift requires advertisers to take <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-data\/\">data collection<\/a> into your own hands. Rather than rely on the platforms provided third-party tracking, generating first-party data will help alleviate some of the privacy concerns with cookies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp\" alt=\"types of data collection for customers\" width=\"936\" height=\"563\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection-480x289.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because in a first-party relationship, the user directly provides their information to a company. It\u2019s not inferred or shared through a source that\u2019s external to the interaction between the brand and customer, like a Google pixel is.<\/p>\n<p>There are quite a few ways to generate first-party data for your business. Rather than go too far into detail here, I\u2019ll let Joe Martinez give you some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">ideas to get started<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb8 Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

Use first-party data the right way in ad platforms<\/h3>\n<p>I want to give you some ideas of how that first-party data can be used in the ad platforms.<\/p>\n<h4>Customer match or audience uploads<\/h4>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s Google Customer Match, Facebook Custom Audience Uploads, or a similar solution for another platform, most ad channels now let you import your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a> data into the system to match back to logged-in users. So any information you gather about your customers can be used to track them and create audiences of targetable users later on. (Again, see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">Joe\u2019s article<\/a> for ideas on how to generate that user information.)<\/p>\n<h4>Conversions API, enhanced conversions, and offline conversions<\/h4>\n<p>While Customer Uploads are for audience generation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/17\/google-ads-location-targeting\">targeting<\/a>, these solutions are focused on performance and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes\">conversion tracking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Conversions API is Facebook\u2019s solution for tracking in-platform performance by matching back to user attributes tracked in your CRM. This process usually takes the assistance of a developer, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/232481544843294?id=818859032317965\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here are the steps<\/a> to implement it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/17\/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions\">Enhanced Conversions<\/a> are a solution for Google Ads where user data provided on your website is hashed and sent back to Google privately. This relies on some tagging with the Google Site Tag but is compliant with these shifts as all information is anonymized before being shared. This can be done in a few ways: using your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13258081?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Site Tag<\/a> or through <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13262500?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Tag Manager<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work.webp\" alt=\"how enhanced conversions for leads works in google ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76940\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/30\/offline-conversion-tracking\">Offline Conversions from Google<\/a> are similar to Facebook\u2019s Conversions API where your CRM data is used to match to logged-in users on Google and track conversion performance. Usually, these are used for conversion actions that do not take place on a website, like a purchase of a service after receiving a quote online, but they can be used to fill in gaps in online conversions in some instances. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/30\/offline-conversion-tracking\">Here\u2019s a rundown of Offline Conversions with some helpful links to get you set up<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With these three suggestions, you\u2019re now focused on gathering data through a first-party relationship and leveraging it in your accounts for more accurate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/search-audiences\">audiences<\/a> and performance tracking, but these solutions aren\u2019t going to be foolproof. There will always be gaps. Additionally, this doesn\u2019t address the other side of the equation: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">how you find users to target<\/a> in the first place. That\u2019s where our second shift comes into play.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Embrace AI and machine learning<\/h3>\n<p>It seems like these have been the hot topics for the last five years, but they\u2019re more important than ever in a world with increasing privacy restrictions. Unfortunately, one of the key ways most of the amazing targeting we\u2019ve gotten used to over the last two decades was through third-party cookies. Now that those are being phased out, we need to find a new solution.<\/p>\n<p>As Google puts it, we need to move into an \u201cEra of Prediction.\u201d The platform algorithms have arguably been better at finding customers for many businesses in the last few years, but with the removal of third-party cookies, this gap between their abilities and ours as advertisers will get even wider.<\/p>\n<p>Google is continuing to push <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">broad match keywords<\/a> coupled with Smart Bidding on Search but also suggests starting new campaigns with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\">Maximize Conversion bidding strategies<\/a>, even if your account isn\u2019t meeting the traditional 50 conversions in 30 days threshold.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/advantage-audience.webp\" alt=\"advantage+ audience controls\" width=\"821\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81604\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/advantage-audience.webp 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/advantage-audience-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook is also pushing its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eqz2xWlO2To\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advantage+ Audience targeting<\/a> where advertisers suggest interests, behaviors, and demographic data that Facebook uses as a guide, but willingly goes beyond to meet campaign and ad set level objectives. Sound familiar?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-search-signals.webp\" alt=\"google search signals\" width=\"911\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-search-signals.webp 911w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-search-signals-480x315.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 911px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For Google, that type of targeting is mostly associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations\">Performance Max<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\">Demand Gen campaigns<\/a>, Google\u2019s new favorite solutions for everything that use Audience Signals to get started, but then target users through machine learning that it thinks will hit performance goals.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s machine learning for targeting or bidding optimizations, it\u2019s going to be imperative for advertisers to embrace AI in some way, shape, or form, to continue to see success with campaign performance.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"what-to-expect-from-cookieless-future\"><\/div>\n<h2>What should you expect next in this cookieless future?<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve completed all of these changes for your accounts, or at least the ones that are applicable, it\u2019s still going to be an adjustment as none of the solutions will be as \u201cperfect\u201d as the current setup. (I put \u201cperfect\u201d in quotes because anyone who has ever tried to nail down proper attribution knows there\u2019s no \u201cperfect\u201d solution at the moment.)<\/p>\n<p>Overall, here are the things I suggest you prepare yourself for in the future:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift advertising focus to first-party data.<\/li>\n<li>Plan to utilize your CRM\/internal tracking to understand campaign performance, but also know that\u2026<\/li>\n<li>Performance tracking will not be perfect, or likely close to as good as it is now.<\/li>\n<li>Embrace machine learning and AI for targeting and bidding optimization and expect to rely less on manual inputs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Prepare your PPC accounts for a cookieless future<\/h2>\n<p>The shift away from third-party cookies is underway and there\u2019s nothing we can do to change that.
