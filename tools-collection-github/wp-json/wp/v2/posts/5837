We all have better things to do, like binge-watching Breaking Bad or looking at pictures of babies trying to lift weights. Finger exercise was the last remnant of physical activity for office drones, which means this future is only a few decades away:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e4070a40-c83b-47a5-8ab2-258020692882\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/voice-search-1.png\" alt=\"Google Voice Local Search\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Thanks Google!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We could debate about how much Google had contributed to the obesity epidemic while improving our techno-lives, but to be fair, Google Voice Search is a pretty nifty move by Google. \u00a0Google has been continuing to build on its development, making our online activity even lazier easier.<\/p>\n<p>Last month Google did some upgrades on Google voice search, enabling Google search to connect with your other Google accounts to deliver personal information to users. In this post we\u2019ll be going into more depth about this new update, and what we can expect regarding the future of voice search.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Google Voice Search? I Know it Seems Obvious, But\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While defining what Google Voice Search is seems totally gratuitous, it\u2019s necessary considering Google\u2019s plethora of projects and overlapping names. Mainly we need to distinguish Google Voice Search from <a href=\"\/google-voice-for-mobile\">Google Voice<\/a>. Google Voice is a voicemail service, whereas Google <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/15\/voice-search-seo\">Voice Search<\/a> lets users input search queries and mobile commands via speech. I know, right? Calm down Google.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Use Google Voice Search: New Google Voice Search Commands<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Google Voice Search is primarily intended for mobile users, as the voice function makes it easy to search Google without using cumbersome touchpads or the QWERTY keyboard. Using Google Voice Search is as simple as a tap \u2013 just hit the voice button you can find alongside the Google search box and ask the all-knowing Googs for help.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4492cbf0-3608-46c4-a2ee-36f0ce4fa03e\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-search-by-voice-1.jpg\" alt=\"google voice search help\" width=\"474\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Image taken from Google Search Insights<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Until recently, Google Voice Search was primarily meant for entering <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">search queries<\/a>, but since August 2013, Google Voice Search can be used for more complex commands that relate to personal data. Some ways to take advantage of the new Google voice search commands include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flights:<\/strong>\u00a0Ask Google \u201cIs my flight on time?\u201d and you\u2019ll get info on your upcoming flights and status updates on current flights.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reservations:\u00a0<\/strong>Ask for \u201cmy reservations\u201d and Google will show you your upcoming dining plans. Ask for info about \u201cmy hotel\u201d to get your hotel name and address, along with directions on how to get there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Purchases:<\/strong>\u00a0Ask Google search for \u201cmy purchases,\u201d and you\u2019ll get the status of current orders.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plans:<\/strong>\u00a0Ask Google \u201cWhat are my plans for tomorrow?\u201d to see a summary of upcoming appointments, flights, reservations and events.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Photos:<\/strong>\u00a0Say \u201cShow me my photos from Europe\u201d to see the photos you uploaded to Google+. You can also ask for \u201cmy photos of dogs\u201d if you want to see all the shots of dogs you\u2019ve taken over the year. Google automatically recognizes the type of photo you\u2019re asking for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cool commands like these have already been available for <a href=\"\/google-now\">Google Now<\/a> users, but now that they\u2019re built into Google voice search, anyone can take advantage of commands like these and let Google be your personal assistant.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally you need to be signed in to your Google account for these new voice commands to work, since Google has to delve into your calendar and Gmail to obtain this info. If the whole idea of this creeps you out (as it will some people) you can turn off Google voice search options in your Google account settings.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Google Voice Search: Performing on A Device Near You<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Android Google Voice Search:<\/strong> Google voice search for Android comes baked in to modern Android devices, and can easily be accessed by the voice button beside the Google search widget.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"02ae43ce-3c2d-4840-9ba8-a2ea0878ab3c\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-voice-search-on-android-1.jpg\" alt=\"google voice search settings\" width=\"500\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Photo by <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/johanl\/4372604917\/in\/set-72157623336975827\">Johan Larsson<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Android users can do more than just Google voice searches \u2013 they can use voice action commands to conduct specific actions on Android devices.

Digital devices have made it possible to do absolutely no preliminary planning whatsoever \u2013 just leap into your car and let Google figure out where the nearest JoAnn Fabrics is. Efforts in predicting on-the-move voice search queries could be the next big thing for PPC.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/04\/mobile-advertising\">Mobile search<\/a> queries already tend to be pithy, and we can expect the same with many search queries conducted by voice. Users suppose that the longer they speak, the less chance they have of being interpreted correctly, so they keep most queries brief. In truth, voice interpretation has come a long way in the past few years, but we\u2019re not accustomed enough to trusting voice tools yet.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s Next For Google Voice Search?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/01\/knowledge-graph-conspiracy-confirmed\">Conspiracy theorists<\/a> will likely have a field day with Google Voice Search \u2013 do we even want to talk about the possibility of Google collecting data for voice recognition?
