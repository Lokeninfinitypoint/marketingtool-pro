It continuously reviews and assesses a user\u2019s behavior with the goal of improving their experience on the platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Explore Page.\" width=\"644\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92638 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp 644w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1-480x447.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Whether you\u2019re searching or scrolling, the Instagram algorithm decides which content ends up on your screen.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In more practical terms, the Instagram algorithm acts like a personalized content curator, showing you what it thinks you&#8217;ll like most across your feed, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-story-ideas\/\">Stories<\/a>, Explore page, and Reels. It learns from how you interact with the content it shows you to predict which content and creators will keep you engaged and encourage you to spend more time on the app.<\/p>\n<p>This is a really important concept for marketers to understand. The algorithm\u2019s primary goal is to keep users engaged in the app. If your content serves that purpose, it\u2019ll show it to more people more often. We\u2019ll dig <em>way<\/em> into how to align your goals with the algorithm throughout this guide.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Not sure what to post on Instagram?<\/strong> Get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download\">Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar<\/a> for a year\u2019s worth of ideas.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does the Instagram algorithm work?<\/h2>\n<p>In general terms, the Instagram algorithm uses a set of signals, or ranking factors, to prioritize the content it places at the top of a user\u2019s feed.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not the whole story. There isn&#8217;t just one Instagram algorithm. It\u2019s actually a collection of algorithms, processes, and classifiers that prioritize content. And increasingly, <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/features\/explaining-ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI does the job<\/a> more than algorithmic code.<\/p>\n<p>Each part of the app, such as your main feed, Stories, Explore page, and Reels, has its own method for selecting your content and sometimes uses different signals to do so. As you expand the type of content you post on Instagram, it\u2019ll help to know how each one works.<\/p>\n<div id=\"top-instagram-ranking-factors\"><\/div>\n<h2>Top Instagram algorithm ranking factors<\/h2>\n<p>Things get real murky when you look under the hood of Instagram\u2019s decision-making AI systems. For our purposes, the most important thing to remember is that it still relies on a set of ranking factors to inform its decisions. And that\u2019s what we can use to nudge our content up to the top.<\/p>\n<p>To that point, three ranking factors play the most significant roles in how Instagram prioritizes content.<\/p>\n<h3>Relationship between creator and viewer<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve interacted with content from a creator, Instagram is more likely to place more of their content in your feed. As a marketer, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">get engagement<\/a> on your content. The more likes, comments, and shares you get, the more often your posts will be visible.<\/p>\n<h3>User interest<\/h3>\n<p>This ranking factor is based on the type of content a user typically interacts with. If someone engages with content that\u2019s similar to yours (or a creator that\u2019s similar to you), the algorithm will show them your posts more often.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Instagram post about knitting.\" width=\"378\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92639 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp 378w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn-189x300.webp 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Into knitting? Expect to see content from new knitters on Instagram.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Relevancy<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram assigns a relevancy score to every piece of content. It\u2019s based on factors like recency and connection to trending topics. Consistent publishing and staying up-to-date with trends will help your content succeed.<\/p>\n<h3>Adherence to guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>While not officially a ranking factor, content that\u00a0<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">violates Instagram\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/policies\/community-standards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Community Standards<\/a> will be withheld<\/span> from showing up on users\u2019 feeds. It\u2019s a good idea to familiarize yourself with what Instagram considers unacceptable content.<\/p>\n<div id=\"instagram-ranking-factors-by-platform-feature\"><\/div>\n<h2>Instagram ranking factors by platform feature<\/h2>\n<p>There are different rules and signals for each feature in the app. Notice, though, that they all fall into two buckets: How have other users treated this content so far? And how has this user behaved in the past?<\/p>\n<h3>2025 Instagram Feed algorithm<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram uses a dedicated AI called the <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/features\/explaining-ranking\/ig-feed\/?referrer=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Feed AI system<\/a> to select, rank, and deliver content to your feed.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the system works. When you log in, the system gathers 500 posts from accounts you follow. Then it uses a model to predict which you\u2019ll \u201cfind most relevant and valuable.\u201d And finally, the AI assigns a relevance score to each post and places them in order by that score (with a little nudge to make sure you\u2019re seeing a variety of content).<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the predictions the AI system makes and some of the signals that influence it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to reshare a post?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How often you\u2019ve shared that creator\u2019s posts in the past.<\/li>\n<li>How many times that post has already been shared.<\/li>\n<li>How many times you\u2019ve shared any post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to click on the profile of the post\u2019s author?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How many times you\u2019ve viewed the creator\u2019s profile and posts in the past.<\/li>\n<li>How many times the creator\u2019s profile has been clicked by followers.<\/li>\n<li>How many times users in general have clicked on the creator\u2019s profile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to spend 10 seconds on the first post?\u00a0<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How much time you\u2019ve spent viewing the creator\u2019s posts.<\/li>\n<li>How many videos you\u2019ve viewed.<\/li>\n<li>How many times you\u2019ve viewed the creator\u2019s content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For marketers, the key takeaway is that if your content is generating clicks, shares, and views, it\u2019ll likely receive more exposure on Instagram. Check out the tips later on to see how you can give that process a boost.<\/p>\n<h3>2025 Instagram Reels algorithm<\/h3>\n<p>For Reels, the AI system behind ranking and displaying content is called <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/features\/explaining-ranking\/ig-reels-chaining\/?referrer=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Reels Chaining<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Just like with the Instagram Feed AI system, there is a similar list of predictions and influential signals for Reels. However, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, recently provided a more impactful and succinct explanation of ranking on Reels.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Instagram post from head of Instagram.\" width=\"671\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92640 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp 671w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam-480x429.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 671px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DFFyRp-pINJ\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DFFyRp-pINJ\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram post<\/a>, Adam first explained the two types of rankings on Instagram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connected reach:<\/strong> The accounts that follow you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unconnected reach:<\/strong> The accounts that don\u2019t follow you yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then, he listed the three most important metrics creators should follow to improve their Reels rankings and why they\u2019re important to Instagram.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Average watch time:<\/strong> The average amount of time a Reel is watched by all users. It tells Instagram how much of a video a user is likely to watch.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Likes per reach:<\/strong> The ratio of likes a real received compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen it. This tells Instagram whether future users are likely to enjoy a video.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sends per reach:<\/strong> The number of times a video has been shared via direct message, compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen the Reel. This helps predict whether a user will share a video with other accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2025 Instagram Stories algorithm<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/features\/explaining-ranking\/ig-stories\/?referrer=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Stories AI system<\/a> shares some crossover with the Feed AI system. Here are a few of the predictions and signals that are unique to how Stories are ranked:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to click on a Story that appears at the top of your page?\u00a0<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How much time you spend viewing Stories.<\/li>\n<li>How many Stories you\u2019ve viewed from that account.<\/li>\n<li>How often you view posts from the Story\u2019s creator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely is it that you and the Story\u2019s creator are closely connected?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How many times you\u2019ve reacted to the creator\u2019s Stories in the past.<\/li>\n<li>Your stated relationship to the creator.<\/li>\n<li>The number of messages you\u2019ve exchanged with the creator.<\/li>\n<li>Your connection to the creator on Facebook.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to click to reply to a Story after viewing it?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How much time you\u2019ve spent viewing the creator\u2019s Stories.<\/li>\n<li>How many times you\u2019ve interacted with the creator\u2019s Stories.<\/li>\n<li>How many Stories you have not seen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to send a like?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>How many of the creator\u2019s posts you have clicked to like.<\/li>\n<li>The first type of reaction you had to a post in the group.<\/li>\n<li>The number of times you\u2019ve viewed a Story by that creator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2025 Instagram Explore Page algorithm<\/h3>\n<p>And finally, there\u2019s the<a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/features\/explaining-ranking\/ig-explore\/?referrer=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Instagram Explore Page AI system<\/a>. Since the Explore Page is where users go to find content from accounts they don\u2019t follow yet, understanding this algorithm is crucial for follower growth.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Explore Page\" width=\"365\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92641 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp 365w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel-183x300.webp 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Explore Page is where new viewers can spot your content.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Before content is scored and ranked for a user&#8217;s Explore Page experience, it undergoes an initial filtering process.

What ends up in the Explore grid is content that the user is most likely to engage with.<\/p>\n<p>The Explore recommendation engine uses a very long list of predictions and ranking factors. Here are a few of the ones you should know about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How much time will you likely spend watching a Reel?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The total amount of time people have spent watching the Reel.<\/li>\n<li>The authors of videos you\u2019ve watched in the past.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Are you likely to click \u201clike\u201d on a Reel?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The Reels you\u2019ve clicked to like before.<\/li>\n<li>The authors you tended to give likes to before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>How likely are you to follow the author of a Reel?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Which authors you\u2019ve followed in the past.<\/li>\n<li>The number of followers the author received through the Reel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>Read this if you\u2019re trying to get more attention online: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download\">The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation: 25 Ideas (+Tips &amp; Examples)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"8-tips-to-use-the-instagram-algorithm-to-your-advantage\"><\/div>\n<h2>8 tips to use the Instagram algorithm to your advantage<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to the Instagram algorithm, knowing is half the battle. Doing is the other half. So let&#8217;s apply what we\u2019ve learned to some<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/09\/instagram-marketing-strategy\"> Instagram strategies<\/a> that\u2019ll help your content reach more users\u2019 screens.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Post at the right time<\/h3>\n<p>When you publish content on Instagram matters for two reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First off, recency is an important ranking signal for the Instagram algorithm. So if you post around the times your audience is looking, yours will be the freshest content available.<\/p>\n<p>Second, you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting some initial engagement on new content early if you post at the right time. Since Instagram likes to show us content that other users have liked and shared, that early bump could snowball into more views.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a guide that\u2019ll help you figure out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">best time to post on Instagram<\/a> for your brand based on several studies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - when to post chart.\" width=\"897\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92940 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp 897w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Post for engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram mentions engagement in almost every discussion of how its algorithms and AI systems rank content. Getting more likes, shares, and comments should be a top priority for all the content you publish there.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">boost the engagement<\/a> on your Instagram posts, Stories, and Reels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish quizzes, questions, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/04\/instagram-story-ads-polls\">polls<\/a> that encourage a response.<\/li>\n<li>Post current topics people want to talk about.<\/li>\n<li>Review the<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> analytics<\/a> for various content types to determine which ones are most effective.<\/li>\n<li>Use carousel posts, as they<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/instagram-carousels\/379311\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> tend to receive higher engagement<\/a> on average.<\/li>\n<li>Run <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contests and giveaways<\/a> for likes and shares.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Giveaway post\" width=\"382\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92642 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp 382w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway-191x300.webp 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use <\/em><em>giveaways like this to expand your following and quickly generate a high level of engagement.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Loop your Reels<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little hack to increase the time people spend watching your videos: loop them.<\/p>\n<p>Looping a video means it automatically replays from the beginning without a pause. Many people who view it will let it roll a few times before moving on, effectively doubling or tripling your average view time.<\/p>\n<p>To loop a Reel, make the end flow into the beginning so it seems to go on forever.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Loop post on Instagram\" width=\"277\" height=\"489\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92644 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp 277w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1-170x300.webp 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Be active in the comments<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to multiply those engagement numbers and catch the algorithm\u2019s attention is by jumping into the conversations happening on your content.<\/p>\n<p>When someone comments on your post, reply to them as quickly as possible. Ideally, they\u2019ll respond to you, and you\u2019ll get credit for more engagement.<\/p>\n<p>You can really go big here and tag another account in your caption or comments. That\u2019ll encourage them to respond and maybe even pull in some of their followers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Brand answering questions in Instagram.\" width=\"413\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92647 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp 413w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions-207x300.webp 207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Answering questions is good for engagement, ranking, and sales.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Create content people want to share and save<\/h3>\n<p>Sharing is another strong signal to the Instagram algorithm that people like what you publish. Plan to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">create content<\/a> that&#8217;s designed to be shared, and watch your impressions soar!<\/p>\n<p>What type of content is shared the most? That\u2019ll depend on your specific audience. But humor is a great place to start. Find some inside jokes that your followers will relate to, and they\u2019ll hit the share button on it hard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Real estate Instagram joke post.\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92645 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp 338w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor-169x300.webp 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A little inside humor will get shared amongst your followers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget about content saves\u2014they also tell the algorithm to get your posts in front of more people. Think about the type of information you save for later. Sure, it could also be funny posts. But how-to content, such as recipes and DIY videos, is also a good option, as people often need to refer back to it as they work on the task.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Use Instagram SEO<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a> isn\u2019t just for Google (although you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google\">optimize your Instagram posts<\/a> to get found on search). Instagram has a keyword search function, which means you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/07\/instagram-seo\">optimize your content and account<\/a> to take advantage of it. And if you\u2019re the top post for popular searches, you\u2019ll get more views and engagement, which feeds into Instagram\u2019s content ranking process.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Instagram profile.\" width=\"840\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92646 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp 840w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio-480x343.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Work your most important keywords into your profile bio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to do SEO on Instagram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword research:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Find broad and niche keywords<\/a> your audience would search for to find content like yours.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your profile:<\/strong> Include relevant keywords in your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\"> bio<\/a> and, if possible, your username.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your posts:<\/strong> Use more of those keywords in your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-captions-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">captions<\/a>, voiceover scripts, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your images: <\/strong>Add even more keywords to your image alt texts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Publish a variety of content<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"7\"><\/ol>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen, Instagram has a different ranking system for every content type on the app, and they all interconnect (likes to posts can boost your Reels, for example).<\/p>\n<p>To get the entire ranking machine working in your favor, keep a steady flow of different types of content in your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-marketing-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media<\/a> publishing calendar.<\/p>\n<p>Tight on time? Try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-repurposing\">repurposing content<\/a>. Pull a still image from a Reel and use it as a static post. Or post part of a longer feed video to your Stories. With a bit of creativity, you can increase how often you publish on Instagram without a lot more work.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Promote your Instagram account<\/h3>\n<p>While your Instagram account will help promote your business, you can flip the script and use your business to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> promote your account<\/a> (and multiply your viewer and follower counts).<\/p>\n<p>Here are several ways to get more eyes on your Instagram content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In email: <\/strong>Let your subscribers know there\u2019s more great content available on your Instagram account<\/li>\n<li><strong>On your website: <\/strong>Add links to your account and preview some of the content there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>On other social networks: <\/strong>Have a big Facebook or TikTok audience? Ask them to follow you on Instagram, too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-person:<\/strong> If you have a physical location or local customers, post scannable signs or cards that link to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp\" alt=\"Instagram algorithm - Instagram images on a website.\" width=\"936\" height=\"472\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92648 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote-480x242.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Make the Instagram algorithm work for you<\/h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, you and Instagram are on the same team.
