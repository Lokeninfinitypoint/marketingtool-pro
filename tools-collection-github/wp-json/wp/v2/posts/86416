No matter how amazing your products or services, how well-trained your employees, or how excellent your customer service, there will always be situations when someone is dissatisfied with their interaction with your business or finds that your product or service doesn&#8217;t meet their needs and expectations.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you have zero control over the situation! So how can you manage your online reviews to limit the negative impact on your business?

Here are a few ways that happens.<\/p>\n<div id=\"reviews-appear-in-search-results\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Reviews and star ratings appear in search results and maps&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>When people search for businesses, products, or services on search engines or map pages, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-citations\">review sites<\/a> not only appear in search results but also as featured snippets where review counts and star ratings are visible and highlighted even before users click on the result.<\/p>\n<p>Google displays reviews and star ratings in both search results and local pack results for businesses listed on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/10\/create-google-my-business-account\">Google Business Profile<\/a> (formerly Google My Business) or Google Maps.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp\" alt=\"google business listings for roofers\" width=\"858\" height=\"414\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-business-listings-for-roofer-480x232.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Google includes a &#8220;Reviews from the web&#8221; section in various business results and key phrases, aggregating reviews from relevant networks. In regular search results, when displaying a business profile from a review network, star ratings, and review counts are also presented.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp\" alt=\"reviews from the web on google\" width=\"742\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86598\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp 742w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-from-the-web-on-google-480x384.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On Bing local and maps results, review information and star ratings may be sourced directly from partner networks such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-reviews\">Facebook<\/a>, OpenTable, TripAdvisor, or others depending on the search query.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/what-is-duckduckgo\">DuckDuckGo<\/a>, a private search engine, exclusively partners with Yelp to display business results, including reviews, for users.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Want to learn how to get more traffic and leads from search engines?<\/strong> Get the free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"reviews-appear-across-the-web\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. &#8230;And almost everywhere else on the web<\/h3>\n<p>Multiple websites collect online reviews, each serving different purposes and attracting distinct types of audiences and review readers. For instance, individuals planning a vacation often visit travel-specific sites to see experiences and photos shared by previous travelers. On the other hand, job seekers read reviews on job sites posted by current and former employees.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the different types of review websites:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Business directories,<\/strong>\u00a0such as Google Business Profile (Google Maps), Trustpilot, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-claim-a-business-on-yelp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yelp<\/a>, list businesses and allow customers to rate them and leave reviews. Find out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">top business listing sites<\/a> here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retail websites <\/strong>like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and other ecommerce sites allow customers to review products they purchased and share their interactions with businesses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Travel review and booking networks<\/strong> like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, Airbnb, and others enable travelers to review hotels, hosts, restaurants, and other travel-related services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Job networks and review sites,<\/strong> such as Glassdoor or Indeed, enable current and former employees, as well as job applicants, to review their employers, salaries, and benefits, share insights into the interview process, and office culture, and discuss their overall experiences.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media networks<\/strong> like Facebook allow users to leave feedback, comments, and reviews on business pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Online complaint sites<\/strong> like RipOff Report or Better Business Bureau (BBB) provide platforms for customers to express dissatisfaction with products or services they have purchased.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Niche review websites<\/strong> like Capterra or G2 cater specifically to software buyers, and platforms such as <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/angi-business-listing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Angi<\/a> and DealerRater focus on local services and the car buying experience, respectively.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/angi-reviews.webp\" alt=\"example of reviews on angi\" width=\"850\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/angi-reviews.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/angi-reviews-480x338.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"positive-reviews-drive-clicks\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Positive reviews are engaging and drive clicks<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/review-search-click-through-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Research from BrightLocal<\/a> shows that businesses with positive 3 to 5-star reviews receive 25% more clicks from local pack results. Additionally, 82% of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase, spending an average of 14 minutes on review sites before making a decision. Positive reviews can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">improve traffic to your site<\/a> and boost revenue.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"negative-reviews-can-decrease-traffic\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Negative reviews can lead to a decline in traffic<\/h3>\n<p>At the same time, negative reviews can be highly damaging. For example, a well-publicized<a href=\"https:\/\/www.landers.com.au\/legal-insights-news\/defamatory-google-reviews-plastic-surgeon-awarded-damages-for-untrue-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> lawsuit in Australia revealed<\/a> that a plastic surgeon experienced a 23% drop in online traffic after a fake, damaging review was posted on Google Maps.<\/p>\n<div id=\"unhappy-customers-more-likely-to-review\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Unhappy customers are more likely to leave reviews<\/h3>\n<p>According to findings from Inc.com, when customers are unhappy, there&#8217;s a 91% chance they won&#8217;t do any business with that company again. Moreover, they are 10 to 15 times more likely to share their negative experience with others, often by posting bad reviews on online platforms about the product or service quality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example.webp\" alt=\"example of review from competitor\" width=\"878\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83701\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example-480x272.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, only 1 out of 10 happy customers typically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">leave a positive review<\/a>, indicating that many people may not remember positive experiences that long because when they are buying, they expect good service from businesses. Negative experiences tend to be more impactful and remembered longer.<\/p>\n<div id=\"positive-reviews-help-zero-click-searches\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Positive reviews can help with zero-click searches<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/zero-click-searches\">Zero-click search<\/a> is when users search for something on a search engine like Google but do not click any links in the results. <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nearly 60%<\/a> of searches result in no clicks. There are several reasons behind this phenomenon, such as people using search engines for spell checking or relying on widgets and highlighted information to quickly find answers to basic questions like &#8220;How old is Brad Pitt?&#8221; or &#8220;What day of the week is Christmas this year?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp\" alt=\"example of zero-click search result\" width=\"886\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp 886w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/example-of-zero-click-search-result-480x318.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Similarly, in business-related, local, product, and service searches, many users conduct research on companies and look for things like phone numbers, addresses, or feedback.<\/p>\n<p>It results in zero-click when they look up business information including star ratings and reviews directly in the search snippets. That\u2019s why the appearance of positive reviews can be as important as the company\u2019s website itself in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<div id=\"better-reviews-correlate-better-results\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Better online reviews have a direct correlation with higher CTRs, traffic, and sales<\/h3>\n<p>Positive online reviews and good star ratings can drive increased traffic and sales to a website in two ways:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Firstly, higher star ratings in search engine snippets enhance the chances of users clicking through to gather more information and conduct further research on the product or service, possibly leading to a purchase. At the same time, negative star ratings can deter users from clicking on a company website, and as proof, research by BrightLocal shows that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/review-search-click-through-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a> improvement in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rates<\/a> can be achieved with favorable reviews on Google results. As mentioned earlier, bad reviews can significantly impact <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rate<\/a>, just like with the plastic surgeon who saw a 23% drop in online traffic after a single bad review that appeared on top of Google results.<\/li>\n<li>Secondly, reviews <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/limited-time-offers\/\">influence traffic<\/a> and sales by influencing Google&#8217;s prioritization of businesses with better local presence and positive reviews in Google Maps. Based on<a href=\"https:\/\/firstpagesage.com\/reports\/google-click-through-rates-ctrs-by-ranking-position\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> findings by FirstPageSage<\/a>, achieving the top position in Google&#8217;s Local Pack results can lead to a 17% CTR.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"increase conversion rates - example of customer reviews on product landing page to help drive conversion rates up\" width=\"700\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews-480x410.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You&#8217;re probably going to click on results for a business with reviews like this over one with a lower star rating or no reviews.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"fake-reviews-impact-traffic-reputation\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Fake reviews can impact online traffic and reputation<\/h3>\n<p>Another unfortunate thing that can impact online reputation and sales is fake reviews. Fake negative reviews present a big challenge for businesses and are enabled by the anonymity of online platforms. It is estimated that <a href=\"https:\/\/retaintrust.com\/fake-reviews-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 23%<\/a> of online reviews are fake, and &#8220;bad actors&#8221; like competitors, scammers, or disgruntled employees can post false or defamatory information about a business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Review on Google.\" width=\"833\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp 833w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This not only leads to decreased star ratings but can also cause a significant drop in traffic, directly impacting sales. Addressing this issue can be expensive, requiring businesses to allocate resources towards damage control, increase marketing efforts to recover lost revenue, and in some cases seek legal advice.<\/p>\n<div id=\"leverage-positive-reviews-in-ppc\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Positive reviews can enhance PPC and social campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>One effective strategy for promoting positive reviews and ratings to improve CTR for your ads is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/18\/google-shopping-reviews\">integrate them into your PPC campaigns<\/a>. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a> allows you to add positive reviews as ad copy extensions. Google collaborates with<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2375474?hl=en#Supported_review_partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> supported review partners<\/a> to integrate and highlight these reviews under advertisers&#8217; search or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/20\/google-shopping-ab-testing\">shopping ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp\" alt=\"reviews in ppc campaigns example\" width=\"880\" height=\"543\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86601\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp 880w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns-480x296.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Star ratings from the stores are integrated and appear in the shopping ads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you can share positive reviews on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and others.
