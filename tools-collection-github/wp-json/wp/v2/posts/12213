And expensive. And confusing. Because how in the world do you figure out how to reserve a park bench or bus stop to advertise your business? And how much does it cost? What do you even design to place there? And, more importantly, does OOH even work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whew, let\u2019s take a breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">OOH may seem old school, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s out of date\u2014or out of reach. This form of advertising is tried and true, and, if you get it right, it can provide a great boost to your <a>business.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a2daad9d-5805-40f7-8458-cd6dc161dc70\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20example20outfront20media.jpg\" alt=\"out of home advertising example outfront media\" width=\"718\" height=\"645\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image courtesy of outfrontmedia.com.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this post we\u2019re breaking down everything small businesses need to know about OOH:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">What out-of-home advertising covers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Why you need to try OOH campaigns<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">How to implement those<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Plus, we\u2019ll share some of our favorite campaigns so that you can get inspired. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What is out-of-home advertising?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s just what it sounds like: advertisements that reach an audience when they are outside of their homes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The most common forms of OOH ads include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Billboards (digital or traditional).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Street \u201cfurniture,\u201d like park benches, bus stops, and kiosks.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Public transit placements, like bus and taxi wraps or subway and train ads.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Point-of-sale, or POS, displays like those you see in the back of taxi cabs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And there are far more less common examples, like sponsored cups at sporting events and ads on gas pumps or trash cans. The term is purposefully broad.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3a6af713-82bf-4299-a1ef-a462ba8ee10b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20goodyear.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising goodyear\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Out-of-home advertising, technically.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why should SMBs use out-of-home advertising?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First, OOH ads aren\u2019t skippable. You can\u2019t flip the channel to avoid a commercial or put an ad blocker up in real life. They\u2019re big, bold, and in your face, which means that they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/get-your-website-noticed-on-google\">get noticed<\/a>. Moreover, OOH gets rid of any skepticism that your product or service may not be available in a certain geographic area. If they\u2019re seeing the ad there, you can serve them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But let\u2019s talk numbers. <a href=\"https:\/\/broadsign.com\/blog\/out-of-home-advertising\/\">Neilsen and the OAAA<\/a> found that 46% of surveyed adults searched online for a brand or product they first saw in an OOH ad. <a href=\"https:\/\/broadsign.com\/blog\/out-of-home-advertising\/\">Ocean NeuroScience<\/a> found that consumers are 48% more likely to click on a mobile ad after seeing the same ad OOH first. OOH is the only traditional media category growing, with more brands dedicating portions of their marketing budgets to it. And, most importantly, consumers trust it. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e395133a-e599-44a2-bfa2-386a5f787621\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20trusted20ad20channels.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising trusted ad channels\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Finally, OOH advertising is a great way to show your brand\u2019s creative side. Because OOH is generally less actionable than, say, a paid search ad, you can showcase parts of your brand that are not conversion-driven. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to implement out-of-home advertising campaigns<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Like any marketing channel, start with choosing a goal for your OOH ad. It can be as broad or specific as you\u2019d like, from branding to announcing an event, new product, or expansion of services. Once you\u2019ve decided what message you want to advertise, it\u2019s time to choose the right OOH location for your ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To be clear, OOH advertising doesn\u2019t come cheap. A bit like display advertising, the cost is calculated based on impressions. The system is called gross ratings points (GRP), which is the number of impressions delivered by a media schedule for that particular location\u2014also known as a \u201cshowing.\u201d Placements are ranked by rating points, and 1 rating point = 1% of the market population; a lot of factors go into that calculation, including traffic, visibility, size, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re interested in running a month-long OOH ad with 50 rating points (reaching 50% of the population), you\u2019re going to spend a pretty penny. Which is why choosing the right placement and messaging is key. You don\u2019t need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a successful OOH campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When it comes to actually buying placements and designing your ads, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/themanifest.com\/advertising\/ooh\/agencies\">plenty of agencies out there to help<\/a>; it may be a good idea to learn from the experts at least the first time around. Keep in mind that not all OOH is print, as digital OOH (DOOH) is booming! Think of DOOH as the same as OOH, just \u2026 the digital version of a billboard, bus stop ad, or taxi cab display. And those placements are able to be bought programmatically and involve less physical labor (you\u2019d be surprised how long it takes city subway operators to switch out old ads with new ones). <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to create successful out-of-home advertising campaigns<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019re ready with a strategy and you know how you\u2019ll be buying OOH ads, you need to make sure you\u2019re making the most of this spend. Here are four strategies for creating crazy-successful out-of-home advertising campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Make it shareable<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First things first, come up with an idea to reach your goal. The best OOH ads are those that people want to snap a picture of and text to their friends or anything that makes someone do a double-take. The more time eyeballs are glued to your ad, the more likely the audience is to remember your brand and seek it out in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This 2017 campaign from Spotify highlighted some of the best playlists and users on their platform. It was definitely a crowd-pleaser\u2014I can attest to snapping pictures of these in subway stations!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3f6a0cb0-5048-48cf-b36d-e1a45998250e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20spotify.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising spotify\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"edd3c9e3-e36d-4f39-ae48-eb54ff1d4d62\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20spotify2.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising spotify2\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade mural is just begging Instagrammers to pose in front of it. Mostly because who doesn\u2019t love the B.I.G. in Brooklyn?!<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1ee3467d-0883-4efe-ad80-4b72f4f9675b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20mikes20hard.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising mikes hard\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Which brings us to the next strategy for creating successful out-of-home advertising campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Choose the location wisely<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is a big one. First, you want to choose a location based on budget, geography, and audience demo. Second, ad placement will determine the physical size of the ad, and therefore the design and copy\u2014think of a bus stop ad versus a billboard. And finally, consider proximity when you\u2019re choosing a placement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Think about it like this: The easiest way to find a good happy hour deal is to read the sidewalk signs when walking down the street. That type of advertising has a pretty high conversion rate (two tacos and a Tecate for $7?!) and could be perfect for your business if you\u2019re located in a busy area. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">McDonald&#8217;s leveraged proximity pretty well with these highway billboards. The company knows that those golden arches are universally recognizable: <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"42f96912-126e-4a61-9698-9d0430b88898\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20mcdonalds.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising mcdonalds\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Disney wisely used the allocated space for this Mary Poppins campaign, making it eye-catching and engaging\u2014and very accurate for Mary Poppins\u2019 brand!<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"08c193e4-f7de-4263-94c2-562d2c87a764\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20mary20poppins20returns.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising mary poppins returns\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Investigate the competition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before committing to a location or message, look around for OOH ads from your competitors. What\u2019re their goals and designs? What do you like about it and what are they missing? Leverage this competitive research in your own creative process and when choosing placements. It\u2019s up to you if you want to place an ad directly next to your competition, advertising lower prices or better quality. Just keep in mind that it could quickly get petty\u2014don\u2019t pick a public fight that you can\u2019t win. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once upon a time, Audi and BMW engaged in a billboard war. It all started with an Audi ad and spiraled into a social media sensation with fans of each brand photoshopping clever responses onto the billboard. Below is a taste, and you can read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/wonderfulengineering.com\/the-historic-bmw-vs-audi-billboard-ad-war-in-pictures\/\">here<\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"704dc23d-32e1-4df0-84d6-17e90934e872\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20BMW.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising BMW\" width=\"800\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Don\u2019t overdo it <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For OOH ads, less is more. Keep the copy short and direct; you don\u2019t want more than about ~14 words on your ad. That may not seem like much, but you can do a lot more than you think with it! The most important thing is to let your design do the talking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Knox campaign is a great example of concise copywriting that matches perfectly with the design (although I do feel a bit nauseated looking at pictures of creepy-crawlies up close).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7ef58729-6a6a-4249-bd4f-beba95f72134\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20knox.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising knox\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And this 2016 #WhatsHappening campaign from Twitter emphasizes the world news flying around the platform in a simple photo with a hashtag. <span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"756f38c4-3a01-4fe8-b599-3133ae0bbda0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/out20of20home20advertising20smokestack.png\" alt=\"out of home advertising smokestack\" width=\"800\" height=\"224\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0Start brainstorming your new OOH advertising campaigns<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We\u2019ve just gone through everything small businesses need to know about out-of-home advertising campaigns, so it\u2019s your move, now.
