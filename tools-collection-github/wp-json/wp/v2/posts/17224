By Cindy Joseph used multi-stage direct response marketing to improve<a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/partners\/blog\/how-to-build-an-abandoned-cart-email-sequence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> abandoned cart recovery<\/a>. First, they sent out a simple \u201ccomplete your purchase\u201d direct-response email:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaec5fb5-2933-42d4-ab1d-ee9808bd97f9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/boom-direct-response-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"direct response campaigns\" width=\"400\" height=\"796\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And it converted well, driving about $20,000 in sales over the course of a month. With a 9.4% conversion rate, you might be tempted to call it a day.<\/p>\n<p>But not BOOM! They saw that 90.6% of customers still needed to be nurtured. After one more direct-sales email, they sent out an informational piece. It was still direct-response, but instead of trying to close the customer on a sale, it was driving a different action: watch our video.<\/p>\n<p>This worked to persuade unconvinced buyers (and actually generated some residual sales). But the real magic happened when they offered customers a 10% off coupon two days later:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d3599e77-f39b-4602-8337-652306280dac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/direct-response-marketing-email-discounts.jpg\" alt=\"direct response email marketing\" width=\"400\" height=\"1102\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>After a brief pause from sales emails, this email successfully <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">leveraged urgency<\/a> and brought in another $5,000 in sales.<\/p>\n<p>But tracking user behavior was critical to achieving these results.<\/p>\n<p>First, the email series was only targeted to customers that started the checkout process and thus indicated an interest in the product.<\/p>\n<p>Second, once the customer completed their purchase, the emails stopped. This was important in protecting the brand image \u2013 imagine if you bought a product at full price and then two days later you received an email saying that new customers will get 10% off that same product. You\u2019d be a little annoyed. Worse, you might put off <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/13\/ecommerce-retention\">buying again<\/a>, expecting a discount offer to come through eventually.<\/p>\n<p>If BOOM! was selling a more complex product, they could take this tracking even further by following up with content that builds on messages customers engaged with. For example, sending a pdf shopping checklist for the product showcased in the video.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Use Direct Response Marketing for Recruiting<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s not even about sales. In the on-demand and sharing economy, many businesses are positioned as connectors between buyers and suppliers. Their success demands that they attract high-quality suppliers in addition to consumers that participate in their platform.<\/p>\n<p>In the rideshare battle, it\u2019s become so cut-throat that it\u2019s hard to compete on price anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Both Uber and Lyft have put tons of effort into attracting drivers as well as customers. Most of the driver recruitment has been done through direct response advertising.<\/p>\n<p>For example, this banner ad tries to incentivize respondents with a \u201cmassive sign-on bonus for new drivers\u201d:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"29a6c939-3374-4289-b788-d0626787e571\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lyft-direct-response-email-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"rideshare direct response marketing techniques\" width=\"600\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ridester.com\/lyft-driver-referral-code\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps the most iconic direct response ads have been the billboards:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"26b02292-2d8e-44fd-9c22-caed19c71d3c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/direct-response-billboard-examples.jpg\" alt=\"billboard advertising direct response\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridesharingservices.com\/2015\/08\/conniving-lyft-claiming-drivers-can.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>The offer is crystal clear: \u201cMake up to $1,500 every week\u201d.
